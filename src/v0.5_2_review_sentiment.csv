Like me, he is a book collector, and has been wanting the first volume of this title, ""A Dream of Red Mansions"" for some time now (he already has Volumes 2 and 3). I purchased this book through a third party vendor here on Amazon and the book arrived intact and in excellent, almost new condition. It is a hardcover, printed in China, and is the first edition. The book contains some beautiful color illustrations depicting important scenes from the book. A classic of Chinese literature, this is a story that will appeal to readers keen to explore the diversity in world literature."
1,0,0.22731481481481483,"This is one of the most interesting and profound novels I have read, a masterpiece of Chinese literature and a world class contribution. I genuinely enjoyed this translation of this 250-year old novel. The text flowed well and was clear and understandable.  The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature. The descriptions and characterization are so realistic you feel as if you have known those people and places for years. I would say this is a must-read!"

What I really liked about this edition was having Chinese and English face to face, which helps me practice reading my Chinese.  The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.

19,0,0.24568713450292395,"I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the ""Redists"", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!"

Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."

But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."
42,0,0.125,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize."

I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book."

There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s."
46,0,0.04347718253968253,"Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days."
47,0,0.14333333333333334,"When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point."

The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.

They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.

Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read)."

A fascinating story of one man's journey from being a 2-year-old tubercular Ethiopian orphan to a ""celebrity chef."" Fascinating peak behind the scenes at top restaurants and what it takes to be a ""star"" chef. In some ways a brutally honest book. Samuelsson doesn't always come out the hero. He is ambitious, driven, and single-minded,sometimes to his detriment. But he also shows great insight about the journey that has brought him to where he is now, a gift that may be as rare as the kind of talent he has. I noticed that some of the more negative reviews focus on the fact that the reader likes Samuelsson less after reading the book. Fair enough, but I would argue that discovering that someone you admire has some flaws, while disappointing, doesn't mean the book is bad. The writing is good. The story-telling engaging.

Marcus has faced a lot of adversity and there are some real high moments for him in his life as well as low. I have read a lot of chef bio's and this one ranks pretty high as a decent read. I love his description of food as he travels and works at many different places around the world. It has inspired me to buy some berbere spice to try on food at home. He talks A LOT about race. Being Caucasian, I knew that a person of different ethnicity might have to think about whether the treatment they receive in life is a result of their color just as easily as it is a result of their personality. But to be honest, I never realized someone could think about it this often. He touches on it probably in every single chapter of the book.

It definitely held my interest from the first page to the last.  It helps that Samuelsson has an interesting and less than typical life, which for me, made the book interesting and different than other chef memoirs I have read.  I also appreciated how candid the book was.  Samuelsson takes us through some of his biggest triumphs as well as his failures and more humbling moments.  I can understand why that doesn't make him a very likable protagonist to some readers but I thought it made the book feel more real and honest and made me feel like I had a better sense of Samuelsson as a person.  Sure at times he does come across as confident in his abilities, but I also thought it was well balanced by moments of humility and vulnerability.  I also won't disagree with those reviewers who said that he talks about how hard he works a lot, but I took it less as bragging so much as a depiction that being a chef of a high stature doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice. I also can find reading about egomaniacal chefs a turnoff, but Samuelsson didn't strike me as that."

The first copy was on my Kindle but there were so many ""gems"" and tidbits I wanted to underline (I still prefer a pencil for underlining) that I also bought a hardcover copy.  Marcus Samuelsson has had a very unlikely rise to Chef Stardom.  He was born in Ethiopia but he and his sister were adopted by loving Swedish parents at the tender age of 1.  The first chapter which describes how that came to be, is probably my favorite chapter of the entire book.  It is a truly sad and moving tale. He almost didn't become a Chef as in his own words, his adopted Mother wasn't a cook.  In fact, she hated cooking.  It was seen as a chore.  However, his grandmother loved cooking and Marcus' favorite memories as a Child are the Saturdays he would spend cooking side by side with his grandmother.  This was after Soccer practice - it turns out Soccer is his first and true love. His dream was to be a professional Soccer player but was too slight/short.  In many ways, it is his failure as a Soccer player that fueled his extremely hard work ethic in the Kitchen."
137,0,0.1634559884559885,"Besides winning Top Chef Masters in 2010, he is probably best known as the 3-star Chef of Aquavit in NYC in the mid 90's.  The bulk of the book eloquently describes the windy, grueling path he took to become a World famous Chef.  It was a lot less glamourous than a lot of people would think e.g. his first job involved getting up every morning at 6 AM and scrubbing the walk-in (refrigerator) from top to bottom.  I actually had the pleasure of working in the Pastry Kitchen at Mesa Grill in 1994-1995 and he is right - there is really nothing glamourous about working in a kitchen unless you are the Head Chef (who has had to work many years to get to the top).  Even though the bulk of the book talks about his various restaurant experiences, it is a very personal memoir.  The biggest shocker was that he fathered a daughter when he was 19 years old.  And although he was financially responsible for her well-being (at his Mother's insistence) he wasn't there for her emotionally or physically at all.  I have to say that learning this fact made me really dislike him.  He finally decides to meet her when she is a teenager and hopefully, they have a good relationship now.  The main reason he gives for not being a ""Father"" to her is that he didn't want to be the stereotypical African American male who fosters a child at 19.  In fact, he hides it from all of his employers and most of his friends.  The book touches a lot on the delicate topic of race.  As an Ethiopian who is raised in Sweden then working in NYC, in a field dominated by White males, I don't think he can escape that complex topic.  When he is snubbed by a fancy restaurant (apparently on appearance alone) he writes ""I made it a point not to dwell on the matter of race.  I believed in my knife skills, and my sense of taste, and my capability to listen and get things done. I was never afraid of hard work."""

Berbere is a very complex spice used in Ethiopian cuisine - among its many ingredients are: chile , black pepper, salt, cardamon, ginger, etc.  Marcus' diverse experiences has made him a very complex man/Chef.  Yes, I really disliked how he treated his own daughter yet I couldn't help warming up to him when he describes how he fought to have his Ethiopian sisters back home get Schooling.  And how he would often take a huge gamble on someone that didn't have the resume to work at a 3-start restaurant.

As long as you like American history, you will like this. The book takes a small slice of history and tells it almost novelistically. You can see the ruddy cheeks, mahogany paneling, feel the orations of Daniel Webster, learn about his expertise in politics, his high fees, and his decline. I remember so many cases from American History of yore that were fully explicated here - the Dartmouth College case - e.g. - and that I didn't quite get in high school or college. The book starts at Jamestown, and you learn of the horrors of that colony, which was a corporation, as was Plymouth Bay to the north. One learns about the precise reasons for the Boston Tea Party, not just the flaccid story of the courageous revolutionaries. Winkler tells us that all of the civil rights laws started with the rights of corporations, not people and that the first two - Dred Scott and a woman's right to be a lawyer - failed."

The 14th Amendment  (along with the 13th and 15th) was written to integrate freed slaves legally into society, was usurped by the corporations to not be considered organizations but a gathering of people. The last remaining drafter of the 14th Amendment lied to convince the Supremes that Corporations were part of the definition of ""persons as stated in the Amendment. A study done shows in a 30 year period some 300 14 Amendment cases were brought before the Supreme Court.

172,0,0.05602918586789555,"The author is a UCLA law professor and the book is very much a legal history which focuses on the cases which enabled corporate rights in America.  The author starts with the founding of the nation and some inherited perspectives on corporate rights inherited from English Law.  Early cases, before the complete proliferation of limited liability companies were for example, the Dartmouth College vs Woodward.  The author discusses ideas like the rights of chartered companies to be exempt from state meddling and the first company which really had to face such an issue was the Bank of the United States.  Early corporate disputes centered more around states rights to regulate vs corporate rights to engage in business on their own terms.  The author discusses how the turning point in the ideas of the breath of corporate rights came after the Civil War and the 14th amendment.  As absurd as it is, the granting of equal rights in constitutional terms suddenly turned into a cry for equality for corporations despite not being persons of any tangible form.  The author highlights the central arguments for corporate rights were constructed around the reality that corporations are funded by people who's rights should flow the corporations.  On the rebutting side was always the argument that corporations are set up to limit liability to the individual, are social constructions, and are not entitled to equal treatment.  The examples of this are discussed in multiple landmark cases where criminal liability became an issue and questions of obligations of directors.  Throughout corporate history in the US after the civil war, these ideas continued to cycle back and forth depending on the temperature of the Supreme Court.  It is quite interesting and things like funding of campaigns is a matter that has rich history the ignited concerns at the turn of the century.  The issues we face today rhyme with the past."
173,0,0.10799999999999998,"The author gives the full history of corporate rights and how the constitutional rights in a post civil war world were twisted into rights for corporations.  Subsequent to that, the exact meaning of that interpretation became central to many cases of the next 150 years.  This culminated with Citizens United and the free speech rights for corporations.  Onlookers into American society would find much of this completely ridiculous but nonetheless the libertarian corporate capitalist streak of the country has solidified the rights of corporations after many battles over the last 2 centuries.  It will take a long time and much effort to partially reverse such decisions and there is strong evidence recent cases are more judicial activism than what is normal.  If one wants to understand some of the subtleties and history of corporate lobbying for its rights in America, one must read this book."

The author, Adam Winkler, is a Professor of Law at UCLA and contributes to top national papers.  It's substantive and well written with excellent narrative flow.

This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call ""plot.""  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.

193,0,0.13922488038277508,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading ""Twilight"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng."

A fascinating story of one man's journey from being a 2-year-old tubercular Ethiopian orphan to a ""celebrity chef."" Fascinating peak behind the scenes at top restaurants and what it takes to be a ""star"" chef. In some ways a brutally honest book. Samuelsson doesn't always come out the hero. He is ambitious, driven, and single-minded,sometimes to his detriment. But he also shows great insight about the journey that has brought him to where he is now, a gift that may be as rare as the kind of talent he has. I noticed that some of the more negative reviews focus on the fact that the reader likes Samuelsson less after reading the book. Fair enough, but I would argue that discovering that someone you admire has some flaws, while disappointing, doesn't mean the book is bad. The writing is good. The story-telling engaging. Those qualities make it worth the read."

He enjoyed helping his Swedish grandmother in the kitchen.  His original choice of a career would have been as a soccer player and he was good but he was not tall.  He then turned to food.  I enjoyed learning how hard one has to work to become a good chef.  His Swedish parents did a good job raising him.  He had the self confidence to travel to different countries to train.  I liked his descriptions of spices and different restaurants that he either worked at or visited.  If I ever get to New York, I'd love to visit The Red Rooster.

I know that sounds odd but it is just another good story on the drive and determination that some immigrants have. Makes me feel a bit lazy at times as a native born American. Marcus has faced a lot of adversity and there are some real high moments for him in his life as well as low. I have read a lot of chef bio's and this one ranks pretty high as a decent read. I love his description of food as he travels and works at many different places around the world. It has inspired me to buy some berbere spice to try on food at home. He talks A LOT about race. Being Caucasian, I knew that a person of different ethnicity might have to think about whether the treatment they receive in life is a result of their color just as easily as it is a result of their personality. But to be honest, I never realized someone could think about it this often. He touches on it probably in every single chapter of the book. Not to say whether this is good or bad, just something I noticed. I would recommend this book to any foodie who might enjoy having a little background knowledge on the people they see on TV."

It definitely held my interest from the first page to the last.  It helps that Samuelsson has an interesting and less than typical life, which for me, made the book interesting and different than other chef memoirs I have read.  I also appreciated how candid the book was.  Samuelsson takes us through some of his biggest triumphs as well as his failures and more humbling moments.  I can understand why that doesn't make him a very likable protagonist to some readers but I thought it made the book feel more real and honest and made me feel like I had a better sense of Samuelsson as a person.  Sure at times he does come across as confident in his abilities, but I also thought it was well balanced by moments of humility and vulnerability.  I also won't disagree with those reviewers who said that he talks about how hard he works a lot, but I took it less as bragging so much as a depiction that being a chef of a high stature doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice. I also can find reading about egomaniacal chefs a turnoff, but Samuelsson didn't strike me as that."

The first copy was on my Kindle but there were so many ""gems"" and tidbits I wanted to underline (I still prefer a pencil for underlining) that I also bought a hardcover copy.  Marcus Samuelsson has had a very unlikely rise to Chef Stardom.  He was born in Ethiopia but he and his sister were adopted by loving Swedish parents at the tender age of 1.  The first chapter which describes how that came to be, is probably my favorite chapter of the entire book.  It is a truly sad and moving tale. He almost didn't become a Chef as in his own words, his adopted Mother wasn't a cook.  In fact, she hated cooking.  It was seen as a chore.  However, his grandmother loved cooking and Marcus' favorite memories as a Child are the Saturdays he would spend cooking side by side with his grandmother.  This was after Soccer practice - it turns out Soccer is his first and true love. His dream was to be a professional Soccer player but was too slight/short.  In many ways, it is his failure as a Soccer player that fueled his extremely hard work ethic in the Kitchen."
236,0,0.1634559884559885,"Besides winning Top Chef Masters in 2010, he is probably best known as the 3-star Chef of Aquavit in NYC in the mid 90's.  The bulk of the book eloquently describes the windy, grueling path he took to become a World famous Chef.  It was a lot less glamourous than a lot of people would think e.g. his first job involved getting up every morning at 6 AM and scrubbing the walk-in (refrigerator) from top to bottom.  I actually had the pleasure of working in the Pastry Kitchen at Mesa Grill in 1994-1995 and he is right - there is really nothing glamourous about working in a kitchen unless you are the Head Chef (who has had to work many years to get to the top).  Even though the bulk of the book talks about his various restaurant experiences, it is a very personal memoir.  The biggest shocker was that he fathered a daughter when he was 19 years old.  And although he was financially responsible for her well-being (at his Mother's insistence) he wasn't there for her emotionally or physically at all.  I have to say that learning this fact made me really dislike him.  He finally decides to meet her when she is a teenager and hopefully, they have a good relationship now.  The main reason he gives for not being a ""Father"" to her is that he didn't want to be the stereotypical African American male who fosters a child at 19.  In fact, he hides it from all of his employers and most of his friends.  The book touches a lot on the delicate topic of race.  As an Ethiopian who is raised in Sweden then working in NYC, in a field dominated by White males, I don't think he can escape that complex topic.  When he is snubbed by a fancy restaurant (apparently on appearance alone) he writes ""I made it a point not to dwell on the matter of race.  I believed in my knife skills, and my sense of taste, and my capability to listen and get things done. I was never afraid of hard work."""
237,0,0.18102564102564103,"I think the best way to describe both the book and the Chef is dubbing him the ""Berbere"" of Chefs.  Berbere is a very complex spice used in Ethiopian cuisine - among its many ingredients are: chile , black pepper, salt, cardamon, ginger, etc.  Marcus' diverse experiences has made him a very complex man/Chef.  Yes, I really disliked how he treated his own daughter yet I couldn't help warming up to him when he describes how he fought to have his Ethiopian sisters back home get Schooling.  And how he would often take a huge gamble on someone that didn't have the resume to work at a 3-start restaurant.  Or cook the identical meal he served the President of the United States to the neighborhood children in his Harlem apartment.

First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition."

Research shows that we have a greater need than ever for schools to address the nonacademic needs of students, as statistically significant minorities of school aged children have statistically significant emotional/behavioral vulnerabilities and lack of academic readiness.  (Jennings P., Lantieri, L, & Roeser, R., 2012, p. 372).  There are two main avenues through which this can be accomplished:  (1) creating a curriculum that promotes mindfulness (and SEL) through inquiry-based, collaborative, experiential learning (as already done in certain private schools, e.g., Montessori and Reggio Emilia); and (2) instructing teachers and students in the regular use of mindfulness based practices, preferably as part of an organization-wide or state-wide SEL program."

The authors offer a caveat: “(u)sing acceptance to make something go away is actually nonacceptance masquerading as acceptance…”  What is helpful here is remembering the impermanence of all things, that this too shall pass. Also, we should refrain from “shooting the second arrow”, that is, letting go of any judgment of the thought, idea, feeling, or sensation as “bad” or “wrong”.  Although this may sound, it is not easy – because sometimes what arises is difficult or painful or even intolerable.  (Id., p. 16)."

There is recognition of the importance that students maintain a childlike fascination with the subject matter.  The question is posed, how do we keep children interested, and not destroy their naturally inquisitive spirit, ending up like a “snuffed out candle”? (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 3, quoting Einstein)."

Intuition…comes from the Latin word intueri, meaning “to look upon, consider, contemplate.”  It is not “an unconscious, unreflecting, conditioned, or automatic way of seeing things.  It is all about being conscious and aware.  If we really look we have a chance of understanding, because what is within us is connecting with what we are observing.  Thus connectedness, or unity, goes hand in hand with learning mindfully.”  (Ibid.)."

They will need a level of motivation and insight in order to engage with the process.  Otherwise they will just pretend to go through the motions to keep the teacher happy, or – even worse – they will build up resistance and resentment to mindfulness, an attitude that might be difficult to shift.” (p. 144)."

(Boddhi, 1999).  The authors state that, instead of teaching mindfulness and “letting students figure out on their own how to apply it,” they teach mindfulness with the stated goals of managing stress, improving study performance (by learning to sustain attention and focus over a period of time), developing presence of mind rather than trying to multitask , and overcoming procrastination.

The concern here is that mindfulness could end up becoming a tool to enable students to be calm and compliant with a dull curriculum, rather than following a path paved with curiosity and kindness, with an aim of inner transformation."
294,0,0.16249999999999998,"Drs. Hassed and Chambers believe that applied mindfulness is justified by the results:  that hooking students and teachers into trying mindfulness (as a secular practice that enhances performance and reduces stress) will allow them to experience mindfulness.  The viewpoint is that once people begin practicing mindfulness, they will understand on an experiential level the benefits of such a practice, and then begin to apply it more broadly in their lives, that is, generalize mindfulness to other areas of their lives.  The concept of “applied mindfulness” will likely appeal to many within the public education system, with its focus on measurable results in attainment of educational skills.  However, this view of mindfulness arguably omits the heart of mindfulness:  which is to wake up to whatever is, in the present moment, and to allow what is there to just be, with loving-kindness and gentle curiosity.  A question that arises is, if the practice of “applied mindfulness” is results-driven and goal-oriented, is it still mindfulness?"
295,0,0.39999999999999997,"However, it is understood that our public education system is mandated, to the extent possible, to use secular methodologies shown to be effective by scientific research which will enable students to make measurable progress in skill acquisition.  Perhaps what we need are some additional goals in education, which incorporate skills which are not so measurable, such as kindness, empathy, and joy in learning?  Our society is so results driven, can we allow space for these priceless capacities to arise?"
296,0,0.1934343434343434,"Putting aside the issue of “applied mindfulness,” there are many positive aspects to this book.  For instance, the discussion of mindfulness and attention in the early part of the book is spot on.  The authors discuss how we are often not even aware of where our attention is, and that noticing what our attention is focused upon is the first step in developing mindfulness.  “Mindfulness is not a distraction from our worries.”  (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 9).  “Mindfulness meditation is…not a method of tuning out but rather of tuning in…..” (Id., p. 11).  “We cannot stop the mind from thinking” . . . . . but we can “learn to be less reactive to it or involved in it.” (Id., p. 10)."
297,0,0.16206060606060607,"One of the main thrusts of this book is the positive impact of mindfulness upon executive functioning skills, which are high level functions of the brain’s prefrontal cortex important for learning.  “Research shows that practicing mindfulness activates many of the same brain areas as those that are active when we are engaged in executive functioning…….particularly attention, short-term memory, regulating emotional impulses, planning, and mental flexibility.”  (Id., p. 24).  Strengthening these capacities is one of the primary purposes for the use of “applied mindfulness” according to the authors."

310,0,0.31999999999999995,"We are reminded of an important lesson from neuroscience: that whatever we practice becomes the habit of the mind.  “(W)e give power to whatever our attention is directed to.”  (Id., p. 11).  As  Dr. Dan Siegel often says, “neurons that fire together, wire together”.  Thus, the more we practice “unmindfulness”, the more we will reap the “costs” listed above.  Research has shown that mindfulness can “ literally shape our brain in ways that make it much easier to concentrate, remember and learn, regulate emotions and behaviors, reason and think abstractly.” (Id., p. 32)."
311,0,0.145,"In furtherance of cultivating mindfulness within the teaching environment, the authors suggest creating a mindful physical environment, regular practices of self-care, and a teaching style that is calm and enthusiastic, encouraging openness, and which uses mindfulness practices in the classroom.  The authors do recognize the importance of teaching mindfulness not as “a separate skill divorced from other aspects of the curriculum” but rather as something that is “integrated with other content.” (Id., p. 141).  There appears to be an assumption that teachers will intuitively know how to do such things as a result of their own mindfulness practices, as the authors do not deeply delve into how these things might be accomplished as a practical matter."
312,0,-0.21111111111111114,"However, this may be because one of the key points made by the authors is the importance of learning from failure.  They state that “(a) mindful response to failure is:"

329,0,0.0,Conclusion:
330,0,0.09702380952380953,"Mindful Learning covers a large range of territory, and has sufficient depth for an educator’s first introduction to Mindfulness.  The book is carefully written to avoid any religious, philosophical, or spiritual overtones, which might cause discomfort in the educational setting. The focus on the brain-based (or cognitive) aspects of mindfulness (e.g., improving executive functioning skills such as attention and working memory) give the book a solid grounding in educational science.  The practices included in the back of the book are well scripted, and useful.  While the book does not discuss needed changes in state-wide or school district-wide pedagogy to bring mindfulness into the mainstream of education, it does address some of the challenges associated with organizational change."
331,0,0.18333333333333335,"One concern that arose is the potential effect of divorcing of mindfulness from grounding in ethics (such as the Noble Eightfold Path), loving-kindness, ethical/moral values, or spiritual principles.  This book contains William James’ oft-quoted statement on “the importance of being able to focus attention as the ultimate education.” (Id., p. 5).  However, mindfulness is not just about the focusing of attention, but also about the attitude that we cultivate towards what we pay attention to, and how we act in response to what arises."
332,0,0.4833333333333334," While this book has omitted what many consider to be the true purposes of mindfulness: a path for transformation, liberation from suffering, wisdom, development of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity (the brahmaviharas), that may well have been intentional, in order to make delivery of the message of mindfulness more palatable to those within the educational system."
333,0,0.12727272727272726," It is encouraging that books such as Mindful Learning have arrived on the educational scene, which are helping to breathe new life into the movement to bring mindfulness-based approaches, which are consistent with social-emotional learning principles, into the realm of public education."

376,0,0.11574074074074074,"It had been only a few days since the end of the school year.  I stared down at the book titled Mindful Learning, written by Dr. Craig Hassed and Dr. Richard Chambers, mindfulness consultants at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  The cover, which looks like a chalkboard, triggered a flood of memories from the classroom.  Was I ready to read my first full-fledged mindfulness in education book for the summer?"
377,0,0.1130952380952381,"After a week or two of mindful waiting, I started reading, not knowing exactly what to expect.  I had chosen to read this book because it has been marketed toward people who work with high-school age children and above.  Other related books - “The Way of Mindful Education”, “Teach, Breathe, Learn”, and “Mindfulness for Teachers” – I read while teaching middle school.  Now that I had moved onto teaching older students, it seemed appropriate to explore a resource targeting this age group."
378,0,-0.08525641025641026,"True to the Aussie way of being, Hassed and Chambers adopt a casual tone, even when delving into complex topics such as neuroscience.  Throughout the book, they use the pronouns “we” and “us”, referring to the wider community as well as to themselves.  They also use brevity to their benefit, using the least possible words that still relay their thoughts. But blink and you might miss a transition, giving a feeling of abrupt turns.  Look closely and you’ll see how carefully they organized their book.  They begin by defining education and mindfulness before moving on to exploring mindfulness in student learning, which is the text’s main focus.  They then discuss mindfulness in creativity, sports, and relationships.  Later, the authors apply mindfulness to teachers, even laying out ways to work with those resistant to incorporating these practices into the classroom.  They follow by describing how mindfulness goes well beyond school walls.  For concluding thoughts, they briefly mention potential approaches that organizations can implement when incorporating mindfulness, along with common snafus they may face.  For takeaway tools, they include twelve sample exercises for teachers to try in or out of the classroom."
379,0,0.2111111111111111,"Instead of beginning with a definition of mindfulness, Hassed and Chambers first invite us to pause by asking the question, “What is education?”  It has taken me years to fully arrive at their view of education as a holistic endeavor where teachers and students can learn from any situation – an endeavor where teachers facilitate or elicit existing insight through inquiry and questioning.  Mindfulness supports this perspective.  I read about this holistic approach while in graduate school for teaching and learning, but I didn’t understand or embody it until I went so fully away from this view and back again after almost leaving the profession entirely.  Why is it that so many teachers lose sight of teaching as drawing out from within?  I still grapple with this question, trying to balance my own views with the existing structures in the public school district where I teach.  From this searching perspective, I fully appreciated the authors’ note - “The journey to becoming a mindful teacher and learner is a lifelong project” (2014, p.4)."
380,0,0.18579545454545454,"In our fast-paced world, mindfulness can appear counter-intuitive.  Instead of pausing to navel gaze, shouldn’t we be doing more to get ahead?  Hassed and Chambers efficiently and thoroughly address the misconception that mindfulness meditation is about stopping and clearing one’s thoughts.  They explain how it is more of a process of awareness and release from the grips of thinking, giving away our attachments to our thoughts.  They don’t contribute anything new to the existing foundational knowledge of mindfulness.  Rather, they organize information into a secular, digest-able fashion, using vignettes from the school setting.  Then, to boost our confidence and conviction about the importance of mindfulness in a world of skepticism, they ground us in the dominant language of science.  Explaining clearly how mindfulness practices can shape our brains to improve concentration, memorization, emotional regulation, reasoning, and abstract thinking, they convince even a skeptic to explore the potential of mindfulness to enhance (and even transform) our educational, recreational, and personal lives."
381,0,0.14372294372294372,"Hassed and Chambers’ find a niche in their attention to the effects of mindfulness on stress, focus, and performance in older students.  Like many others, I used to think that we need a certain bit of stress in order to perform better.  However, the authors illustrate how we can perform from a mindful state of calm and confidence, free from stress.  It’s worth looking up the Hassed mindfulness-based stress-performance graph to rethink your view on stress.  They convinced me that mindfulness is a valuable skill, mindset, and way of being that helps us reduce stress and enhance attention.  If you aren’t convinced by their graph, read their chapter on why attention matters – the costs of unmindfulness.  Wasting time, not understanding things, poor emotional well-being, and not enjoying life are just some of the outcomes of living in the dark."
382,0,0.16833333333333333,"What struck me about Hassed and Chambers is how intentional they are with their use of mindfulness in education.  Instead of leaving the effects of mindfulness on student learning up to chance, they have specifically created a program, Mindfulness for Academic Success (MAS), to apply mindfulness to studying.  This program came out of their personal realizations that people more easily comprehend mindfulness when the focus is more explicit.  They share a few exercises to give us a taste of MAS.  I tried out their study meditation where students work on a written task while noting any mental distractions on one side of the paper.  Experientially, I understood their intention of helping students fully acknowledge and accept distractions in order to fully let go of them.  This was my first encounter with a program focused so directly on academic behavior – I wish I had enrolled in this program as an overwhelmed undergraduate."
383,0,0.24529100529100528,"Their chapters on resilience, emotional development, and communication sometimes read like a self-help book, providing tips and explanations on how to practice mindfulness to promote these skills.  Although this tone can be perceived as superficial, it can also be construed as actually helpful in providing us with a broader view of what mindfulness can do for our students.  Hassed and Chambers even take the time to address creativity, movement, and relationships since school is not always just about academics; arts, athletics, and social events play a large part in many communities.  In addition, I found their chapter on eMindfulness – how paying attention helps us use media more wisely – timely and highly applicable for our ultra-connected young adults."
384,0,0.19702380952380952,"I particularly enjoyed their roadmap for building mindfulness practices in children throughout the years, so that they do not fall into “mindfulness fatigue”.  Hassed and Chambers begin with Elementary School – Years 1-3: “simple mindfulness exercises to provide some quiet at the start and end of class” and end with College or University: “Teach how mindfulness applies to leadership, professional development, higher executive functioning, and self-care” (2014, p.142-143).  It is powerful to envision what mindfulness can look like if woven into long-term educational planning.  Of course, this roadmap is only an example of what can happen, as educators very well know the intricate complexities of planning and implementing curricula in large educational systems."
385,0,-0.00535714285714285,"Lest you think Hassed and Chambers focus only on students, fear not.  They thoughtfully round out their mindfulness tour with a focus on the teacher.  As someone who has experienced almost all of the major barriers to teaching – burnout, stress, poor mental health, to name a few – it was cathartic to have someone put these difficulties into words and how mindfulness can help us to work through or around these so-called barriers."
386,0,0.1778846153846154,"Just when you get the sense that something might be missing from their whole tour, Hassed and Chambers admit that the attention training aspect of mindfulness can seem a little cold by itself.  They broaden mindfulness beyond the classroom by noting how mindfulness can be equally thought of as heartfulness.  They write, “The word mindfulness implies ‘mind’ – which many people equate to the brain – and so risks obscuring what is most important about learning to be more awake, open, and loving in each moment of life” (2014, p. 162).  As I arrived at the end of the book, I sensed some warm and fuzzies, fully opening to the potential of mindfulness to transform our way of being in the world."
387,0,0.21111111111111114,"Overall, I am filled with gratitude toward Hassed and Chambers for providing teachers, administrators, and parents with some clarity in our lifelong journeys to becoming mindful people and role models for our children.  I envision Mindful Learning as a useful resource for a school district or university interested in implementing mindfulness.  The text probably will appeal more-so to teachers of older students who are expected to study independently and become more aware of their learning habits, but the principles apply to every age level.  For a school district, it would be a great way for teachers to become more well-versed in what mindfulness actually is and how it can help.  The chapters can be used as stand-alone resources over a longer period of time, leaving plenty of room for discussion and dialogue.  After all, it is up to individuals and small groups to decide what to do with this valuable information."
388,0,0.18181818181818182,"Keep in mind as you continue your exploration of mindfulness in education that there is a multitude of resources to drawn from.

In short, these companies step up to the plate and do the hard work of actually solving hard-to-solve problems that their customers face.  They get outside of their echo chamber and look externally for information and inspiration.

I also think J.K Rowling did an excellent job on righting the book because she didn't leave any details out. The book is better than alot of other books because you are able to picture the scene in your mind. Harry Potter is a good book for kids around eight or older because in some parts it could be pretty scary.  Even though most of my friends read this book, I would defiantly recommend this book to any one else. The Harry Potter book series probably did such a good job selling the books because there are not many good books with suspense and magic. That's why I would recommend this book to others."

It took me a month and a half becuase I was busy with required school reading from Mr. Schrader. This book is the second in the fantasy genre series by J.K. Rowling.  The series main character is Harry Potter.  He is an orphan who finds himself with magical powers and an invitation to Hogwarts, a special school for wizards. I enjoy Harry as a character because he is adventurous, he never gives up, and is courageous in the face of danger although he may feel fear.The story takes place mostly at Hogwarts during Harry's second year.  One of my favorite parts was when Harry and Ron flew the car to Hogwarts and they land in the Whomping Willow. Another exciting part was when Harry talks to the snake at the Dueling Club and found out that he was a parcel toungue, one who has special powers to talk to snakes. Harry and his friends spend most of the book trying to find out who is opening the chamber of secrets and what secrets the chamber holds. Near the end the plot thickens when Harry most save Ron's sister Ginny from the giant snake Basilisk. To find out what happen, you'll have to read the book. I enjoy J.K. Rowlings writing style because it is descriptive, allows my imagination to run wild, and how she builds anticipation and surprises in her books for her readers.

The Sorcerer's Stone is a story of a boy, growing up with a miserable life, and with miserable people. But such a shock comes to him, when his identity is completely revealed (or so he thinks) The Chamber of secrets, has more mythology in it, more dark, evil, and more adventurous material, that has the reader begging for more. The Prisoner of Azkaban, is another great sequel, with just as much adventures as the first two. The Goblet of Fire, best yet. Has the most adventures in it.

543,0,0.3844791666666667,"  I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good book. I think that because the plot of the story is amazing. I also think J.K Rowling did an excellent job on righting the book because she didn't leave any details out. The book is better than alot of other books because you are able to picture the scene in your mind. Harry Potter is a good book for kids around eight or older because in some parts it could be pretty scary.  Even though most of my friends read this book, I would defiantly recommend this book to any one else. The Harry Potter book series probably did such a good job selling the books because there are not many good books with suspense and magic. That's why I would recommend this book to others."
544,0,0.29564935064935055,"I think the story was great because it was very exciting. It kept me turning the pages and reading as fast as I could. It took me a month and a half becuase I was busy with required school reading from Mr. Schrader. This book is the second in the fantasy genre series by J.K. Rowling.  The series main character is Harry Potter.  He is an orphan who finds himself with magical powers and an invitation to Hogwarts, a special school for wizards. I enjoy Harry as a character because he is adventurous, he never gives up, and is courageous in the face of danger although he may feel fear.The story takes place mostly at Hogwarts during Harry's second year.  One of my favorite parts was when Harry and Ron flew the car to Hogwarts and they land in the Whomping Willow. Another exciting part was when Harry talks to the snake at the Dueling Club and found out that he was a parcel toungue, one who has special powers to talk to snakes. Harry and his friends spend most of the book trying to find out who is opening the chamber of secrets and what secrets the chamber holds. Near the end the plot thickens when Harry most save Ron's sister Ginny from the giant snake Basilisk. To find out what happen, you'll have to read the book. I enjoy J.K. Rowlings writing style because it is descriptive, allows my imagination to run wild, and how she builds anticipation and surprises in her books for her readers. Another author in this genre that I would recommend is J.R.R. Tolkien."

This hero, who has managed to overcome his almost deadly experiances with Voldemort, is just a regular kid. For his definition of ""regular"" is completely different. Where he comes from, he is just as regular as anyone else. These books shall capture the readers' attension by revealing adventures, mythological creatures, and three best friends, who keep getting into trouble, but become hero's again. The Sorcerer's Stone is a story of a boy, growing up with a miserable life, and with miserable people. But such a shock comes to him, when his identity is completely revealed (or so he thinks) The Chamber of secrets, has more mythology in it, more dark, evil, and more adventurous material, that has the reader begging for more. The Prisoner of Azkaban, is another great sequel, with just as much adventures as the first two. The Goblet of Fire, best yet. Has the most adventures in it.

Brandon Massey has put together a collection of stories - some funny, some horrifying - but all of them hold your interest and you find yourself wondering, as you read each one, how this particular one can possibly turn out. To the credit of the many writers, the end is always unexpected and sometimes downright zany. The writing style of Tananarive Due's ""Upstairs"" is reminiscent of Joplin's Ghost, while Terrence Taylor's ""The Share"" is heart wrenchingly realistic in a totally abnormal way. Maurice Broaddus, with his ""Black Frontiers"" brings us a taste of our lost history, along with Christopher Chambers' ""Leviathan,"" a smooth reading but frightening story about the Middle Passage.

A fascinating story of one man's journey from being a 2-year-old tubercular Ethiopian orphan to a ""celebrity chef."" Fascinating peak behind the scenes at top restaurants and what it takes to be a ""star"" chef. In some ways a brutally honest book. Samuelsson doesn't always come out the hero. He is ambitious, driven, and single-minded,sometimes to his detriment. But he also shows great insight about the journey that has brought him to where he is now, a gift that may be as rare as the kind of talent he has. I noticed that some of the more negative reviews focus on the fact that the reader likes Samuelsson less after reading the book. Fair enough, but I would argue that discovering that someone you admire has some flaws, while disappointing, doesn't mean the book is bad. The writing is good. The story-telling engaging. Those qualities make it worth the read."

He enjoyed helping his Swedish grandmother in the kitchen.  His original choice of a career would have been as a soccer player and he was good but he was not tall.  He then turned to food.  I enjoyed learning how hard one has to work to become a good chef.  His Swedish parents did a good job raising him.  He had the self confidence to travel to different countries to train.

I know that sounds odd but it is just another good story on the drive and determination that some immigrants have. Makes me feel a bit lazy at times as a native born American. Marcus has faced a lot of adversity and there are some real high moments for him in his life as well as low. I have read a lot of chef bio's and this one ranks pretty high as a decent read. I love his description of food as he travels and works at many different places around the world. It has inspired me to buy some berbere spice to try on food at home. He talks A LOT about race. Being Caucasian, I knew that a person of different ethnicity might have to think about whether the treatment they receive in life is a result of their color just as easily as it is a result of their personality. But to be honest, I never realized someone could think about it this often. He touches on it probably in every single chapter of the book. Not to say whether this is good or bad, just something I noticed. I would recommend this book to any foodie who might enjoy having a little background knowledge on the people they see on TV."

It definitely held my interest from the first page to the last.  It helps that Samuelsson has an interesting and less than typical life, which for me, made the book interesting and different than other chef memoirs I have read.  I also appreciated how candid the book was.  Samuelsson takes us through some of his biggest triumphs as well as his failures and more humbling moments.  I can understand why that doesn't make him a very likable protagonist to some readers but I thought it made the book feel more real and honest and made me feel like I had a better sense of Samuelsson as a person.  Sure at times he does come across as confident in his abilities, but I also thought it was well balanced by moments of humility and vulnerability.  I also won't disagree with those reviewers who said that he talks about how hard he works a lot, but I took it less as bragging so much as a depiction that being a chef of a high stature doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice. I also can find reading about egomaniacal chefs a turnoff, but Samuelsson didn't strike me as that."

The first copy was on my Kindle but there were so many ""gems"" and tidbits I wanted to underline (I still prefer a pencil for underlining) that I also bought a hardcover copy.  Marcus Samuelsson has had a very unlikely rise to Chef Stardom.  He was born in Ethiopia but he and his sister were adopted by loving Swedish parents at the tender age of 1.  The first chapter which describes how that came to be, is probably my favorite chapter of the entire book.  It is a truly sad and moving tale. He almost didn't become a Chef as in his own words, his adopted Mother wasn't a cook.  In fact, she hated cooking.  It was seen as a chore.  However, his grandmother loved cooking and Marcus' favorite memories as a Child are the Saturdays he would spend cooking side by side with his grandmother.  This was after Soccer practice - it turns out Soccer is his first and true love. His dream was to be a professional Soccer player but was too slight/short.  In many ways, it is his failure as a Soccer player that fueled his extremely hard work ethic in the Kitchen."
699,0,0.1634559884559885,"Besides winning Top Chef Masters in 2010, he is probably best known as the 3-star Chef of Aquavit in NYC in the mid 90's.  The bulk of the book eloquently describes the windy, grueling path he took to become a World famous Chef.  It was a lot less glamourous than a lot of people would think e.g. his first job involved getting up every morning at 6 AM and scrubbing the walk-in (refrigerator) from top to bottom.  I actually had the pleasure of working in the Pastry Kitchen at Mesa Grill in 1994-1995 and he is right - there is really nothing glamourous about working in a kitchen unless you are the Head Chef (who has had to work many years to get to the top).  Even though the bulk of the book talks about his various restaurant experiences, it is a very personal memoir.  The biggest shocker was that he fathered a daughter when he was 19 years old.  And although he was financially responsible for her well-being (at his Mother's insistence) he wasn't there for her emotionally or physically at all.  I have to say that learning this fact made me really dislike him.  He finally decides to meet her when she is a teenager and hopefully, they have a good relationship now.  The main reason he gives for not being a ""Father"" to her is that he didn't want to be the stereotypical African American male who fosters a child at 19.  In fact, he hides it from all of his employers and most of his friends.  The book touches a lot on the delicate topic of race.  As an Ethiopian who is raised in Sweden then working in NYC, in a field dominated by White males, I don't think he can escape that complex topic.  When he is snubbed by a fancy restaurant (apparently on appearance alone) he writes ""I made it a point not to dwell on the matter of race.  I believed in my knife skills, and my sense of taste, and my capability to listen and get things done. I was never afraid of hard work."""
700,0,0.18102564102564103,"I think the best way to describe both the book and the Chef is dubbing him the ""Berbere"" of Chefs.  Berbere is a very complex spice used in Ethiopian cuisine - among its many ingredients are: chile , black pepper, salt, cardamon, ginger, etc.  Marcus' diverse experiences has made him a very complex man/Chef.  Yes, I really disliked how he treated his own daughter yet I couldn't help warming up to him when he describes how he fought to have his Ethiopian sisters back home get Schooling.  And how he would often take a huge gamble on someone that didn't have the resume to work at a 3-start restaurant.  Or cook the identical meal he served the President of the United States to the neighborhood children in his Harlem apartment.

The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature.

The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.

There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone.

She is just constantly moronic, and I can't think of a single real life female who would display such a chronic case of brainlessness.  I found it shameful the way Cate's character was portrayed as being at the total mercy of men and unable to care for herself.  As horrible as this is, make no mistake, this is what carries the movie.  It's unfortunate that the degradation of women is used for entertainment.

I have never been able to classify violence against women as entertainment, and I am very concerned about people who do.  For that reason, I wish I had never seen this movie.

I have to say, though, I was hoping to actually see ""Donnie"" get released from jail and possibly even become friends with ""Annie.""

Blanchett heads an amazing cast with Hilary Swank, Keanu Reaves, J.K. Simmons, Greg Kinnear and Giovanni Ribisi. Movies don't usually feature that many Academy Award winners and nominees for awards. Blanchett creates a very appealing character in Annie, a mystical woman who is trying to take care of her three sons after her husband is killed.

First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition."

There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.

831,0,0.23093434343434344,"The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read)."
832,0,0.7,A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.
833,0,0.125,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize."
834,0,0.20000000000000007,"I slogged through, and found the stories engaging, the descriptions of the culture fascinating, and the plotlines very different from western stories. The time invested in completing the series was a joy. Thankfully, a glossary of individual names, relationships, and even the family trees for the families most involved appears in each volume. I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book."

836,0,0.22010489510489512,"Nothing good lasts forever, whether we are talking about the Garden or this novel itself… Volumes 4 and 5 are thought to be written by Gao E a generation after Cao Xueqin’s untimely death.  There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s."
837,0,0.04347718253968253,"Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days."
838,0,0.14333333333333334,"When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point."

Instead of finding Jordana to be an exciting, independent woman for the time period, I thought she was manipulative and self-serving in her actions, never considering the repercussions of her actions on other people. She had a singlemindedness about her that was not admirable because of the way she went about getting what she wanted, while confessing God's leading & protection. Her bullying of her older brother came off as disrespectful & mean, which was disturbing. The story of her older sister in CA drug on endlessly with both husband & wife repeating the same litany of complaints, without trusting God or each other with their burdens. I got tired of reading about them. I did enjoy & respect Jordana's brother & their new friend, Caitlyn.

I thought the pacing was uneven, and sluggish for the most part.  The characters were fairly engaging,  but I felt that none of them were really well developed.  All seemed to have major trouble with communicating their needs and feelings.  There were multiple plot lines and NONE were fully resolved at the conclusion of this novel.

A letter to Brenton and Jordana Baldwin (brother and sister, who's parents are in Russia for an extended work related stay) lets them know she will be arriving by ship soon to NYC, where they live. This was such a surprise, but they soon become fast friends, even though the difference in their social status is huge. It makes no difference to the wealthy brother and sister, but Caitlan, of the very poor working class feels the difference and will not take their offerings of lodging, so sets out to work as a chamber maid at another home. Eventually they all set off for a trek across America to find her brother in California. Now, mind you, it's during the Civil war and the three of them are 19, 16, and 18. Yikes. So that's the first story, the three young folk making their way through cities on trains with Brenton's photography gear, until there are no more rails, where at that point a wagon and horses are purchased to make their way across the plains and mountains, um, alone. Again, yikes."

The plot treats the reader to a look inside the home of the Vanderbilts and high New York Society and the challenges and thrills of traveling West in wartime.

We are introduced to the Baldwin family and their adventures in the building of the West in connection with the transpacific railroad.  In this book we learn to love each of the members of the Baldwin family as well as their extended family.  The female protagonist that stands out for me is Jordana.  We see her emerge from an adolescent into a woman.  The authors did a superb job in her character development.  I like the way they used the literary tool of foreshadowing to building the plot line rising action.  For example, when discussing Victoria’s life (the eldest of the Baldwin siblings) in California there is references to the Donner Pass.  Needless to say, if you are a history buff you are aware of the significance of the Donner Pass and the Donner Party.  Tapping into this knowledge makes the reader curious if Victoria’s husband gets caught in this situation.  This is an excellent example of the authors’ writing skills in keeping and maintaining the reader’s interest.  In addition, the author’s end the story at the correct point as now the reader wants to read more about each of these strong and determined characters.  You can’t help but root for their success but you are left with a big question as to what happens next.  Well done."

Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."

As long as you like American history, you will like this. The book takes a small slice of history and tells it almost novelistically. You can see the ruddy cheeks, mahogany paneling, feel the orations of Daniel Webster, learn about his expertise in politics, his high fees, and his decline. I remember so many cases from American History of yore that were fully explicated here - the Dartmouth College case - e.g. - and that I didn't quite get in high school or college. The book starts at Jamestown, and you learn of the horrors of that colony, which was a corporation, as was Plymouth Bay to the north. One learns about the precise reasons for the Boston Tea Party, not just the flaccid story of the courageous revolutionaries. Winkler tells us that all of the civil rights laws started with the rights of corporations, not people and that the first two - Dred Scott and a woman's right to be a lawyer - failed."

The 14th Amendment  (along with the 13th and 15th) was written to integrate freed slaves legally into society, was usurped by the corporations to not be considered organizations but a gathering of people. The last remaining drafter of the 14th Amendment lied to convince the Supremes that Corporations were part of the definition of ""persons as stated in the Amendment. A study done shows in a 30 year period some 300 14 Amendment cases were brought before the Supreme Court. Of those only 25 were race related in which was voted down every time (included I assume the infamous ""Pleussy""). The rest were Corporate right's related which the corporations won every time."

In the course of our history which was founded on Corporatism (and slavery ) we have come to conflate legal personages with living, breathing, thinking, feeling beings. This book rolls out the way that has evolved. It constantly reminds us of key decisions along the way.

But it gives a very full history of key court cases that framed constitutional rights of corporations and the litigants and justices who paved the way for the world we currently live in.  If one wants to understand how corporate capitalism has come to pervade so much of politics in America, one must read this book.  It illuminates the issue and gives the landmark cases that have enabled the current system."
956,0,0.05602918586789555,"The author is a UCLA law professor and the book is very much a legal history which focuses on the cases which enabled corporate rights in America.  The author starts with the founding of the nation and some inherited perspectives on corporate rights inherited from English Law.  Early cases, before the complete proliferation of limited liability companies were for example, the Dartmouth College vs Woodward.  The author discusses ideas like the rights of chartered companies to be exempt from state meddling and the first company which really had to face such an issue was the Bank of the United States.  Early corporate disputes centered more around states rights to regulate vs corporate rights to engage in business on their own terms.  The author discusses how the turning point in the ideas of the breath of corporate rights came after the Civil War and the 14th amendment.  As absurd as it is, the granting of equal rights in constitutional terms suddenly turned into a cry for equality for corporations despite not being persons of any tangible form.  The author highlights the central arguments for corporate rights were constructed around the reality that corporations are funded by people who's rights should flow the corporations.  On the rebutting side was always the argument that corporations are set up to limit liability to the individual, are social constructions, and are not entitled to equal treatment.  The examples of this are discussed in multiple landmark cases where criminal liability became an issue and questions of obligations of directors.  Throughout corporate history in the US after the civil war, these ideas continued to cycle back and forth depending on the temperature of the Supreme Court.  It is quite interesting and things like funding of campaigns is a matter that has rich history the ignited concerns at the turn of the century.  The issues we face today rhyme with the past."
957,0,0.10799999999999998,"The author gives the full history of corporate rights and how the constitutional rights in a post civil war world were twisted into rights for corporations.  Subsequent to that, the exact meaning of that interpretation became central to many cases of the next 150 years.  This culminated with Citizens United and the free speech rights for corporations.  Onlookers into American society would find much of this completely ridiculous but nonetheless the libertarian corporate capitalist streak of the country has solidified the rights of corporations after many battles over the last 2 centuries.  It will take a long time and much effort to partially reverse such decisions and there is strong evidence recent cases are more judicial activism than what is normal.  If one wants to understand some of the subtleties and history of corporate lobbying for its rights in America, one must read this book."

While it's  listed under ""Law"", it is also a historical account about the role of corporations from the first days of our republic. The author, Adam Winkler, is a Professor of Law at UCLA and contributes to top national papers.  It's substantive and well written with excellent narrative flow.  I was appalled at the Citizens United ruling and thought it was outrageous, but I am looking forward to getting the historical context as to how this notion, now law, came about."

This isn't Winkler's fault--he writes clearly and doesn't burden the text with a lot of jargon.  The subject matter is complex and needs this kind of discussion.  Bottom line:  if you haven't read this book, keep your mouth shut on Citizens United because you don't know nothing.  This is a book of considerable significance.

This book is full of the newest research and applications for the classroom. It hits on interdisciplinary levels, such as social emotional learning, and the fixed/growth mindset. This book would be great to give anyone you know who has developed learned helplessness or chronic stress over time - regardless of whether they are an educator or student.

965,0,0.14761904761904762,"There is currently a great renewal of interest in promoting Social Emotional Learning (“SEL”) in our schools, together with recognition that mindfulness based approaches could form an important component of approaches geared towards development of social-emotional skills.  Research shows that we have a greater need than ever for schools to address the nonacademic needs of students, as statistically significant minorities of school aged children have statistically significant emotional/behavioral vulnerabilities and lack of academic readiness.  (Jennings P., Lantieri, L, & Roeser, R., 2012, p. 372).  There are two main avenues through which this can be accomplished:  (1) creating a curriculum that promotes mindfulness (and SEL) through inquiry-based, collaborative, experiential learning (as already done in certain private schools, e.g., Montessori and Reggio Emilia); and (2) instructing teachers and students in the regular use of mindfulness based practices, preferably as part of an organization-wide or state-wide SEL program."

One such book is Mindful Learning, written by two professors at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, Drs. Craig Hassed and Richard Chambers.  This book would be an excellent first read for educators who would like to learn about the science behind, and benefits of, mindfulness practices.  The book is scaffolded in a way that allows for clear understanding of the potential positive relationship between mindfulness and the mental qualities necessary for efficient learning.  The reach of the book is broad, ranging from the science supporting the use of mindfulness based interventions, to the mental skill sets needed for effective learning, to actual practices that educators may use to develop a mindfulness practice."

The authors offer a caveat: “(u)sing acceptance to make something go away is actually nonacceptance masquerading as acceptance…”  What is helpful here is remembering the impermanence of all things, that this too shall pass. Also, we should refrain from “shooting the second arrow”, that is, letting go of any judgment of the thought, idea, feeling, or sensation as “bad” or “wrong”.  Although this may sound, it is not easy – because sometimes what arises is difficult or painful or even intolerable.  (Id., p. 16)."
971,0,-0.0625,"• Present Moment: “The present moment is the only moment that has any legitimate claim to reality.  The past and future are just ideas.  The past and future never actually exist…” (Id., p. 17)."
972,0,0.06041666666666666,"At the beginning of Mindful Learning, the authors discuss the need for a pedagogical shift to an inquiry based approach to education, i.e., the dialectic approach, as opposed to the traditional public school approach where the teachers are providing knowledge and the student absorbs it (without much reflection or personal connection).  There is recognition of the importance that students maintain a childlike fascination with the subject matter.  The question is posed, how do we keep children interested, and not destroy their naturally inquisitive spirit, ending up like a “snuffed out candle”? (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 3, quoting Einstein)."
973,0,0.1875," “Einstein felt that real discovery was an intuitive process.  Intuition…comes from the Latin word intueri, meaning “to look upon, consider, contemplate.”  It is not “an unconscious, unreflecting, conditioned, or automatic way of seeing things.  It is all about being conscious and aware.  If we really look we have a chance of understanding, because what is within us is connecting with what we are observing.  Thus connectedness, or unity, goes hand in hand with learning mindfully.”  (Ibid.)."
974,0,0.2150669642857143,"After this beginning, there is very little in the book that discusses changing the pedagogy of schools; rather the primary focus is on educating teachers so that they may be mindful models of educational leadership in the classroom.  Developing mindfulness in teachers is viewed as an issue of primary importance  by the authors: “Education (on mindfulness) needs to take place at a number of levels, starting with the training of quality mindfulness teachers.” (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 179).  Thus, Mindful Learning focuses to a large extent on bringing mindfulness into the classroom through teachers who have developed their own mindfulness practices, as well as through scripted mindfulness exercises to be practiced with students, which may be found in Chapter 20."
975,0,0.18750000000000006,"Much of the book is devoted to presenting evidence of why engaging in mindfulness is a beneficial practice for teachers and students.  However,  they do recognize the indispensable truth that “(m)indfulness can only be offered; the choice is always the person’s own as to whether they will take up the gift.” (Id., p. 145).  “Mindfulness cannot be imposed on students.  They will need a level of motivation and insight in order to engage with the process.  Otherwise they will just pretend to go through the motions to keep the teacher happy, or – even worse – they will build up resistance and resentment to mindfulness, an attitude that might be difficult to shift.” (p. 144)."
976,0,0.25,"The authors call for a type of “applied mindfulness” which departs from traditional mindfulness practice by its results driven focus of attaining specific goals, such as stress reduction and performance enhancement.  In contrast, mindfulness as developed from ancient Buddhist philosophy has at its core the purpose of achieving enduring happiness and gaining insight into the true nature of existence (impermanent, unreliable, and non-self). (Boddhi, 1999).  The authors state that, instead of teaching mindfulness and “letting students figure out on their own how to apply it,” they teach mindfulness with the stated goals of managing stress, improving study performance (by learning to sustain attention and focus over a period of time), developing presence of mind rather than trying to multitask , and overcoming procrastination. (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 48)."
977,0,0.20083333333333334,"The definition of mindfulness in Mindful Learning is a “mental discipline aimed at training attention” (Id., p. 6).  In this reader’s opinion, this definition omits the true purpose of mindfulness as a path for transformation, that involves development of wisdom, intuition and discernment, liberation from suffering, and inner growth of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (the brahmaviharas). The concern here is that mindfulness could end up becoming a tool to enable students to be calm and compliant with a dull curriculum, rather than following a path paved with curiosity and kindness, with an aim of inner transformation."
978,0,0.16249999999999998,"Drs. Hassed and Chambers believe that applied mindfulness is justified by the results:  that hooking students and teachers into trying mindfulness (as a secular practice that enhances performance and reduces stress) will allow them to experience mindfulness.  The viewpoint is that once people begin practicing mindfulness, they will understand on an experiential level the benefits of such a practice, and then begin to apply it more broadly in their lives, that is, generalize mindfulness to other areas of their lives.  The concept of “applied mindfulness” will likely appeal to many within the public education system, with its focus on measurable results in attainment of educational skills.  However, this view of mindfulness arguably omits the heart of mindfulness:  which is to wake up to whatever is, in the present moment, and to allow what is there to just be, with loving-kindness and gentle curiosity.  A question that arises is, if the practice of “applied mindfulness” is results-driven and goal-oriented, is it still mindfulness?"
979,0,0.39999999999999997,"However, it is understood that our public education system is mandated, to the extent possible, to use secular methodologies shown to be effective by scientific research which will enable students to make measurable progress in skill acquisition.  Perhaps what we need are some additional goals in education, which incorporate skills which are not so measurable, such as kindness, empathy, and joy in learning?  Our society is so results driven, can we allow space for these priceless capacities to arise?"
980,0,0.1934343434343434,"Putting aside the issue of “applied mindfulness,” there are many positive aspects to this book.  For instance, the discussion of mindfulness and attention in the early part of the book is spot on.  The authors discuss how we are often not even aware of where our attention is, and that noticing what our attention is focused upon is the first step in developing mindfulness.  “Mindfulness is not a distraction from our worries.”  (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 9).  “Mindfulness meditation is…not a method of tuning out but rather of tuning in…..” (Id., p. 11).  “We cannot stop the mind from thinking” . . . . . but we can “learn to be less reactive to it or involved in it.” (Id., p. 10)."
981,0,0.16206060606060607,"One of the main thrusts of this book is the positive impact of mindfulness upon executive functioning skills, which are high level functions of the brain’s prefrontal cortex important for learning.  “Research shows that practicing mindfulness activates many of the same brain areas as those that are active when we are engaged in executive functioning…….particularly attention, short-term memory, regulating emotional impulses, planning, and mental flexibility.”  (Id., p. 24).  Strengthening these capacities is one of the primary purposes for the use of “applied mindfulness” according to the authors."

As  Dr. Dan Siegel often says, “neurons that fire together, wire together”.  Thus, the more we practice “unmindfulness”, the more we will reap the “costs” listed above.  Research has shown that mindfulness can “ literally shape our brain in ways that make it much easier to concentrate, remember and learn, regulate emotions and behaviors, reason and think abstractly.” (Id., p. 32)."
995,0,0.145,"In furtherance of cultivating mindfulness within the teaching environment, the authors suggest creating a mindful physical environment, regular practices of self-care, and a teaching style that is calm and enthusiastic, encouraging openness, and which uses mindfulness practices in the classroom.  The authors do recognize the importance of teaching mindfulness not as “a separate skill divorced from other aspects of the curriculum” but rather as something that is “integrated with other content.” (Id., p. 141).

Thankfully, the authors do fully recognize that such change does not happen overnight. (Id., p. 167)."
1013,0,0.0,Conclusion:
1014,0,0.09702380952380953,"Mindful Learning covers a large range of territory, and has sufficient depth for an educator’s first introduction to Mindfulness.  The book is carefully written to avoid any religious, philosophical, or spiritual overtones, which might cause discomfort in the educational setting. The focus on the brain-based (or cognitive) aspects of mindfulness (e.g., improving executive functioning skills such as attention and working memory) give the book a solid grounding in educational science.  The practices included in the back of the book are well scripted, and useful.  While the book does not discuss needed changes in state-wide or school district-wide pedagogy to bring mindfulness into the mainstream of education, it does address some of the challenges associated with organizational change."
1015,0,0.18333333333333335,"One concern that arose is the potential effect of divorcing of mindfulness from grounding in ethics (such as the Noble Eightfold Path), loving-kindness, ethical/moral values, or spiritual principles.  This book contains William James’ oft-quoted statement on “the importance of being able to focus attention as the ultimate education.” (Id., p. 5).  However, mindfulness is not just about the focusing of attention, but also about the attitude that we cultivate towards what we pay attention to, and how we act in response to what arises."
1016,0,0.4833333333333334," While this book has omitted what many consider to be the true purposes of mindfulness: a path for transformation, liberation from suffering, wisdom, development of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity (the brahmaviharas), that may well have been intentional, in order to make delivery of the message of mindfulness more palatable to those within the educational system."
1017,0,0.12727272727272726," It is encouraging that books such as Mindful Learning have arrived on the educational scene, which are helping to breathe new life into the movement to bring mindfulness-based approaches, which are consistent with social-emotional learning principles, into the realm of public education."

1060,0,0.11574074074074074,"It had been only a few days since the end of the school year.  I stared down at the book titled Mindful Learning, written by Dr. Craig Hassed and Dr. Richard Chambers, mindfulness consultants at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  The cover, which looks like a chalkboard, triggered a flood of memories from the classroom.  Was I ready to read my first full-fledged mindfulness in education book for the summer?"
1061,0,0.1130952380952381,"After a week or two of mindful waiting, I started reading, not knowing exactly what to expect.  I had chosen to read this book because it has been marketed toward people who work with high-school age children and above.  Other related books - “The Way of Mindful Education”, “Teach, Breathe, Learn”, and “Mindfulness for Teachers” – I read while teaching middle school.  Now that I had moved onto teaching older students, it seemed appropriate to explore a resource targeting this age group."
1062,0,-0.08525641025641026,"True to the Aussie way of being, Hassed and Chambers adopt a casual tone, even when delving into complex topics such as neuroscience.  Throughout the book, they use the pronouns “we” and “us”, referring to the wider community as well as to themselves.  They also use brevity to their benefit, using the least possible words that still relay their thoughts. But blink and you might miss a transition, giving a feeling of abrupt turns.  Look closely and you’ll see how carefully they organized their book.  They begin by defining education and mindfulness before moving on to exploring mindfulness in student learning, which is the text’s main focus.  They then discuss mindfulness in creativity, sports, and relationships.  Later, the authors apply mindfulness to teachers, even laying out ways to work with those resistant to incorporating these practices into the classroom.  They follow by describing how mindfulness goes well beyond school walls.  For concluding thoughts, they briefly mention potential approaches that organizations can implement when incorporating mindfulness, along with common snafus they may face.  For takeaway tools, they include twelve sample exercises for teachers to try in or out of the classroom."
1063,0,0.2111111111111111,"Instead of beginning with a definition of mindfulness, Hassed and Chambers first invite us to pause by asking the question, “What is education?”  It has taken me years to fully arrive at their view of education as a holistic endeavor where teachers and students can learn from any situation – an endeavor where teachers facilitate or elicit existing insight through inquiry and questioning.  Mindfulness supports this perspective.  I read about this holistic approach while in graduate school for teaching and learning, but I didn’t understand or embody it until I went so fully away from this view and back again after almost leaving the profession entirely.  Why is it that so many teachers lose sight of teaching as drawing out from within?  I still grapple with this question, trying to balance my own views with the existing structures in the public school district where I teach.  From this searching perspective, I fully appreciated the authors’ note - “The journey to becoming a mindful teacher and learner is a lifelong project” (2014, p.4)."
1064,0,0.18579545454545454,"In our fast-paced world, mindfulness can appear counter-intuitive.  Instead of pausing to navel gaze, shouldn’t we be doing more to get ahead?  Hassed and Chambers efficiently and thoroughly address the misconception that mindfulness meditation is about stopping and clearing one’s thoughts.  They explain how it is more of a process of awareness and release from the grips of thinking, giving away our attachments to our thoughts.  They don’t contribute anything new to the existing foundational knowledge of mindfulness.  Rather, they organize information into a secular, digest-able fashion, using vignettes from the school setting.  Then, to boost our confidence and conviction about the importance of mindfulness in a world of skepticism, they ground us in the dominant language of science.  Explaining clearly how mindfulness practices can shape our brains to improve concentration, memorization, emotional regulation, reasoning, and abstract thinking, they convince even a skeptic to explore the potential of mindfulness to enhance (and even transform) our educational, recreational, and personal lives."
1065,0,0.14372294372294372,"Hassed and Chambers’ find a niche in their attention to the effects of mindfulness on stress, focus, and performance in older students.  Like many others, I used to think that we need a certain bit of stress in order to perform better.  However, the authors illustrate how we can perform from a mindful state of calm and confidence, free from stress.  It’s worth looking up the Hassed mindfulness-based stress-performance graph to rethink your view on stress.  They convinced me that mindfulness is a valuable skill, mindset, and way of being that helps us reduce stress and enhance attention.  If you aren’t convinced by their graph, read their chapter on why attention matters – the costs of unmindfulness.  Wasting time, not understanding things, poor emotional well-being, and not enjoying life are just some of the outcomes of living in the dark."
1066,0,0.16833333333333333,"What struck me about Hassed and Chambers is how intentional they are with their use of mindfulness in education.  Instead of leaving the effects of mindfulness on student learning up to chance, they have specifically created a program, Mindfulness for Academic Success (MAS), to apply mindfulness to studying.  This program came out of their personal realizations that people more easily comprehend mindfulness when the focus is more explicit.  They share a few exercises to give us a taste of MAS.  I tried out their study meditation where students work on a written task while noting any mental distractions on one side of the paper.  Experientially, I understood their intention of helping students fully acknowledge and accept distractions in order to fully let go of them.  This was my first encounter with a program focused so directly on academic behavior – I wish I had enrolled in this program as an overwhelmed undergraduate."
1067,0,0.24529100529100528,"Their chapters on resilience, emotional development, and communication sometimes read like a self-help book, providing tips and explanations on how to practice mindfulness to promote these skills.  Although this tone can be perceived as superficial, it can also be construed as actually helpful in providing us with a broader view of what mindfulness can do for our students.  Hassed and Chambers even take the time to address creativity, movement, and relationships since school is not always just about academics; arts, athletics, and social events play a large part in many communities.  In addition, I found their chapter on eMindfulness – how paying attention helps us use media more wisely – timely and highly applicable for our ultra-connected young adults."
1068,0,0.19702380952380952,"I particularly enjoyed their roadmap for building mindfulness practices in children throughout the years, so that they do not fall into “mindfulness fatigue”.  Hassed and Chambers begin with Elementary School – Years 1-3: “simple mindfulness exercises to provide some quiet at the start and end of class” and end with College or University: “Teach how mindfulness applies to leadership, professional development, higher executive functioning, and self-care” (2014, p.142-143).  It is powerful to envision what mindfulness can look like if woven into long-term educational planning.  Of course, this roadmap is only an example of what can happen, as educators very well know the intricate complexities of planning and implementing curricula in large educational systems."
1069,0,-0.00535714285714285,"Lest you think Hassed and Chambers focus only on students, fear not.  They thoughtfully round out their mindfulness tour with a focus on the teacher.  As someone who has experienced almost all of the major barriers to teaching – burnout, stress, poor mental health, to name a few – it was cathartic to have someone put these difficulties into words and how mindfulness can help us to work through or around these so-called barriers."
1070,0,0.1778846153846154,"Just when you get the sense that something might be missing from their whole tour, Hassed and Chambers admit that the attention training aspect of mindfulness can seem a little cold by itself.  They broaden mindfulness beyond the classroom by noting how mindfulness can be equally thought of as heartfulness.  They write, “The word mindfulness implies ‘mind’ – which many people equate to the brain – and so risks obscuring what is most important about learning to be more awake, open, and loving in each moment of life” (2014, p. 162).  As I arrived at the end of the book, I sensed some warm and fuzzies, fully opening to the potential of mindfulness to transform our way of being in the world."
1071,0,0.21111111111111114,"Overall, I am filled with gratitude toward Hassed and Chambers for providing teachers, administrators, and parents with some clarity in our lifelong journeys to becoming mindful people and role models for our children.  I envision Mindful Learning as a useful resource for a school district or university interested in implementing mindfulness.  The text probably will appeal more-so to teachers of older students who are expected to study independently and become more aware of their learning habits, but the principles apply to every age level.  For a school district, it would be a great way for teachers to become more well-versed in what mindfulness actually is and how it can help.  The chapters can be used as stand-alone resources over a longer period of time, leaving plenty of room for discussion and dialogue.  After all, it is up to individuals and small groups to decide what to do with this valuable information."
1072,0,0.18181818181818182,"Keep in mind as you continue your exploration of mindfulness in education that there is a multitude of resources to drawn from.  To learn more about the unmindfulness, or mindlessness, check out Ellen Langer’s ""Mindfulness"" (1990).  Interested in the neurobiology of mindfulness?  Read Willoughby Britton and Arielle Sydnor’s “Neurobiological models of meditation practices: Implications for application with youth” (2015) in Chris Willard and Amy Saltzman’s “Teaching Mindfulness Skills to Kids and Teens”.  Amishi Jha also delves into the science behind mindfulness in her talk, “Improving Attention and Working Memory” (2012), which can be found on Vimeo.

However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
1092,0,0.06715686274509802,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."

The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."

This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
1095,0,0.2951111111111111,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet.

As long as you like American history, you will like this. The book takes a small slice of history and tells it almost novelistically. You can see the ruddy cheeks, mahogany paneling, feel the orations of Daniel Webster, learn about his expertise in politics, his high fees, and his decline. I remember so many cases from American History of yore that were fully explicated here - the Dartmouth College case - e.g. - and that I didn't quite get in high school or college. The book starts at Jamestown, and you learn of the horrors of that colony, which was a corporation, as was Plymouth Bay to the north. One learns about the precise reasons for the Boston Tea Party, not just the flaccid story of the courageous revolutionaries. Winkler tells us that all of the civil rights laws started with the rights of corporations, not people and that the first two - Dred Scott and a woman's right to be a lawyer - failed."

The 14th Amendment  (along with the 13th and 15th) was written to integrate freed slaves legally into society, was usurped by the corporations to not be considered organizations but a gathering of people. The last remaining drafter of the 14th Amendment lied to convince the Supremes that Corporations were part of the definition of ""persons as stated in the Amendment. A study done shows in a 30 year period some 300 14 Amendment cases were brought before the Supreme Court.

In the course of our history which was founded on Corporatism (and slavery ) we have come to conflate legal personages with living, breathing, thinking, feeling beings. This book rolls out the way that has evolved. It constantly reminds us of key decisions along the way.

1106,0,0.05602918586789555,"The author is a UCLA law professor and the book is very much a legal history which focuses on the cases which enabled corporate rights in America.  The author starts with the founding of the nation and some inherited perspectives on corporate rights inherited from English Law.  Early cases, before the complete proliferation of limited liability companies were for example, the Dartmouth College vs Woodward.  The author discusses ideas like the rights of chartered companies to be exempt from state meddling and the first company which really had to face such an issue was the Bank of the United States.  Early corporate disputes centered more around states rights to regulate vs corporate rights to engage in business on their own terms.  The author discusses how the turning point in the ideas of the breath of corporate rights came after the Civil War and the 14th amendment.  As absurd as it is, the granting of equal rights in constitutional terms suddenly turned into a cry for equality for corporations despite not being persons of any tangible form.  The author highlights the central arguments for corporate rights were constructed around the reality that corporations are funded by people who's rights should flow the corporations.  On the rebutting side was always the argument that corporations are set up to limit liability to the individual, are social constructions, and are not entitled to equal treatment.  The examples of this are discussed in multiple landmark cases where criminal liability became an issue and questions of obligations of directors.  Throughout corporate history in the US after the civil war, these ideas continued to cycle back and forth depending on the temperature of the Supreme Court.  It is quite interesting and things like funding of campaigns is a matter that has rich history the ignited concerns at the turn of the century.  The issues we face today rhyme with the past."

Subsequent to that, the exact meaning of that interpretation became central to many cases of the next 150 years.  This culminated with Citizens United and the free speech rights for corporations.  Onlookers into American society would find much of this completely ridiculous but nonetheless the libertarian corporate capitalist streak of the country has solidified the rights of corporations after many battles over the last 2 centuries.  It will take a long time and much effort to partially reverse such decisions and there is strong evidence recent cases are more judicial activism than what is normal.  If one wants to understand some of the subtleties and history of corporate lobbying for its rights in America, one must read this book."

The author, Adam Winkler, is a Professor of Law at UCLA and contributes to top national papers.  It's substantive and well written with excellent narrative flow.

This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call ""plot.""  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.

1161,0,0.13922488038277508,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading ""Twilight"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng."

Unfortunately, I hadn't ever owned the complete series; I read them either through libraries, online or from friends. Having them all in one place where I can burn all my money in one go and re-read them again and again and again is the perfect gift to myself.  I'm not usually a fan of movie tie-in editions, but here it isn't distracting since it still features original covers (not movie stills).  You just have to see Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey's name on the box.  Overall if you've never owned the complete set then this is a fantastic investment.

Instead of finding Jordana to be an exciting, independent woman for the time period, I thought she was manipulative and self-serving in her actions, never considering the repercussions of her actions on other people. She had a singlemindedness about her that was not admirable because of the way she went about getting what she wanted, while confessing God's leading & protection. Her bullying of her older brother came off as disrespectful & mean, which was disturbing. The story of her older sister in CA drug on endlessly with both husband & wife repeating the same litany of complaints, without trusting God or each other with their burdens.

I thought the pacing was uneven, and sluggish for the most part.  The characters were fairly engaging,  but I felt that none of them were really well developed.  All seemed to have major trouble with communicating their needs and feelings.  There were multiple plot lines and NONE were fully resolved at the conclusion of this novel.

This was such a surprise, but they soon become fast friends, even though the difference in their social status is huge. It makes no difference to the wealthy brother and sister, but Caitlan, of the very poor working class feels the difference and will not take their offerings of lodging, so sets out to work as a chamber maid at another home. Eventually they all set off for a trek across America to find her brother in California. Now, mind you, it's during the Civil war and the three of them are 19, 16, and 18. Yikes. So that's the first story, the three young folk making their way through cities on trains with Brenton's photography gear, until there are no more rails, where at that point a wagon and horses are purchased to make their way across the plains and mountains, um, alone.

The plot treats the reader to a look inside the home of the Vanderbilts and high New York Society and the challenges and thrills of traveling West in wartime.

We are introduced to the Baldwin family and their adventures in the building of the West in connection with the transpacific railroad.  In this book we learn to love each of the members of the Baldwin family as well as their extended family.  The female protagonist that stands out for me is Jordana.  We see her emerge from an adolescent into a woman.  The authors did a superb job in her character development.  I like the way they used the literary tool of foreshadowing to building the plot line rising action.  For example, when discussing Victoria’s life (the eldest of the Baldwin siblings) in California there is references to the Donner Pass.  Needless to say, if you are a history buff you are aware of the significance of the Donner Pass and the Donner Party.  Tapping into this knowledge makes the reader curious if Victoria’s husband gets caught in this situation.  This is an excellent example of the authors’ writing skills in keeping and maintaining the reader’s interest.  In addition, the author’s end the story at the correct point as now the reader wants to read more about each of these strong and determined characters.  You can’t help but root for their success but you are left with a big question as to what happens next.  Well done."

1275,0,0.23833333333333337,"I have been reading a great deal of Urban Fantasy, and I was very much up for a change of pace. This really hit the spot, as they say. I felt like the characters were cohesive, complex and shown to the reader from enough angles to make them feel alive and real. While they all spoke in the flowery speech considered polite, it was easy to tell their personalities from their particular speech habits. I am often cut-throat in my reviews about dialogue so it's refreshing to be able to compliment, not critique it in a review."
1276,0,0.469,"The best thing about this book was not the plot -- because this is a fairly old work the plot has many of the tropes we readers come to expect from this sort of work. They may seem cliched now because so many newer works have aped them. However, the descriptions are astounding -- detailed and precise yet not overlong or exhausting. It always maintains the perfect level to engross and trap the reader but not bore them. The 'movie' in my head was awash with wonderful detail, lush backgrounds and perfect costumes. I really haven't read description this good in a very long time."
1277,0,0.27999999999999997,"However, the one thing I didn't care for was the three or four incidents of anachronism stew. Xifeng had a wrist watch centuries before they came into fashion, Baochai had a few too many modernisms in her speech and  the Chinese manners of gift-giving were ignored, possibly to make the work more appropriate for a western audience. If these had not stuck out of the narratives like sudden blotches of bright paint on a somber renaissance portrait, this would have been five stars. UPDATE -- the author has taken the time to address this paragraph in the comments. Please read her replies as they explain a great deal."

In the front of the book they give a geneology map...you've got to be kidding...no way to keep track....just keep on reading.  It does give a great description of the class system, the mores, and the discrimination that was present. However...I found it to be  an exhausting book to read  and I lost interest in the characters"

I will not soon forget this wonderful novel. I am so glad that this author re-wrote this historical novel and made it simpler for the present readers. it must have been a difficult undertaking and I can see from Pauline Chen's impressive degrees that she truly was in a position to write such an intelligent book. Please write more!!!"
1282,0,0.24659090909090908,I consider this story a fan fiction based on the original rather than a abridged version of the original considering the number of characters the author either kills off at the beginning or allowed to live till the end.
1283,0,-0.22083333333333333,The bad: It is written in present tense. Why did the author do this? It makes reading it more awkward. Four stars if it had not been written in present tense. Seems common for debut authors for some reason.
1284,0,0.21349999999999997,"The good: It's an interesting, easy to read version of a very long plodding confusing classic. Her version of the ending is mostly believable (except the epilogue!) and the characters are well drawn if perhaps seemingly a bit different from the original."

The closed world of a family in standing within the classical world of its Emporors, feels like a peeping with Daiyu into a secret world.  I am intrigued with the linked lives of the women of this world and how they live out their lives often within a few rooms.

1291,0,0.08492063492063491,"I have never read Dream of the Red Chamber but decided to pick up this novel as a condensed version of the aforementioned.  Pauline Chen's The Red Chamber is a captivating read from the get-go, especially in that it provides the right balance of historical context while not detracting from the depths of the main characters.  Some may be unhappy at the changes that have been made in this novel, but if it's taken as a separated, individual novel rather than a reworking of the classic, it will prove to be an enjoyable read.  I was caught up in the novel to the point that I was in tears by the end."

Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English.
