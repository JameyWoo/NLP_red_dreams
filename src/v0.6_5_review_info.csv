1,0,"Simple story of an ambitious Bengali girl seemingly stuck in the confines of traditional Bengali female role. The relationships are portrayed authentically and with compassion for all involved. Great introduction to microfinance for young readers. Our girls whipped through it quickly, but enjoyed the ride."
2,0,This book is a great early reader.  I am an elementary school librarian and I'm always looking for books that expose my students to cultures around the world.  The book is not long and tell the story of a young girl that wants to help her family financially.  She uses her talents to find a way to accomplish that.
3,0,The book would also be a great read aloud for grades 2-3.  Great descriptions and character development for such a short book.
4,0,This is a fun and engaging story.  Your kids will love it.
5,0,"You might love it, too.  This is a subtle and heart warming story of women's empowerment.  Without an angry word, or a whiff of ideology, this story tells what poor families can do by enlisting the gifts of all their members.  These women don't wait for someone to act for them, but take risks. And everyone wins--there is no zero sum game here."
6,0,"But my imagination is soaring--this is a kid's story, and you'll just have to enjoy it on that level!"
7,0,I purchased this book as I looked for international books for 8-11 year olds. This book does a good job of showing the culture. The end notes are also interesting. I believe this is an enjoyable way to learn about another culture.
8,0,My daughter really liked this story. She's studying India right now for her 5th grade homeschool curriculum and this was one of the fiction books we chose to start the section off. She was very engaged in the story but it was was too easy for her reading level. She read it in about 30 minutes but really enjoyed that 30 minutes!
9,0,"This was an authentic, heartfelt story to open the eyes of my children of what daily life, culture, and communication as well as relationships look like in another place, Bangladesh. I think we'll read it more than once!"
10,0,Inspiring story about a young girl who overcomes her troubles and situation with diligence and a fighting spirit.
11,0,"Every little girl should read this book or have it read to them. The illustrations are gorgeous, and the story is really empowering. I think I've bought this book at least 5 times, and give it out to my friends' daughters when they are old enough to start understanding the story. It's also a wonderful way for children to learn about a culture outside of the US (or wherever you live)."
12,0,"This book gently introduces kids to gender inequalities in some parts of the world. The characters are engaging and easy to like. At the same time, the problems they encounter provoke the reader into thinking about how girls are treated and how they SHOULD be treated. I'm looking forward to reading it to my students and getting their reaction."
13,0,This is a nice  and well-written story for young folks that has a lesson in it for all who read it
14,0,Lao She's brilliant but painful work is made thoroughly and accurately accessible to English speakers with this excellent translation.
15,0,"It's a tough read as we watch Xiangzi fall into one disaster after another, coupled with some tragically bad decisions on his own part. But the pain reveals much about the reality of those who are trapped economically and can't find a reliable path to prosperity in spite of bitterly hard work. However, I think Lao She has embedded a message of hope within the despair, as there were lucky things that came to Xiangzi (his name means lucky) and even the hope of the key blessing that could have transformed him and that neighbor girl,  Fuzi (the Fu means blessing or fortune in the Chinese). Had he accepted and held onto the gifts he was given, had he been a little more patient or a little more wise, and especially had he been a little less selfish, there was greater hope all along, in spite of the injustices inflicted by others. Perhaps or perhaps not---in any case, it's a much deeper book than some might think and one worthy of much reflection."
16,0,Lao She is one of China's great writers and one of the greats in world literature. This book deserves to be read by much wider audiences.
17,0,"Lao can be considered one of the great writers of modern China. His witty, thoughtful and inspiring look at the life of a rickshaw driver at the turn of the 20th century offers critical insight into why the Chinese Revolution happened as well as insight into how the poor perceive their own oppression, Lao's characters are charming, well written and his plot explores the everyday life of the Chinese people."
18,0,Overall I found this to be an interesting book
19,0,"This is a classic of Chinese literature. It tells the story of Hsiang Tzu, who aspires to own a rickshaw and the very hard work and planning it takes to purchase one.. Set in Peking during the 1930s, it captures the physical, cultural, and political environment of that period. This is a sad, enlightening, memorable book."
20,0,"Both a great thought piece and a great Chinese culture read. I think part of this mindset is visible in Chinese adults today, and the ending gave me a lot of thoughts to digest"
21,0,Liked the storyline. Very realistic for the time it was written. There were a lot of stereotypical Chinese stories around that time.

56,0,"China, vast and confusing, a population too large to count, a history older than time, it is impossible find enough space or time to work it all out. This book takes us on a journey through China's recent history through the eyes of one man. It isn't a happy journey; a difficult life at a difficult time but where this book helps is that it gives you just enough of a view of China to hold it in your head, a snapshot. This translation is both easy to read, and digest, not getting in the way of the story. There are some wry observations of the political system and an insight in to how things work. The social commentary on corruption and failings in both the system and the people in it sits within the narrative of one man’s life, a quest for knowledge and a struggle to simply exist. The fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Manchu Restoration and the birth of the Republic, all are shown to make very little difference to the author, life was hard, and the revolution made it no easier for him. Although it's clear that he found the revolution created opportunities for some, at the expense of others. Providing more ways not only to make money but also to spend it. Our journey ends in a different China to where it began with the simple life of an apprentice in the art of paper craft to a world-weary policeman. China remains fascinating and a somewhat elusive place. In the end, the lesson is ""Don't care too much"""

71,0,"As a Chinese reader, I have always adored the Chinese Dickens, Lao She. This book adds new knowledge about him, which sheds light on the fact that he was a global writer."
72,0,This book was published in 1999 and contained 16 works by Lao She. There were 15 short stories and 1 essay.
73,0,"Lao She (1899-1966) has been called one of China's best modern writers. He's known for the novel Rickshaw (1936, also called Camel Xiangzi and Rickshaw Boy) and the play Teahouse (1957), among other works. He's also remembered for his insightful short stories, many of which contained humor and featured the townspeople of Beijing, where he was born and grew up. He was of Sinicized Manchu heritage."
74,0,"Based on information provided by the co-translator of this work and an essay included by Lao She himself, it appeared that Lao began writing short stories around the early/mid-1920s and had published several large collections by the mid-1930s. After full-scale war with Japan broke out in July 1937, much of his work was written in support of China's war effort. Of his work after 1949, a compiler of another anthology has noted that it was written ""in the Marxist style."" So perhaps Lao's best--most literary--stories were from the period before the outbreak of war in 1937. In any case, all but one of the works in the present anthology were taken from collections between 1933 and mid-1937. The one later story was from 1943 and depicted a grasping art collector who became a collaborator."
75,0,"For this reader, the two outstanding stories in the collection were ""An Old and Established Name,"" a narrator's description of the decline of a store that couldn't adapt to the times, and ""Neighbors,"" a depiction of a escalating squabble between householders. Both showed insight into human nature and were funny and sad at once. ""A Grand Opening,"" about cynical men running a hospital for profit, was also darkly funny, though it felt as if the writer's good nature left him unable to come up with a suitably grim ending."
76,0,"Not all the stories were humorous. ""Rabbit"" showed the author's ability to depict an artist caught up in the world of Chinese opera and eventually devoured by it. ""Hot Dumplings"" was a memorable vignette about an unhappy couple, and ""Life Choices"" showed a poor couple with a baby and felt as if it might've been based on the author's own life. Lao's humorous stories, however, were by far the liveliest for this reader, as well as the most concisely written."
77,0,"Stories of other types included ""Autobiography of a Minor Character,"" which described at length the narrator's surroundings when he was growing up in Beijing, and ""Ding,"" which followed the thoughts of a boy visiting the seaside. The latter was called the author's only known experiment with the stream-of-consciousness technique and a very early example of it in modern Chinese fiction. The editor speculated that Lao might have been influenced in this regard by Dickens' use of the technique in David Copperfield, since Lao was a great admirer of Dickens, or might have been exposed to the literature of Joyce and Woolf while living in London in 1924-29."
78,0,"Another collection by Lao She is Crescent Moon and Other Stories, by Panda Books of China. ""Grandma Takes Charge,"" a good satirical tale by the author not included in Blades of Grass, appeared in Voices of Modern Asia and Treasury of Modern Asian Stories."
79,0,Some excerpts:
80,0,"""I remember our old neighbour, Young Qiu. By now the 'Young' Qiu of those days is naturally 'Old' Qiu. But even if I were to meet him now, even if he were already a hoary old man, I would still call him 'Young' Qiu. For me, he could never grow old. When we imagine flowers, what springs to mind are blooming red flowers and lush green leaves, not faded blooms that have lost their fragrance and are dropping their petals like rain. It was the same with Young Qiu. In people's minds, he was forever in the springtime of life, though he looked nothing like a flower."""
81,0,"""His face began to look like a dumpling that had split apart while boiling."""
82,0,"""Mrs. Ming was barbaric, and wrangling with a barbarian would demean one's social status. But his wife wasn't willing to let it go at that and insisted that he wreak some sort of vengeance on her behalf."""
83,0,"""The next day was Sunday. Mr. Yang was in the yard cleaning up his garden. Mr. Ming was inside his house repairing the windows. It seemed that the whole world was at peace, and mutual understanding had finally come to mankind."""
84,0,"""After I became a grown man, I once visited the Forbidden City. Red walls followed red walls, the great halls faced each other. Everywhere one ran into walls, and everywhere It was neat and orderly. It was stately and dignified, all right, but I really doubt that the crown prince had ever seen a pumpkin vine growing on a screen wall."""
85,0,"""Even though what we possessed didn't relieve us from our poverty, it did provide us that stability that made each blade of grass and each tree come alive in our hearts. At the very least, it made me a small blade of grass always securely rooted to its own turf. All that I am began here. My character was molded and cast here."""
86,0,Very interesting stories  with so much humor. One of my favorite book collections.
87,0,Enjoyed this one and it has enough of a variety to be a good book in my opinion.
88,0,"I got this hat for my 2.5 year old son, and it fits PERFECTLY! We are huge Broncos fans, so we got the one with the Broncos logo on it. I don’t know why, but I wasn’t expecting this hat to be as great as it is. My husband has a very similar one (adult sizes) that he got from the NFLshop website directly, and it is the same quality as this hat. I am very happy with this purchase, and you will be too!"
89,0,Fits kids 2 and 5. It's slightly large on the 2 year old and just fits the 5 year old (although her head is a bit on the larger side). Overall I probably woudn't get this for kids 6 or older as it probably won't fit.
90,0,The hat is well made and has the patriots logo on it. Good for boys and girls who love the patriots
91,0,"I bought this hat for my great-grandson - he is 4 and a half years old and is a Patriots fan like is grandfather.  He wears it all the time - hard to get it off his head even inside; however, he knows the rules and does remove it before going to the dinner table."
92,0,This was the perfect hat for my nephew who had a matching sweatshirt. It’s youth size so make sure you measure. Our sweet 10 year old was happy!
93,0,"I bought one each for both of my boys for Christmas. It is now April and I swear to you, they have not removed them from their heads for 4 months! They wear them every single day. They are super cute and good quality and the perfect size for my kiddos heads. My kids are 7 and 10 btw... for sizing purposes. These were a great purchase and I would recommend."

99,0,"Novelist and playwright Lao She's difficult life in China; his illustrious career there, in London and in New York; and his suicide by drowning in Beijing in 1966 were briefly described in Evan Osnos' recent book, ""Age of Ambition.""  An urge to learn more about Lao She prompted me to buy this bilingual volume of his best play, which includes a superb Introduction to his life and works."
100,0,"Although the People's Republic of China honored Lao She as a ""People's Artist"" and a ""Great Master of Language,"" fanatical Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution beat and humiliated him to the point of ultimate protest by suicide. The plot and dialogue of this drama display the same brave authenticity as his death.  Its three acts portray the social, economic, political and moral state of China during three generations:  (1) in 1898, near the end of the Qing or Manchu Dynasty; (2) in 1917, during the early years of the Republic of China; and (3) in 1945, after the Japanese occupation but before establishment of the Peoples Republic in 1949.  The eloquent, Brechtian orations of ""Oddball Yang"" that introduce each act are grouped in the single Appendix."
101,0,"This drama takes place in the the traditional, but evolving, Yutai Teahouse in Beijing, where we hear the voices of more than 60 characters as they appear and re-appear in the play.  Amid this diversity of lives over a span of 50 years, certain continuities are clear--poverty, corruption, and official notices on the teahouse walls, ""Don't discuss state affairs."""
102,0,"In addition to an arresting drama that evokes half a century of modern Chinese history, this bilingual edition )with English and simplified Hanzi characters on facing pages) is an excellent text for students of Chinese language, such as myself.  The Chinese characters are moderately large and very clear, the dialogue is eloquent, and the English translation is idiomatic.  Additional pinyin transcription could add to its excellence for students of Chinese language.  As it is, however, the book is a boon and a bargain!  I look forward to reading more work by Lao She and more volumes in this fine bilingual series of books by 20th Century Chinese writers."
103,0,An excellent view of China' tumult from a common man's  perspective. People just trying to live while the history we read about later is made.
104,0,"This volume provides the full text of Lao She's famous 1957 three-act play, ""Teahouse,"" in Chinese (regular characters) and a fluid English translation by John Howard-Gibbon.  The Chinese and English texts are presented on facing pages.  The volume includes an excellent review of Lao She's life and works by Kwok-kam Tan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  His review places the play in its historic and literary contexts, making this an excellent reference volume.  There's lively Beijing dialect, satire, meditations on the course of China's modernization from the time of the ""Self-Strengthening"" movement, and a tragic back story."
105,0,"""Lao She"" was the pen name of Shu Qingchun (1899-1966).  Set in China still governed by the Kuomintang after the end of the Second World War, ""Teahouse"" was written in 1957 during the Hundred Flowers movement.  Formally a satire of Chinese political movements before 1949 -- the last years of the Qing dynasty, the warlord years, and the Republic -- it was criticized during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and the Cultural Revolution.  In 1966, Lao She was seized and beaten by the Red Guards, and there are different accounts of his death -- that he was killed by the Red Guards, or committed suicide afterwards.  One of the characters in ""Teahouse"" asks the recurring question:  ""I love China, but who loves me?"""
106,0,-30-
107,0,"One of the strangest plays we can imagine because it deals with China and for us, westerners, China is the other end of the universe. It has three acts, one in 1898. The second ten years later hence in 1908 or so, and the third one after 1945 but under the Kuomintang government. The scene is in the Teahouse in Beijing all the time. At first we are at the end of the Imperial China with the Empire going out, meaning down, and the Emperor being pushed aside out of power. The reformist party takes over and in the second act we have the republican power. This will not change much at the end after the Japanese occupation and defeat when Beijing is under the control of the Kuomintang and the quasi occupation of the country by Americans. The hope everyone is waiting for (either as a frightful future for the Kuomintang officials, or some hope of decency among simple people) is coming from the western provinces and mountains and will take four years to arrive, but they will arrive indeed, the Communists."
108,0,"As for the historical change from 1898 to 1945 the play is not that original. But it is fascinating because it is tremendously Brechtian in the fact it concentrates on simple people and how they feel, react and simply suffer in front of change. Yet they have to endorse it because life is change. The main character is typical. Hardly 20 in 1898, taking over the Teahouse from his dead father he follows the trend and changes and he will change all along because nothing can be successful if it does not change."
109,0,"His point of view, his vision of successive periods of change and what they mean, including the shift from the older generation to the younger generation, at times twice removed, is sad, very sad. Change most of the time meant takeover, from the old proprietors, the old people, to the newcomers. In 1898 it meant getting rid of the Empire and its systematic selling and buying of girls and boys as anything at all and a plain banal practice, for the rich and the powerful who could buy a wife, when a eunuch, and even buy a son. Absurd world where a eunuch can buy himself a family, since he can’t make it himself, or shouldn’t I say “it”self. In 1908 it meant industrialization and the enthusiasm it may bring to the younger generation then who are able to sell all their property that brought no real enterprising benefits to open a factory. But that change did not go beyond this limited evolution and it required a lot of corruption and under the table or under the cover dealings."
110,0,"In 1945 the picture has changed. The Japanese had taken over and occupied the country for many years. They had purely seized all property that could produce anything and had integrated these requisitioned properties into their industrial endeavor whose only objective was the war with the USA. The Japanese were defeated and the Americans took over under the semblance of the Kuomintang. That meant transforming the Teahouse into a brothel more than anything else, with charming names on the ladies and the place, for the sole entertaining of the powerful of the Kuomintang and the occupying Americans and their puppets. All those opposed were either sent to prison or beaten up. A teachers’ strike is declared a rebellion and repressed in blood and violence. The ringleaders, as they are called are simply killed on the spot when captured, in the most effective and rapid way possible."
111,0,"All those who are against this evolution which is no reform but the continuation of the Japanese endeavor under the star-spangled banner and their local lackeys, their hope is the communists in the western mountains. And to symbolize how dead this old new world is, the younger man who was taking over the Teahouse after the death of his father in 1898 just hang himself before his Teahouse is seized by the Kuomintang and he himself is reduced to being a doorman in his own Teahouse. He can hang himself because all the members of his family have left and are on the way to the Western Mountains, hence to the communists."
112,0,"That’s probably what people like Trump and his supporters who voted for him, as well as those who voted not for Clinton but against Trump, will never understand. China is not about the first or the second amendment of the US Constitution, but it is about millennia (not centuries) of exploitation in China itself by various political systems and success in global commerce represented by the famous Silk Roads finally discovered by Marco Polo (1271–1368), which meant that the western world limited to Europe at the time finally came to realizing China was the real global power Europe and then the West tried to become after the discovery of the Americas (1492) and the re-invention of slavery by the Portuguese around 1450 in Africa from Western Africa to Congo, Angola, Mozambique and eastern Africa, plus India on the other side of the Indian Ocean. And China was already a very wide empire long before even Homer and Aeschylus were even born, not to mention Plato and Aristotle, the fanatic supporters of slave societies."
113,0,"Unluckily this play will not be understood by Westerners, especially narrow-minded people like those I have just mentioned, because they think they are hot hamburgers and hotdogs all over and that anyone and everything that is not in their direct mental and geographical territory is nothing but swampy water and rotting mud. Waking up will be difficult and I just hope they do not start throwing their atomic bonbons on us before dying out."

115,0,lovely Chinese poetry
116,0,Nice little text with plenty of characters.
117,0,"Beautiful story, easy read, I finished it in two nights. Can not put it down. It's in Chinese, good format."
118,0,Lao She's brilliant but painful work is made thoroughly and accurately accessible to English speakers with this excellent translation.
119,0,"It's a tough read as we watch Xiangzi fall into one disaster after another, coupled with some tragically bad decisions on his own part. But the pain reveals much about the reality of those who are trapped economically and can't find a reliable path to prosperity in spite of bitterly hard work. However, I think Lao She has embedded a message of hope within the despair, as there were lucky things that came to Xiangzi (his name means lucky) and even the hope of the key blessing that could have transformed him and that neighbor girl,  Fuzi (the Fu means blessing or fortune in the Chinese). Had he accepted and held onto the gifts he was given, had he been a little more patient or a little more wise, and especially had he been a little less selfish, there was greater hope all along, in spite of the injustices inflicted by others. Perhaps or perhaps not---in any case, it's a much deeper book than some might think and one worthy of much reflection."
120,0,Lao She is one of China's great writers and one of the greats in world literature. This book deserves to be read by much wider audiences.
121,0,"Lao can be considered one of the great writers of modern China. His witty, thoughtful and inspiring look at the life of a rickshaw driver at the turn of the 20th century offers critical insight into why the Chinese Revolution happened as well as insight into how the poor perceive their own oppression, Lao's characters are charming, well written and his plot explores the everyday life of the Chinese people."
122,0,Overall I found this to be an interesting book
123,0,"This is a classic of Chinese literature. It tells the story of Hsiang Tzu, who aspires to own a rickshaw and the very hard work and planning it takes to purchase one.. Set in Peking during the 1930s, it captures the physical, cultural, and political environment of that period. This is a sad, enlightening, memorable book."
124,0,"Both a great thought piece and a great Chinese culture read. I think part of this mindset is visible in Chinese adults today, and the ending gave me a lot of thoughts to digest"
125,0,Liked the storyline. Very realistic for the time it was written. There were a lot of stereotypical Chinese stories around that time.
126,0,N O.  S P O I L E R S
127,0,I was immediately drawn into the book and could not put it down. If you are doubtful about purchasing the book I say it is well worth the purchase. This is a book I will read again sometime in the future.
128,0,"Wonderful read-- fast-paced, exquisitely developed characters, and a glimpse into  another time in another culture.  Yet as  testament to in the universality  of this great writer some of the issues including cultural repression and the plight of the world's poor still obtain today."
129,0,One of those novels that gives the reader a graphic view of a life but without the lecturing.  Readers get it without being lectured.
130,0,Beautiful account of the poor working man making decisions to keep his head above water.
131,0,"such a sad book, read it when I was young and loved it.  Still do"
132,0,"The font is a good size, and I thought it was interesting that it was printed the day before I received it. I don't know much about this company that made it and would love to get more books from them if I can find their store or similar."
133,0,"I didn't read this novel before, glad I can get a copy from Amazon. Now I know some background of that time. Sad about Xiangzi and his life. Good book. It's the Chinese edition."
134,0,"China, vast and confusing, a population too large to count, a history older than time, it is impossible find enough space or time to work it all out. This book takes us on a journey through China's recent history through the eyes of one man. It isn't a happy journey; a difficult life at a difficult time but where this book helps is that it gives you just enough of a view of China to hold it in your head, a snapshot. This translation is both easy to read, and digest, not getting in the way of the story. There are some wry observations of the political system and an insight in to how things work. The social commentary on corruption and failings in both the system and the people in it sits within the narrative of one man’s life, a quest for knowledge and a struggle to simply exist. The fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Manchu Restoration and the birth of the Republic, all are shown to make very little difference to the author, life was hard, and the revolution made it no easier for him. Although it's clear that he found the revolution created opportunities for some, at the expense of others. Providing more ways not only to make money but also to spend it. Our journey ends in a different China to where it began with the simple life of an apprentice in the art of paper craft to a world-weary policeman. China remains fascinating and a somewhat elusive place. In the end, the lesson is ""Don't care too much"""

Great time in Hawaii :)"
142,0,"I got these for my daughter who is a 7th grader. She loves them and says that they are surprisingly comfortable. As she says, ""These fish flops make a statement,"" and I have observed how they work as a conversation starter. She says that she got lots of compliments when she wore them to school, and she has noticed that her friends are now getting pairs of their own."

147,0,I was able to catch 42 fish just by wearing theses
148,0,My students actually wanted to get a few fish-flops for an upcoming event to promote our company and stand out at a trade show. My students are ecstatic about the product and it was everything they thought it would be! Very unique and attention grabbing.
149,0,Love this Chinese author. and the book's quality is a plus!
150,0,This book was published in 1999 and contained 16 works by Lao She. There were 15 short stories and 1 essay.
151,0,"Lao She (1899-1966) has been called one of China's best modern writers. He's known for the novel Rickshaw (1936, also called Camel Xiangzi and Rickshaw Boy) and the play Teahouse (1957), among other works. He's also remembered for his insightful short stories, many of which contained humor and featured the townspeople of Beijing, where he was born and grew up. He was of Sinicized Manchu heritage."
152,0,"Based on information provided by the co-translator of this work and an essay included by Lao She himself, it appeared that Lao began writing short stories around the early/mid-1920s and had published several large collections by the mid-1930s. After full-scale war with Japan broke out in July 1937, much of his work was written in support of China's war effort. Of his work after 1949, a compiler of another anthology has noted that it was written ""in the Marxist style."" So perhaps Lao's best--most literary--stories were from the period before the outbreak of war in 1937. In any case, all but one of the works in the present anthology were taken from collections between 1933 and mid-1937. The one later story was from 1943 and depicted a grasping art collector who became a collaborator."
153,0,"For this reader, the two outstanding stories in the collection were ""An Old and Established Name,"" a narrator's description of the decline of a store that couldn't adapt to the times, and ""Neighbors,"" a depiction of a escalating squabble between householders. Both showed insight into human nature and were funny and sad at once. ""A Grand Opening,"" about cynical men running a hospital for profit, was also darkly funny, though it felt as if the writer's good nature left him unable to come up with a suitably grim ending."
154,0,"Not all the stories were humorous. ""Rabbit"" showed the author's ability to depict an artist caught up in the world of Chinese opera and eventually devoured by it. ""Hot Dumplings"" was a memorable vignette about an unhappy couple, and ""Life Choices"" showed a poor couple with a baby and felt as if it might've been based on the author's own life. Lao's humorous stories, however, were by far the liveliest for this reader, as well as the most concisely written."
155,0,"Stories of other types included ""Autobiography of a Minor Character,"" which described at length the narrator's surroundings when he was growing up in Beijing, and ""Ding,"" which followed the thoughts of a boy visiting the seaside. The latter was called the author's only known experiment with the stream-of-consciousness technique and a very early example of it in modern Chinese fiction. The editor speculated that Lao might have been influenced in this regard by Dickens' use of the technique in David Copperfield, since Lao was a great admirer of Dickens, or might have been exposed to the literature of Joyce and Woolf while living in London in 1924-29."
156,0,"Another collection by Lao She is Crescent Moon and Other Stories, by Panda Books of China. ""Grandma Takes Charge,"" a good satirical tale by the author not included in Blades of Grass, appeared in Voices of Modern Asia and Treasury of Modern Asian Stories."
157,0,Some excerpts:
158,0,"""I remember our old neighbour, Young Qiu. By now the 'Young' Qiu of those days is naturally 'Old' Qiu. But even if I were to meet him now, even if he were already a hoary old man, I would still call him 'Young' Qiu. For me, he could never grow old. When we imagine flowers, what springs to mind are blooming red flowers and lush green leaves, not faded blooms that have lost their fragrance and are dropping their petals like rain. It was the same with Young Qiu. In people's minds, he was forever in the springtime of life, though he looked nothing like a flower."""
159,0,"""His face began to look like a dumpling that had split apart while boiling."""
160,0,"""Mrs. Ming was barbaric, and wrangling with a barbarian would demean one's social status. But his wife wasn't willing to let it go at that and insisted that he wreak some sort of vengeance on her behalf."""
161,0,"""The next day was Sunday. Mr. Yang was in the yard cleaning up his garden. Mr. Ming was inside his house repairing the windows. It seemed that the whole world was at peace, and mutual understanding had finally come to mankind."""
162,0,"""After I became a grown man, I once visited the Forbidden City. Red walls followed red walls, the great halls faced each other. Everywhere one ran into walls, and everywhere It was neat and orderly. It was stately and dignified, all right, but I really doubt that the crown prince had ever seen a pumpkin vine growing on a screen wall."""
163,0,"""Even though what we possessed didn't relieve us from our poverty, it did provide us that stability that made each blade of grass and each tree come alive in our hearts. At the very least, it made me a small blade of grass always securely rooted to its own turf. All that I am began here. My character was molded and cast here."""
164,0,Very interesting stories  with so much humor. One of my favorite book collections.
165,0,Enjoyed this one and it has enough of a variety to be a good book in my opinion.
166,0,"So happy that I can get this set of books at such low price. This book series show the war from another angle: No direct description about fighting, but all about how the war slowly destroyed the daily life of a normal Chinese family and the struggling heart of a normal person between fighting for the whole country and keeping silent for a temporary peaceful family. People loved their family. Lao She loved his Beiping. They fought for the country because they were protecting what they treasured."
167,0,good book
168,0,"Historical memoirs are fraught with problems as reminiscences dim or are subjected to revisionism.  More problematic is that the farther back in time the commentator goes, the more the facts are distorted by the writer’s interpretation.  Because Clara Hausske recalled and kept notes on her work in China almost a century ago, the reader of ""In the Shadow of the White Pagoda"" is struck with unvarnished truth about the shattering poverty, malnutrition, sickness, chaos of war and banditry taking place far from the cities.  Yes, the writing is often simplistic and reportorial, but reading Hausske’s description of the challenges she and her husband faced in China in the 1920s, ‘30s and ‘40s is as clear as looking at an unedited film.  There is a level of authenticity as she describes a life that’s hard to imagine — except that other parts of the world are undergoing these same difficulties and opportunities."
169,0,"The Hausskes went to China sponsored by what is now United Board for World Ministries.  Their religious denomination was Congregational, now the United Church of Christ.  Their mission was located literally in the shadow of the pagoda where 20 years earlier Boxer rebels massacred Christians."
170,0,"Albert Hausske left the U.S., with his wife Clara and two toddler children, in 1920 to administer the accounting for a hospital in Taiku, Shansi Province.  This mission was two days’ inland from Tientsin by boat, railway and rickshaw.  The book, extremely well edited by her son, Albert Carol Hausske, was published in 1989 from Clara’s notes, photos and letters."
171,0,"This was the back country that appeared on no one’s tour guide.  The Hausskes were missionaries not to convert some indifferent Buddhists, but to cure those on the verge of death, feed those protein-starved people who saw meat in their diet only on holidays, who were illiterate to the point of having to unlearn “folk wisdom” and embrace proven scientific diet, and to care for people so desperate they abandoned their children to the school as the only hope their progeny would live.  In that, they were lucky also to have served with  Dr. Wiloughby Hemingway, uncle of author Ernest Hemingway, who had arrived there in 1903."
172,0,"Clara offers a positive, forbearing look at daily life with all the quotidian duties, communication obstacles (the Hausskes learned to speak Chinese), and hardship of moving from house to house under trying circumstances.  It is also an insider’s look at life as the Communists approached Nanjing in 1927, themselves emigrating to Korea as refugees, their return when Chiang Kai-shek recaptured Nanjing, and fears as the Japanese took over city after city in the years leading up to 1941.  That declaration of war forced the Hausske family back to the States (there had been occasional furloughs home since 1920) until they could return in the 1950s."
173,0,"She writes, “In 1940, only seven foreign missionaries supervised the care of about fourteen hundred inpatients, ten thousand outpatients, three hundred and fifteen boarding students in the schools, thirty student nurses, several Chinese doctors, and innumerable people in the countryside.”  Her commentary on this is enlightening: “Their lives were simple but very rich.  They were fortunate that there was always plenty of work to keep them in good spirits.  And it was also as well that they could adjust themselves to difficulties when it was necessary to do so.”  Was this a rosy-eyed view?  More likely it was the interpretation of a spiritually rich person who had seen much progress."
174,0,"Surprisingly, Clara displays a total lack of irony or disbelief in her descriptions of children being carried to the hospital on a relative’s back, or a tearful father giving his child to the orphanage so the boy might live."
175,0,"If there is one lapse for this reader, it is that Clara did not apply more subjective reporting and personal response to the political changes raging around them. Their work was threatened, as were the lives of the local population.  The relief work was halted only when the Japanese sent them out of the country and when the Communists refused to let them resume."
176,0,"Today, there often is a knee-jerk reaction to missionaries, seeing them as evangelicals out to corrupt the purity of native populations.  Witness what missionaries did to Native Americans and Hawaiians in the name of “civilization.”  Clara makes almost no reference to religious teaching in her memoir; there is continual detail of the Chinese lives they saved, the children and adults they taught to read and write, and the Western lessons in diet, nutrition and childcare they taught to extend and enrich their lives."
177,0,"The book provides another interesting insight into the independence of this woman.  Clara was often alone when Albert was traveling to other missions.  She regularly traveled by herself or with her children.  She was emancipated years before women gained the respect they deserved.  In many ways, Clara mirrors the life of my grandmother traveling the U.S. on the Chautauqua lecture circuit during the same period.  Yes, there were women who became empowered in that period."
178,0,"I need to disclose that Albert and Clara Hausske were friends of my father, Walter C. Giersbach when he was president of Pacific University, and of my mother.  I have a vague memory of their son, Trevor Hausske, graduating Pacific in the mid 1940s when I was six years old..  And the Hausskes were generous in their gifts of Chinese art to my parents, including their sale of two antique Chinese chests that are still with my family."
179,0,"A few weeks ago I was inventorying the antiques my parents collected and decided to unravel the  mystery of who the Hausskes were, these shadowy people from my childhood.  Out of the that detective work came the discovery of In the Shadow of the White Pagoda, now available only through a used bookseller."
180,0,"This is an incredible story writen by the wife of a missionary.  They left everything they knew in Chicago in 1920 to live in China.  They came back every 5 years on sabatical but always left their hearts in China.  Clara tells what it is like raising children, managing a home in a strange land, and backing up her husband in everything he did.  She eventually found her own way to give to the people by creating classes to teach young mothers to be and new mothers how to raise their child.  Back then the mortality rate was terrible.  The mothers knew nothing of prenatal care, nor did they know to sterilize, etc.  Clara wrote this book years after they left China.  For a long time only family members had copies of the original typed manuscript.  Then after her death, their oldest son, Albert Jr. edited the manuscript, put in the pictures and finally had it published.  Only about 1000 copies were made, to the best of my knowledge.  I've read the book over and over and love it every time.  Of course I am a bit biased as Clara was my grandmother!"
181,0,how could I not like it? there are pictures of my grandparents in there!
182,0,The book was delivered ahead of schedule during the holidays.  Excellent wrapping to secure and protect the book.  Very happy with the service!
