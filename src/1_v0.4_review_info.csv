0,0,"""The notebook"" was ordered for my wife after she saw the movie. She says that she rates it five stars."
1,0,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
2,0,"Although the translation is atrocious, and the book is poorly redacted, it may be the most concise version ever made of this fantastic book, which should get a lot more credit in the West. Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English. Personally, some simple mistakes, repeated along the 1000 pages of the Romance, became very grating, like ""the Cao Cao's army""."
3,0,"I can still recommend it for skilled readers, because it's the only version for Kindle at an affordable price, and it's quicker to read than other translations."
4,0,"It may be ponderous to read, and possibly difficult to keep track of everyone, but it was an enjoyable read for me."
5,0,After watching Red Cliff I had the desire to read more of the before and after. This book filled that desire.
6,0,"If one want's to learn a bit more about individuals, or discern fact from fiction, the link on the kindle that takes you to Wikipedia is a useful tool."
7,0,"This book is very long and can be hard to get through due to the overwhelming amount of characters and events going on.  As an American, there is a culture barrier for me there as well.  However I am thankful I persevered through the story.  I've always been a big Dynasty Warriors fan, and Redcliff is one of my favorite movies. It was great to get a more complete picture of the events of the Three Kingdoms, and all the little details and interactions.  A great read if you can make it through!"
8,0,"I was introduced to the world of Romance of the Three Kingdoms thanks to the Dynasty Warriors game, and decided I wanted to read to original work that the games were based on. This is actually the second copy of the story that I've bought; the first had a drastically different translation style -- Liu Bei was Liu Pei, Guan Yu was Kuan Yu, etc -- and it was off-putting enough that I found it difficult to follow."
9,0,"For those who are here because of the same reason I was, you'll be pleased to know that this printing shares the vast majority of the translations with the games we know and love. Sun Ce is Sun Ce, not Sun T'se!"
10,0,"One of the problems with ordering a book on Kindle is that you don't know its full length in pages. ""The romance of three Kingdoms must be a rather thick volume and it is more a historical chronicle than a romance. For a non-Chinese the profusion of names and places make it confusing ( a map and a register of persons would have helped ). So , although it is ineresting ,it is also tiring"

12,0,"Superb, still one of the best piece of literatures. I have read it many times in other language. It is interesting to read it in English and see some variations in the interpretation of the translator. There are problems due to name pronunciations."
13,0,"I quite like books that are long even if they are very dry, like economics books.  But this one was a bit too not good to read.  It reads like a very simple story but too many characters are thrown at you for no more than a line or two and you end up lost trying to unnecessarily remember them all."
14,0,"Its a good story, but not very readable."
15,0,I love the stories. I first learned about the three kingdoms playing DYNASTY WARRIORS and reading the book brought real depth and insight into the history. A great read if you can overlook some typos and bad translations.
16,0,"The characters names get to be to much, since they are Chinese name they get to be hard to remember, but it is a great read.  The action moves right alone so name are not to much of problem."
17,0,The Romance of Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong is an exceptional book. I recommend it to all from my heart.
18,0,I am a PhD student with major in signal processing and machine learning with applications to neuroimaging data. I must emphasize that the following review is affected by my knowledge and review criteria. So it is somewhat subjective.
19,0,This book may be the newest book on EEG signal processing. It reviewed some newly developed techniques with emphasizing on independent component analysis (ICA). Plenty of references are provided at the end of each chapter.
20,0,"However, compared to many classic books in signal procesisng and EEG fields, I have to give three stars to this book, due to the following reasons:"
21,0,"1) Some contents that are not important are introduced with many pages, while some contents that are important are introduced briefly (note the main body of the book has only 265 pages)."
22,0,"For example, in the 265-page book, the authors use 34 pages to introduce the background, while use half a page (or one or two paragraphs) to introduce some important algorithms which are new to EEG signal processing and have potential applications."
23,0,"Another example. We know that using ICA to detect, separate and classify P300 signals is very important in the history of EEG/ERP processing. There are numerous literature involve it. But the authors give only half a page to state it."
24,0,2) Some algorithms introduced in this book are not complete.
25,0,"Through the description of the book, the reader may not well understand some algorithms, such as the Parallel Factor Analysis (Section 7.3.2), because they are introduced briefly. For some algorithms the definitions of some symbols are missed, such as the algorithm in Section 5.2.4: what's the meaning of Q? And in Section 3.1.3-3.1.4 what's the meaning of r?"
26,0,"For some important algorithms the authors almost directly list the equations of the algorithms without explanation, such as the one in Section 5.2.9. If there is possible for the authors to provide the second edition, I think they should add something important about the algorithms, such as the motivation of algorithms, the key steps in the development of algorithms (eg. the construction of objective function of algorithms), the physical meanings of algorithms, and their performance in practical applications and so on."
27,0,3) The selection of algorithms in each topic is strongly affected by the authors' interest and their published work.
28,0,"For example, in Section 3.1.3-3.1.4 the authors use 7 pages to introduce their work in the ICASSP conference, while leaving lots of important methods (proposed by others) published in other top journals or top conferences unmentioned."
29,0,"Another example: In Section 7.2.1 (Preprocessing of EEG) the authors only introduced their published work, but not introduced others' work. I think in this section some things should be added. For example, there are other preprocessing aspects in addition to artifact removal. Even in artifact removal by ICA, other methods may need to be added such as several kinds of constrained ICA, methods based on higher-order statistics (using ICA as preprocessing and then using conventional methods to remove artifact), and the automatic methods for artifact removal. Especially, the removal of eye artifact may need to be added, because removal of eye artifact is very important for the visual attention experiments."
30,0,"4) Some places in the book may be not clear and may arouse readers' misunderstand, or even wrong."
31,0,"For example, in page 98 the authors said, ""for the EEG mixing model....the propagation velocity is equivalent to that of electromagnetic waves (300,000km/s). Therefore the delay is almost zero and the mixing model can always be considered to be instantaneous (ICA model)"". It's wrong. The delay definitely exists in EEG signals, since the propagation velocity of EEG signals is very very low compared to the electromagnetic waves. And there are some literatures using convolutive ICA to process EEG signals (Neural Computation 2006, Neural Networks 2003, etc)."
32,0,"Another example. In Section 1.2.3 the authors put skewness and kurtosis, which are often seen as measurement of non-Gaussinity in statistics literature, in the subsection of measurement of nonstationarity. Although the authors think the skewness and kurtosis are useful in the measurement of non-stationarity of signals with time-varying distribution, they may need to give clearer explanation, and provide other conventional measurement of nonstationarity (maybe it is necessary to provide the definition of nonstationarity, since there are several definitions of it in signal processing literature)."
33,0,"In summary, the book is absolutely not a textbook, but a long review, such that you may not fully understand algorithms but you can look for original papers to get details according the references provided by the book."
34,0,"I hope the authors can provide the second edition, in which they can balance their work and others' work, balance each contents (important contents and introductory contents), provide more details on algorithms (at least those important algorithms), include more newly developed techniques or important algorithms, and modify some errors. More importantly, they need to carefully exam their manuscript."
35,0,"Stephen King's Dark Tower epic is easily one of my favorite fantasy series of all time.  It features a wonderful world mixing pretty much my two favorite things:  the world-building of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings & the imagery of Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy.  Unfortunately, I hadn't ever owned the complete series; I read them either through libraries, online or from friends. Having them all in one place where I can burn all my money in one go and re-read them again and again and again is the perfect gift to myself.  I'm not usually a fan of movie tie-in editions, but here it isn't distracting since it still features original covers (not movie stills).  You just have to see Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey's name on the box.  Overall if you've never owned the complete set then this is a fantastic investment.  If you've never read the series and are thinking about buying it on a whim, all I can say that is if you love fantasy, westerns, sci-fi, horror, epic adventure, and characters that you'll never want to stop traveling with, then stop reading this right now and hit the ""order"" button."
36,0,"I actually bought this as a gift for my dad, who reads constantly but does not tend to read fantasy, horror, or Stephen King. He told me it would be a while until he got started on the series because of deadlines (he's retired but still writes textbooks). Two days later he told me, jokingly, that he was very mad at me for getting him hooked on this series, as he has been unable to put the books down and binged the first 3 novels in 2 days, ignoring deadlines and emails and probably the various chores my mom assigned him. =D"
37,0,"Got me thru 3 months of segregation in prison.... Great read for those doing a decent amount of time... Glad I had the time.... Only in prison can u read so much so quick, usually uninterrupted, that I couldn't imagine trying to finish this whole  series in the world, unless jobless or Idk.... But you should get in tune with this one!"
38,0,"I bought this for my granddaughter.  I loved the fact I did not have to track down all of the books to purchase them.  She started with a book in the middle of the series without realizing she was reading out of sequence.  She did enjoy the book, so I decided to treat her to an exciting adventure that only author Stephen King can spin.  It was a mixture of an old western, some 14th century chivalry and good old fashioned on the edge of your seat reading.  The Stand was my favorite book, but this one definitely came in a close second.  This is totally worth the price of the set."
39,0,Read the 1st three books when they came out. Got the box set a month ago and read the series start to finish in about 3 weeks. Over all I enjoyed the books although I found more than a few errors and inconsistencies. If I reread the series again in a few years I will outline them even though I'm sure no one cares. Great story telling over all.
40,0,My son-in-law encouraged me for years to read this series. He read it when the books first came out and mentioned having to re-read some of the books to put it all together. That's why I hesitated reading it. I received the boxed set for Christmas and began my reading adventure. I believe it was easier to read as a complete series than over many years. As I read I learned so much about the author that helps me to understand Stephen King and that makes his books a better read. King's books are on so many different levels anyway and the Dark Tower series is even more yet. I loved how he made himself part of the story and told of his problems completing the series. I am at a loss now what to do tomorrow since I finished reading Dark Tower tonight. It's a true separation anxiety.
41,0,"I bought the Dark Tower Book series used so I was expecting a little wear and tear.  The books I received look brand new! There are no signs of wear and seeing as how they are going to be a bday gift, I believe he is going to be so impressed with the collection."
42,0,Bought this boxed set for my son for Xmas.  he loves it.  Great story and very well done as far as packaging and appearance.  The copies are new and in excellent condition.  the boxed set shipped in a larger box that they took the time to insulate again damaged.  Nice to know they took the time to protect their product against shipping damage.
43,0,I am impressed. There's only one insignificant detail on the copy of the waste lands as I display in the photo but it isn't a problem for me and the bookset is flawless besides that.
44,0,"  I went through every copy and every page and they smell like fresh print and there are no dents or scratches, which I was not expecting. For the price, the quality is 5 stars. I asked some questions to the seller about the publication and they replied immediately with a thorough answer that was very helpful."
45,0,"  I highly recommend buying from this seller. High quality product, excellent customer support, and incredibly low price. PS- if you're having trouble removing books from the bookcase; they give you three cardboard sheets which serve as sliders. You insert them on each side of the book you're removing and the book simply slides out as displayed in the photo above."
46,0,"On third book and enjoying the story, glad I got the whole set."
47,0,"I purchased this for my brother as a Christmas gift. Like me, he is a book collector, and has been wanting the first volume of this title, ""A Dream of Red Mansions"" for some time now (he already has Volumes 2 and 3). I purchased this book through a third party vendor here on Amazon and the book arrived intact and in excellent, almost new condition. It is a hardcover, printed in China, and is the first edition. The book contains some beautiful color illustrations depicting important scenes from the book. A classic of Chinese literature, this is a story that will appeal to readers keen to explore the diversity in world literature."
48,0,"This is one of the most interesting and profound novels I have read, a masterpiece of Chinese literature and a world class contribution. I genuinely enjoyed this translation of this 250-year old novel. The text flowed well and was clear and understandable.  The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature. The descriptions and characterization are so realistic you feel as if you have known those people and places for years. I would say this is a must-read!"
49,0,"I am studying Chinese and but my reading is not good enough to be able to read the original of this famous classic novel.  What I really liked about this edition was having Chinese and English face to face, which helps me practice reading my Chinese.  The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.  The 6 volumes are thick and heavy, and we are treated to a full page illustration in the style of Chinese painting every other chapter.  That's about 60 paintings."
50,0,"The reason I give it a star less is the prevalence of typos.  You're likely to encounter one every page or every few pages.  Most were obvious and easy to correct, but it was rather annoying.  A little more quality control in the typesetting would have helped."
51,0,"It will take a while to finish, but I love the book so far!"
52,0,"Present Chinese culture rests on seven pillars. One of these is the sayings of Kung Fu Tse, the others are found embodied in the ""Four Classics"", of which this is one. An easy read, an easy interpretation. Highly recommend for any traveler, and those who want to understand our Oriental Neighbor."
53,0,I read this book second of the 4 classics (or 5 depending on who you speak to)
54,0,"It was like watching a long, slow soap opera. The descriptions of food, clothing, and gifts were amazing."
55,0,Just the long chapters discussing house politics and Baoyu's aloofness made me force myself to finish.
56,0,"The ending was really good, and somewhat unexpected."
57,0,"Romanization schemes for Chinese are notoriously imperfect, if for no other reasons than that 4 tones -- 5 if you count a null tone sometimes used -- are not immediately obvious to those who do not have a speaking knowledge of any of the Chinese dialects."
58,0,"Perhaps I am prejudiced, having learned Chinese primarily using texts that happened to (mostly) rely on the Pinyin system.  However, it seems to me that Pinyin has the distinct merit of adhering most closely to the principles of most of the primary European languages (especially Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages) where vowel sounds are far more regular and predictable than they are in English, particularly."
59,0,"I can't comment (yet) on this particular translation, though I am working through several other bilingual editions that are part of the same Foreign Language Press publication project, and can give a few early impressions based on what I've read so far."
60,0,"These translations are commendable in that they seek to provide a full translation of the works in question, thereby attempting to avoid some of the cultural ""hyperbole"" that has been attached to some of these works by translators approaching the texts from outside the context of Chinese culture.  As a native-born speaker of English, I did not begin studying Chinese until my late teens and will never have the complete understanding of the culture to argue persuasively over the finer points of these translations."
61,0,"However, on the intuitive side, I do not a certain defensiveness at times and an effort to provide translations that are either culturally acceptable to present-day political realities in the Chinese mainland regions, or that may simply be dodging some of the tougher editorial calls to be made."
62,0,"It is very clear, especially in some of the introductory matter that accompanies many texts in this series, that the final English version was approved by someone not a native speaker of idiomatic English.  In most cases, the evidence appears in simple errors of literal translation of phrases that make perfect idiomatic sense in Chinese, but, rendered with too much literal faithfulness, are puzzling to say the least when they are rendered in English."
63,0,"I would agree with others who've commented that these texts are probably best for someone whose knowledge of Chinese is limited and is looking for an English ""crib sheet"" for entering into the Chinese originals (or in some cases, modern Chinese renditions of Classical Chinese texts, as in FLP's 2 volume translation of the works of Zhuangzi).  Note, however, that the FLP translation of Zhuangzi is (unless I'm mistaken) the most complete translation presently available in English, and this is true of many other texts in the FLP's publishing project)."
64,0,"As a student of Chinese language, I really don't care much what romanization method is used.  They are all far from ideal.  What I care about is that someone is making these texts available in English, even if the translations are not always the most poetic -- where poetry is called for."
65,0,"I love this story, I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back. The Original book is over 5000 pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the 1835 original unfinished work. Le's put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is 28 episodes each an hour and a half long"
66,0,"I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the ""Redists"", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!"
67,0,Not a good translation and hard to follow. I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.
68,0,This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline.  It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him.  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful.  I think the story takes place in the 17th century.  I don't think it can be read in a hurry.  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book.
69,0,Allow a year or so to enjoy it.  I return to it again and again.
70,0,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize."
71,0,"I slogged through, and found the stories engaging, the descriptions of the culture fascinating, and the plotlines very different from western stories. The time invested in completing the series was a joy. Thankfully, a glossary of individual names, relationships, and even the family trees for the families most involved appears in each volume. I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book."
72,0,"It's usually difficult to find all five volumes, so I thank Amazon for pulling the Penguin versions together."
73,0,"Nothing good lasts forever, whether we are talking about the Garden or this novel itself… Volumes 4 and 5 are thought to be written by Gao E a generation after Cao Xueqin’s untimely death.  There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s."
74,0,"Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days."
75,0,"When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point."
76,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
77,0,Contains the Dream of the Red Chamber
78,0,"This is the point where the author had left off and his friends subsequently pieced together his notes and drafts.  The story becomes quickly incredibly depressing, all presaged in the preceding volumes but still.  it is realistically done and vivid but the story, and its characters, lose a lot of their charm.  They pay their debt of tears, with interest."
79,0,The DVD is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
80,0,Good quality and fast shipping
81,0,"I am a big fan of The Story of the Stone original version (in Chinese), and I knew how terrible this English version is. Some of the sentences are very rude and unreasonable according to Chinese manners, and the names.... Nah"
82,0,I should like to return this book because it is smaller by 1/2 inch in perimeter than the other 4 volumes of the same book I acquired through Amazon.  I'd like the volumes to match in size.
83,0,  The book took so long in arriving that I had read the book borrowed from a college library by the time I received it.
84,0,  The book is also rather yellowish.
85,0,From Emily D. (pen name)
86,0,"It truly is a challenge to find a well written Christian novel.  I've only found a few and this is one of them. I don't know who the protagonist, Will Chambers, is modeled after or if he's a composite, but I would like to meet him or them! He is a very brilliant, insightful attorney. The story expertly combines Will's natural abilities with God's supernatural interventions, weaving them together to hold the reader's attention until the story is resolved on the final page!"
87,0,"Grabbed from the beginning, this novel held me throughout. If you’re a lesser us better when it comes to government, this will drive you nuts. I found myself so engrossed with the drama unfolding that I began to join in with Will as he fights the system which had gone off the rails. A must read from an author who truly engages his readers."
88,0,"As far as I'm concerned,  Mr. Parshall is #1 in the legal thriller  genre; better than John  Grisham.  He expertly weaves his stories through twists, turns and surprises. This story really carried me quickly through to the end. I read it in one day. I love that he includes Christianity in his books. His faith adds so much depth to the story. I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. As a former legal secretary,  I'm always fascinated by legal thrillers."
89,0,"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall.  As with the first one, this is well done."
90,0,The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse.  There are many twists and turns throughout.  The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.
91,0,"In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues.  The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline.  That part is well done also."
92,0,"I will certainly be checking out more books in this series.  I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."
93,0,This is an excellent thriller series. Lots of action. You will not want to put it down. Read them in order.
94,0,The premise is scary. This is an engrossing book I recommend you read this when you have a lot of time to read it
95,0,"Enjoyed this one as much as the first book in the series.  Holds your interest.  And the characters are very ""real""."
96,0,I look forward to the read. Thanks
97,0,EXCELLENT READ. Would like to believe a lawyer could have this much feeling for jusice and the truth.
98,0,"Of the five books in this series, I've only read the first two.  This book was more enjoyable than the first. I didn't want to put it down."
99,0,I bought this for a friend after reading my copy of the 1975 (I think) edition with the pages turning yellow. It's like medicine. Everyone who struggles with the idea that God is a God of love should read this. Excellent Biblical perspective on how God's love can be known even in the painful experiences of life. Why God's love isn't obvious on the basis of casual observation. Impossible to understand without faith in Jesus Christ.
100,0,"I feel like this is a preacher who is preaching the deep, meat of the Lord's heart.....Oswald Chambers is my favorite!  Every paragraph has a compelling and truthful thought."
101,0,Oswald Chambers teachings are always challenging but the challenge is always good to bring us back to the word of God.
102,0,Fabulous book. I've read it three times and keep reading it. Oswald Chambers was really a wonderful godly man. Very deep
103,0,Oswald chambers has taught me a depth of the he bible that has been astoundingly beautiful. He is the one person including his precious wife that I can't wait tp see I'm heaven. His love of Christ and his devotion to our Lord is sweet fragrance of heaven!
104,0,As usual Oswald makes you think!!
105,0,Anything O Chambers writes is dynamite
106,0,Great amounts of wisdom in this book. Oswald never disappoints with his writing. Definitely worth a read and definitely a book I will read multiple times throughout life!
107,0,"Awesome book, and anything Oswald Chambers writes is annointed by the Holy Spirit. You will see a man dying to flesh to write HIS heart out."
108,0,I love anything by Oswald Chambers and it makes an excellent gift for anyone that needs an insight to the word of God.
109,0,"I was so looking forward to this coloring book that I also purchased the version printed in Thailand.  While I like things about both versions, for me, the US version is the clear winner.  Why?  Simply put – it has more designs to color.  I'll go into some of the differences at toward the end of this review."
110,0,"“The Night Voyage” is the story of a young girl and her cat, Phoebe, who go on a night adventure giving away presents to others.  Or did they?  That is the question left unanswered at the end of this story."
111,0,"The coloring book is filled with Daria Song's beautiful artwork and imaginative design concepts.  From paper crane airplanes to old-fashioned bicycles to gorgeous air balloons, each page is a wonderful opportunity to color."
112,0,"In addition to the 64 pages of designs, there are thumbnails of each and a bonus coloring page as well as a card that can be cut out and colored. (with both cutting lines and folding line included.)"
113,0,"This is what I experienced while coloring in this book and testing the page with my coloring medium.  In the comments section below, I will list the coloring medium I use for testing and coloring."
114,0,64 pages of Daria Song designs plus bonus page and card
115,0,Printed on both sides of the page
116,0,"Paper is bright white, very lightly rough, heavyweight and non-perforated"
117,0,Binding is both glued and sewn – not the type that is easy to snip threads to remove pages.  I don't recommend this as so many of the designs spread across two pages
118,0,Designs merge into the binding area
119,0,Most designs spread across two pages
120,0,Separate dust cover which has coloring opportunities on the inside and an attached cover which can be colored as well.
121,0,Alcohol-based markers bleed through this paper
122,0,"Water-based markers, gel pens and India ink pens do not bleed through and do not leave shadows on the back of the page.  Some gel pens require additional drying time."
123,0,"Colored pencils worked very well with this paper.  I tested oil and wax based pencils.  I was able to get good pigment lay down with both types.  Layering the same color for deeper color, multiple colors and blending with a blending stick worked well and easily."
124,0,US versus Thailand printing:
125,0,Both versions have their advantages.  The Thailand version was printed on a slightly off white when compared to the US one (thought I originally thought of it was simply white.)  It also had colored images and colored cards included with some single page versions of designs which were on two-pages spreads.  You can see my review and video of this version from May of this year on Amazon under the name “The Present” by Daria Song.
126,0,"For me, the US version was the better of the two but I am happy that I have both.  The US version is printed on bright white paper that was able to take all but alcohol-based markers without showing through.  There are many pages of designs not included in the Thailand version at all.  The detached dust cover, which is different from the original two books by Ms. Song, was a nice new touch with coloring opportunities as well.  While the books are approximately the same size and the US version actually has less pages overall, it weighs more which leads me to believe that the paper is thicker."
127,0,"I was so excited to receive my pre-order.  I have ALL of Daria Song coloring books!  ""the night voyage"" adventure is breathtaking!"
128,0,"I promise, I did not bend this book nor did I turn it inside of itself but, the first 3-pages came loose within 4-days of using this book. I am really disappointed as I had colored heavily on 4-pages and got them to the point where I was pleased with them. Opening the book on day 5 and having the pages come loose was so not cool at all. I will tape them in and have a binder for books that do this. The book is my favorite of the 3 released thus-far and this is a big disappointment because it had not happened to the other books, just this one."
129,0,"Like others have said and as some have demonstrated in pictures, the images are really stunning. I would purchase again and may need to because of the loose page issue. I just cannot figure out how to prevent this as I had used the book lying flat."
130,0,"I would give this lovely coloring book five stars if it were not printed to the very edges of the pages. That makes coloring the edges difficult, and elements in the binding side are impossible to completely color (many of the scenes are two-page spreads). Trying to color into the crease ends up breaking the back and loosening the pages. The pictures are whimsical, very detailed, and definitely not the type that can be colored in a few minutes. The paper quality is excellent for colored pencils. I find that I get the best results with pencils that are of a little firmer texture. The book has a fairly heavy card type cover and a dust jacket over that."
131,0,"The pictures are of a dream adventure, so don't expect consistency from page to page in what the little girl is wearing or how her hair is styled!"
132,0,"If you want the best I MEAN BESTTTT!!! Color book out there.. Here it is.. It has advanced drawn pictures that will take you hours to finish.  The paper is high quality and can withstand most coloring pencils, water color pencils and also water color in pots and liquids.  It can take some markers but not the Spectrum noir markers. Those bleed through the paper.  I have had good luck with the Crayola metal markers and no bleed though.  There are sooo many pages in here, that if you color every day it will still take you months to finish.  Most of the drawn images are in two page fold outs and alot of trees (my favourite)  and also ariel views and just so many little details!  Hope you enjoy.  I was so happy when i saw Amazon sitting on my doorstep.. :)  THANK YOU DARIA SONG!!  This is by the way, her best book yet!  I have all of them."
133,0,"THESE ARE GORGEOUS and HIGH QUALITY.  Keep in mind that these are not perforated pages and pages are not meant to be torn out.  This is a storybook that you can give uncolored or colored as a gift.  There is a bonus card on the very last page, and that can be cut out.  It is a good sized card but VERY small and difficult to color.  I would suggest fineliners.  The paper does let you use a variety of pens and pencils without bleeding through but of course you should test it first.  If you press very hard on your pages as you color, try to take it easier, as the paper is very thick but the impressions can still show through."
134,0,"There is a dust-cover, which is also just wonderful.  Remove that while you work and then put it on to protect it or make it more presentable as a gift."
135,0,I'm mad for Daria Song's stuff now.  Each of her books are incredible and I have now bought 2 more besides.  There's a real satisfaction when a page is done--and these are actually worth your time and worth keeping.
136,0,"This is such a cute book! I loved the time Garden that i bought two copies at the store and colored them BOTH. I might get another copy in fact. But this one is even better. I like the cat. And i like the message. The little girl who had a gazillion presents, wanted to share them with others. If you want to teach sharing, this is a good way to do it. Daria is such a great artist and writer. I hope she makes more!"
137,0,"The pictures work just fine as they are for images but they are not really suited for coloring pages. This has hundreds of tiny details for each page. Some are too small for a colored pencil. Furthermore, the images are basically monochrome themes. Hundreds of leaves on one tree, stars in a sky, boxes. Or a large wall on a house.  In summary I think the book is beautiful but it does not work for my purposes.  The book is clearly intended to be an illustration of a story. Perhaps the author could write in the story and forget referring to it as a coloring book."
138,0,"This book had more pages that I would consider coloring, compared to the “The Night Voyage book. After awhile it gets tedious to keep coloring buildings and tiny houses and big giant clocks and numberous details after details. Mandala drawerings are not my cup of tea but I felt it would be a change for me to try. I find it boring. Everywhere the little girl was in the picture I liked except pictures with millions of tiny houses"
139,0,OMG....
140,0,"This coloring book is wonderful from the beautiful pictures to the beautiful cover of the book; then you get a bonus,a poster thats what i call it."
141,0,I own over 50 coloring books and this is in my top three....
142,0,Im hoping you have other coloring books out on the market...
143,0,Now i have to go investagate..lol
144,0,God you do some wonderful art work.
145,0,"Stephen King's Dark Tower epic is easily one of my favorite fantasy series of all time.  It features a wonderful world mixing pretty much my two favorite things:  the world-building of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings & the imagery of Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy.  Unfortunately, I hadn't ever owned the complete series; I read them either through libraries, online or from friends. Having them all in one place where I can burn all my money in one go and re-read them again and again and again is the perfect gift to myself.  I'm not usually a fan of movie tie-in editions, but here it isn't distracting since it still features original covers (not movie stills).  You just have to see Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey's name on the box.  Overall if you've never owned the complete set then this is a fantastic investment.  If you've never read the series and are thinking about buying it on a whim, all I can say that is if you love fantasy, westerns, sci-fi, horror, epic adventure, and characters that you'll never want to stop traveling with, then stop reading this right now and hit the ""order"" button."
146,0,"I actually bought this as a gift for my dad, who reads constantly but does not tend to read fantasy, horror, or Stephen King. He told me it would be a while until he got started on the series because of deadlines (he's retired but still writes textbooks). Two days later he told me, jokingly, that he was very mad at me for getting him hooked on this series, as he has been unable to put the books down and binged the first 3 novels in 2 days, ignoring deadlines and emails and probably the various chores my mom assigned him. =D"
147,0,"Got me thru 3 months of segregation in prison.... Great read for those doing a decent amount of time... Glad I had the time.... Only in prison can u read so much so quick, usually uninterrupted, that I couldn't imagine trying to finish this whole  series in the world, unless jobless or Idk.... But you should get in tune with this one!"
148,0,"I bought this for my granddaughter.  I loved the fact I did not have to track down all of the books to purchase them.  She started with a book in the middle of the series without realizing she was reading out of sequence.  She did enjoy the book, so I decided to treat her to an exciting adventure that only author Stephen King can spin.  It was a mixture of an old western, some 14th century chivalry and good old fashioned on the edge of your seat reading.  The Stand was my favorite book, but this one definitely came in a close second.  This is totally worth the price of the set."
149,0,Read the 1st three books when they came out. Got the box set a month ago and read the series start to finish in about 3 weeks. Over all I enjoyed the books although I found more than a few errors and inconsistencies. If I reread the series again in a few years I will outline them even though I'm sure no one cares. Great story telling over all.
150,0,My son-in-law encouraged me for years to read this series. He read it when the books first came out and mentioned having to re-read some of the books to put it all together. That's why I hesitated reading it. I received the boxed set for Christmas and began my reading adventure. I believe it was easier to read as a complete series than over many years. As I read I learned so much about the author that helps me to understand Stephen King and that makes his books a better read. King's books are on so many different levels anyway and the Dark Tower series is even more yet. I loved how he made himself part of the story and told of his problems completing the series. I am at a loss now what to do tomorrow since I finished reading Dark Tower tonight. It's a true separation anxiety.
151,0,"I bought the Dark Tower Book series used so I was expecting a little wear and tear.  The books I received look brand new! There are no signs of wear and seeing as how they are going to be a bday gift, I believe he is going to be so impressed with the collection."
152,0,Bought this boxed set for my son for Xmas.  he loves it.  Great story and very well done as far as packaging and appearance.  The copies are new and in excellent condition.  the boxed set shipped in a larger box that they took the time to insulate again damaged.  Nice to know they took the time to protect their product against shipping damage.
153,0,I am impressed. There's only one insignificant detail on the copy of the waste lands as I display in the photo but it isn't a problem for me and the bookset is flawless besides that.
154,0,"  I went through every copy and every page and they smell like fresh print and there are no dents or scratches, which I was not expecting. For the price, the quality is 5 stars. I asked some questions to the seller about the publication and they replied immediately with a thorough answer that was very helpful."
155,0,"  I highly recommend buying from this seller. High quality product, excellent customer support, and incredibly low price. PS- if you're having trouble removing books from the bookcase; they give you three cardboard sheets which serve as sliders. You insert them on each side of the book you're removing and the book simply slides out as displayed in the photo above."
156,0,"On third book and enjoying the story, glad I got the whole set."
157,0,"If you've read the novels this far, you want to know how it all ends.  The translator, however, in his preface, indicates that many things contribute to this volume seeming convoluted and straying from the general theme of the previous books.  First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition."
158,0,"You get some closure--the story draws to an end and homage is paid to the theological theme of realizing the primacy of the spiritual world over the material world.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say that you are expecting a fall from grace with a stalwart conviction that life isn't over--a Chinese version of the Book of Job--but you get a lot of deus ex machina events that give it more of a fairy tale ending than what Cao Xueqin hinted at throughout the first three volumes."
159,0,Part of my culture
160,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
161,0,This novel definitely deserves its place in the topmost tier of global literature.  I was not convinced of that until I reached this volume. Amazing that it came to such a complete and inevitable conclusion when it had to be finalized after the author's death by others.
162,0,"I read all  5 volumes of this translation of the 18th Century Chinese novel known as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. The stone in question is a small magic jade found in the mouth of the newborn Jia Baoyu. It is the story of the journey through life of that stone and the beautiful young man Bao-yu. Written 300+ years before Downton Abbey this is also a story of a family, the fabulous mansion and garden they live in and the complicated relationships they have with their many servants. Poetry, painting, landscape and architecture, flowers, herbal medicines, Taost priests and Buddhist monks, rape, murder, thievery, jealousy, corruption, death and beauty dance through the pages like nothing else I have ever read."
163,0,"I've read all parts of The Story of the Stone.  It starts and ends in a mystical fashion; coming full circle in a traditional ying/yang way.  Wonderful five volume story about two wealthy families closely connected to the throne.  Although there's not much known about the true author, I suspect that it was written by a maid.  There is incredible detail from the perspective of the servents working for their sometimes nutty employers.  The family actually built a garden at one point in honor of a visit from a daughter who had been chosen to be a royal concubine.  If you want to immerse yourself in the ups and downs, daily life, (warts and all) of 1750's Chinese culture don't miss The Story of the Stone et al."
164,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
165,0,Great series.
166,0,This is the fifth and final installment in the classic Chinese story.  It gives a feel for cultural history of the Chinese people.
167,0,"Read it for a literature class in college. Interesting story, would recommend. This is book 5 of a 5 book set. Each book has 24 chapters."
168,0,"What a beautiful book. i am happy i followed the recommendation of another reviewer who encourages to get the edition with the original writing language, not the updated lingo. At first I thought this was too laborious to read, having gotten used to reading some other devotionals that I've come to call ""Fast food reads."" This book is a ""sit down restaurant"" read, and once I settled into the idea that I wasnt going to zip through a day's entry, but that it was something to be chewed on, kind of like how cows chew cud and ruminate, lol, then I began to cherish the depth of expression in this book. I have since bought two more as gifts. A timeless collection of writings with enough hidden in it for many readings."
169,0,"clear, beautiful insightful messages from multiple saints. With so many terrible devotions out there like 'Jesus calling', this and 'my utmost for his highest', remain two classic timeless devotions. They do NOT present as if Jesus was talking which is the main problem with many others. When he died He said ""It is finished"" When God speaks to me it is not my place to go sell that word to the world but to act on it and be obedient. What these classic devotions like Streams in the Dessert do are present insights and thoughts based on Biblical truths but not in the disguise of God's own words!"
170,0,I ordered this for a friend who lost her husband. I have a paperback version in my car that I read on my lunch hour. It is very dog eared and worn and written in and underlined. In the busy work day it's wonderful to have a break and get back in the Word. There is a verse and then writing. Encouraging and filled with hope. I also sent my brother in another State a copy as he is going through tough times. It is great for all seasons of your life. It is a daily devotional and I have gone through it several years -- but each year is a little different than the prior year as far as your life circumstances.
171,0,"One of my favorite features of this updated edition of Streams in the Desert are the enhancements added by the editor. The enhancements by the editor include referencing Scripture quotes and three different indexes (Contributor, Scripture, and Subject). My favorite enhancement is the subject index. This makes it easy to look up topics of interest and find relevant devotionals. While technically this book is supposed to be a ""daily"" devotional (one per day), I like to use it as a reference as well to jump around different sections and read whatever I happen to be interested in at the time. I believe this updated, edited edition is well worth purchasing due to the value added."
172,0,"Before this book, I had only tried a devotional or two on my Bible app...could never stick with it. I heard good things about Streams In The Desert, so I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. I love having a physical copy to read everyday (as opposed to just reading daily devotionals from my phone) and personally love the modernized text of this edition. I use the SOAP bible study method with each entry and that really helps me to understand it. I love this devotional so much and can't wait to get some copies for my family."
173,0,"I have loved this book for over thirty years and used is year after year. No matter what is going on in my life, the devotion speaks me it and lifts me up.  I got this one as a gift for a friend who has been going through very difficult problems in several areas of her life and I hoped it would be a help to her as it has been to me for so long."
174,0,"The best on the market.  I receive God's direction daily, as I read from Streams In The Desert.  It is so relevant to what God is doing in my life.  This was a gift to someone that had invited me to a Bible Study, 30 years ago, when my husband had been murdered."
175,0,"God brought this instrument to me 15 months ago, when I was working a Book Table at a Spiritual Renewal Retreat.  I had been called in to replace a young woman that  was unable to attend because of health reasons, at the last minute.  I know I was there by divine appointment and this was my reward.  It lifts me up at the beginning of each day."
176,0,I exhort you to buy a copy of this wonderful devotional book if you need nurturing in God's word and His purpose for your life.  Suffering is one of the prime targets and why God allows us to suffer.
177,0,"One of my favorite passages from this beloved-by-many devotional tome is on the date February 4 and is about flying into the wind, to overcome its power.  The devotional ends with a little poem paraphrased from Victor Hugo: ""Be like a bird that, halting in its flight, Rests on a bough too slight.  And feeling it give way beneath him sings, Knowing he hath wings."""
178,0,"This devotional book is well-known and has been around for decades.  It has been quoted and/or paraphrased in other publications that share spirituality through strength, hope and experience.  At first glance, the stories may seem old-fashioned and too long.  I suggest reading some of the longer pages as literature then give yourself a moment to pause.  During that important pause, you will more likely than not experience an unforgettable ""Aha!"" moment."
179,0,I bought this as a gift for my son and it is a lovely cover but most importantly I discovered that it is the same devotional I have had for over 20 years but in a more updated version i.e. easier to understand English. This makes an inspiring gift for anyone in your list that likes to take time to pray and meditate.  Great price as well.
180,0,"I keep several of these devotional on hand at all times to give to people who are going thru rough times whether it is illness, loss or just plain hard times.  It really is the stream in the desert.  I've never read another devotional like it.  So uplifting .  Please order this.... you will be SO glad u did.  I also write excerpts from it in  cards that I send out.  Whenever you don't know what to say, just start flipping through the pages... sometimes I just copy the page or I will make a word document of a certain part in a nice font so I can just print it off and slip it into a card."
181,0,I am a PhD student with major in signal processing and machine learning with applications to neuroimaging data. I must emphasize that the following review is affected by my knowledge and review criteria. So it is somewhat subjective.
182,0,This book may be the newest book on EEG signal processing. It reviewed some newly developed techniques with emphasizing on independent component analysis (ICA). Plenty of references are provided at the end of each chapter.
183,0,"However, compared to many classic books in signal procesisng and EEG fields, I have to give three stars to this book, due to the following reasons:"
184,0,"1) Some contents that are not important are introduced with many pages, while some contents that are important are introduced briefly (note the main body of the book has only 265 pages)."
185,0,"For example, in the 265-page book, the authors use 34 pages to introduce the background, while use half a page (or one or two paragraphs) to introduce some important algorithms which are new to EEG signal processing and have potential applications."
186,0,"Another example. We know that using ICA to detect, separate and classify P300 signals is very important in the history of EEG/ERP processing. There are numerous literature involve it. But the authors give only half a page to state it."
187,0,2) Some algorithms introduced in this book are not complete.
188,0,"Through the description of the book, the reader may not well understand some algorithms, such as the Parallel Factor Analysis (Section 7.3.2), because they are introduced briefly. For some algorithms the definitions of some symbols are missed, such as the algorithm in Section 5.2.4: what's the meaning of Q? And in Section 3.1.3-3.1.4 what's the meaning of r?"
189,0,"For some important algorithms the authors almost directly list the equations of the algorithms without explanation, such as the one in Section 5.2.9. If there is possible for the authors to provide the second edition, I think they should add something important about the algorithms, such as the motivation of algorithms, the key steps in the development of algorithms (eg. the construction of objective function of algorithms), the physical meanings of algorithms, and their performance in practical applications and so on."
190,0,3) The selection of algorithms in each topic is strongly affected by the authors' interest and their published work.
191,0,"For example, in Section 3.1.3-3.1.4 the authors use 7 pages to introduce their work in the ICASSP conference, while leaving lots of important methods (proposed by others) published in other top journals or top conferences unmentioned."
192,0,"Another example: In Section 7.2.1 (Preprocessing of EEG) the authors only introduced their published work, but not introduced others' work. I think in this section some things should be added. For example, there are other preprocessing aspects in addition to artifact removal. Even in artifact removal by ICA, other methods may need to be added such as several kinds of constrained ICA, methods based on higher-order statistics (using ICA as preprocessing and then using conventional methods to remove artifact), and the automatic methods for artifact removal. Especially, the removal of eye artifact may need to be added, because removal of eye artifact is very important for the visual attention experiments."
193,0,"4) Some places in the book may be not clear and may arouse readers' misunderstand, or even wrong."
194,0,"For example, in page 98 the authors said, ""for the EEG mixing model....the propagation velocity is equivalent to that of electromagnetic waves (300,000km/s). Therefore the delay is almost zero and the mixing model can always be considered to be instantaneous (ICA model)"". It's wrong. The delay definitely exists in EEG signals, since the propagation velocity of EEG signals is very very low compared to the electromagnetic waves. And there are some literatures using convolutive ICA to process EEG signals (Neural Computation 2006, Neural Networks 2003, etc)."
195,0,"Another example. In Section 1.2.3 the authors put skewness and kurtosis, which are often seen as measurement of non-Gaussinity in statistics literature, in the subsection of measurement of nonstationarity. Although the authors think the skewness and kurtosis are useful in the measurement of non-stationarity of signals with time-varying distribution, they may need to give clearer explanation, and provide other conventional measurement of nonstationarity (maybe it is necessary to provide the definition of nonstationarity, since there are several definitions of it in signal processing literature)."
196,0,"In summary, the book is absolutely not a textbook, but a long review, such that you may not fully understand algorithms but you can look for original papers to get details according the references provided by the book."
197,0,"I hope the authors can provide the second edition, in which they can balance their work and others' work, balance each contents (important contents and introductory contents), provide more details on algorithms (at least those important algorithms), include more newly developed techniques or important algorithms, and modify some errors. More importantly, they need to carefully exam their manuscript."
198,0,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize."
199,0,"I slogged through, and found the stories engaging, the descriptions of the culture fascinating, and the plotlines very different from western stories. The time invested in completing the series was a joy. Thankfully, a glossary of individual names, relationships, and even the family trees for the families most involved appears in each volume. I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book."
200,0,"It's usually difficult to find all five volumes, so I thank Amazon for pulling the Penguin versions together."
201,0,"Nothing good lasts forever, whether we are talking about the Garden or this novel itself… Volumes 4 and 5 are thought to be written by Gao E a generation after Cao Xueqin’s untimely death.  There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s."
202,0,"Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days."
203,0,"When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point."

206,0,"This is the point where the author had left off and his friends subsequently pieced together his notes and drafts.  The story becomes quickly incredibly depressing, all presaged in the preceding volumes but still.  it is realistically done and vivid but the story, and its characters, lose a lot of their charm.  They pay their debt of tears, with interest."

210,0,I should like to return this book because it is smaller by 1/2 inch in perimeter than the other 4 volumes of the same book I acquired through Amazon.  I'd like the volumes to match in size.

214,0,"I've used computers for years, but my iMac was the first Apple product that I have bought.  Not having grown up using Apple products, I needed some help, and I have found this book quite useful.  It would be a good idea just to work my way through it, but so far I've used it just as a reference tool.  Using it has saved me from a lot of frustration so it was well worth the purchase price."
215,0,Very good find on Amazon. Very comprehensive and I'm sure will come in handy.....at some point. Only giving 4 stars right now because I really haven't had to use it much. Set up for the MAC is pretty straight forward even for a first time user like me. But the Quick Reference Guide a purchased at the same time as this has been very useful and has come in quite handy several times. I almost would recommend buying it over iMac for dummies but if for some reason something should go wrong with the system.....you may need something more comprehensive.
216,0,"This book, unlike ""For Dummies"" books I have read previously, has not been very helpful. It's probably because despite its 2012 copyright date,it's already out of date.I have had my iMac for about 1 1/2  months and it's the latest iMac desktop from Apple.""For Dummies"" describes the many things that the CD/DVD player will do, but the latest iMacs come without the device.There's even an illustration showing the player but  there is not one on the latest iMacs. A CD/DVD player can be purchased as an add-on, but it's not cheap. There are other instances of this but since it is out of date, it's not the author's fault. Not all of the book is out of date, it has been fair overall."
217,0,This book was not helpful. I was a PC user converting to Mac. There is no info on email and data processing which were my main problems. Very disappointed in the content
218,0,"Unfortunately, this book did not cover our newer Mac's High Sierra functions. While much of it is the same, there is just enough difference that a more up to date book is needed, at least for this dummy."
219,0,"After several PC's I decided to try an iMac, and am so glad that I did. This Book really explains all the things that you can do and it's easy to read and understand"
220,0,This is a great reference book to look up a subject about your computer when you haven't used a particular program or short cut for awhile.  It's well written with humor as well.
221,0,It explains the basics...but not all...
222,0,"He pads it out with very juvenile humor and presumably his interpretation of ""cool"" language."
223,0,This is a Mac up-to-date book that is a MUST-HAVE!  Totally informative and easy-to-comprehend.
224,0,The early chapters are just fill.  I was kind of hoping for more about actual use of the mac.  I probably will need to purchase another book for more in depth information.
225,0,"It truly is a challenge to find a well written Christian novel.  I've only found a few and this is one of them. I don't know who the protagonist, Will Chambers, is modeled after or if he's a composite, but I would like to meet him or them! He is a very brilliant, insightful attorney. The story expertly combines Will's natural abilities with God's supernatural interventions, weaving them together to hold the reader's attention until the story is resolved on the final page!"
226,0,"Grabbed from the beginning, this novel held me throughout. If you’re a lesser us better when it comes to government, this will drive you nuts. I found myself so engrossed with the drama unfolding that I began to join in with Will as he fights the system which had gone off the rails. A must read from an author who truly engages his readers."
227,0,"As far as I'm concerned,  Mr. Parshall is #1 in the legal thriller  genre; better than John  Grisham.  He expertly weaves his stories through twists, turns and surprises. This story really carried me quickly through to the end. I read it in one day. I love that he includes Christianity in his books. His faith adds so much depth to the story. I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. As a former legal secretary,  I'm always fascinated by legal thrillers."
228,0,"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall.  As with the first one, this is well done."
229,0,The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse.  There are many twists and turns throughout.  The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.
230,0,"In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues.  The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline.  That part is well done also."
231,0,"I will certainly be checking out more books in this series.  I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."
232,0,This is an excellent thriller series. Lots of action. You will not want to put it down. Read them in order.
233,0,The premise is scary. This is an engrossing book I recommend you read this when you have a lot of time to read it
234,0,"Enjoyed this one as much as the first book in the series.  Holds your interest.  And the characters are very ""real""."
235,0,I look forward to the read. Thanks
236,0,EXCELLENT READ. Would like to believe a lawyer could have this much feeling for jusice and the truth.
237,0,"Of the five books in this series, I've only read the first two.  This book was more enjoyable than the first. I didn't want to put it down."
238,0,This complete version is very nicely edited and printed. Cover design is all good. Free shipment to home is very convenient. Little heavy due the thickness (500 pages) but it's okay if you don't carry it in your journey or in your dreams.
239,0,"I recently purchased this book because I've read it in the past and will need to make reference to it (though I have pretensions of scholarship, this is not a scholarly review!).  I enjoy reading everything written by Anthony Yu.  In _Re-Reading_ I appreciate his detailed analysis and his direct comment on religious elements in Honglou Meng (Dream of the red chamber).  Anthony Yu is willing to take on the broad community of scholars to make his particular points of emphasis and in Re-Reading I feel he especially allows for a closer sympathy to the characters of the novel and their engagement with their own destinies.  Some may feel the theory to be a little steep but I feel the whole discussion helps me personally to work through what I see in the novel."
240,0,"I was very late to the Harry Potter rush.  When I had initially heard about the ""little kids books"" involving Harry Potter, I thought Potter was the author.  Only once the movie came out did I start reading the books.  I literally couldn't put them down.  I read all 4 books in about 3 weeks total.  I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway."
241,0,"Trust me, these books are absolutely fantastic!  As long as you're between the ages of 4 and 114, you will love them!"
242,0,What do you think would happen if somebody in your school gets pulled into a chamber that hasn't been opened in a long time? What if you got pulled in and everybody was sure you were going to die? Would you be terrified?
243,0,"After returning to Hogwarts for the second year, Harry Potter wanted to find out what's happening to Hogwarts. Mysterious words in what appears to be blood are written on the walls. Nobody knows who is making it happen or how. People are getting worried that something really bad is going to happen. Sadly, they are right. In the staff room Harry Potter and Ron find out more about the chamber of secrets. Harry, Ron, and a professor from Hogwarts enter the chamber of secrets.  Harry has to face the worst person he could ever think of. Will he be able to survive?"
244,0,"I think that this is a great book because you can always picture what's happening in the story, and you can picture what the characters are doing. J.K. Rowling describes just about everything the characters see or do. You also never want to put the book down because the events keep on surprising you. You never know when something is going to happen, plus the story suspenseful. The series is amazing. Every book in the series connects to this book. The series hooks you in the beginning and you can't resist reading the next book in the series."
245,0,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second book in the series. It is a great book for ages 9+ and will take in its own little magical world. This is a must read book and I hope you enjoy it!
246,0,"The Harry Potter series is the is the must have book of the century! Harry Potter is the best series that I have ever read and will probably BE the best series I'll ever read! Harry is a young boy that discovers on his tenth birthday that he is a wizard. He goes through massive adventures and makes life long friends along the way. This book (written by J.K. Rowling) is the and will be the best series ever! If you think that it's ""over priced"" then you're wrong. This series is under priced. The Harry Potter book is read by adults that should be reading the dictionary! Even though this is a fourth grade reading level this book should be read by every grade. This book is the ruler of classics. This book features conflicts, friendships, comedy, adventure, mystery that will only be solved if you read the whole book. It wouldn't surprise me if a detective had a problem solving this book, and fantasy that makes you wish you didn't live in this world but in theirs because the description is just right so that you can picture it but not get bored. Love is another huge thing in this book. The relationships in this book not only surprise you, but they also change right as you think you know what is going on. After you read this series you will never be able to compare anything to this book. If you read this book, then you will never be able to read another book without feeling left out of excitement! After you read this series then you will never feel disappointed by this series. If you didn't enjoy this book then you have to give it another chance. HARRY POTTER RULES!"
247,0,"Harry Potter is not your ordinary boy. He doesn't go to your ordinary school or hang out with your average friends. Instead he goes to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry, and hangs out with other wizards and witches at school. He is at his second year of Hogwarts when strange things start to happen including messages warning the heir that the Chamber of  Secrets have been opened. He even stumbles over the diary of  Tom Riddle that writes back to him and takes him back to the past. Will Harry be safe at Hogwarts? Later on  Harry goes into the Chamber of Secrets and saves Ron's little sister, Ginny, after fighting a enormous basilisk summoned by Tom Riddle who lured Ginny into coming. I would recommend this book to anybody, old or young, because this book and series is very interesting and makes the reader never want to put the book down."
248,0," I like the main characters in this book because they are very intelligent and logical. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all are very smart and good at solving puzzles. In the first book they all went through the puzzles and test to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. In this book they all put in to solving this mystery. They are very sneaky because numerous times they snuck out of Hogwarts and got Hagrid to give them some information that he shouldn't have."
249,0, I also like the setting in this book. This book takes place at a school for witches and wizards. They have many classes like potion classes and defense against the dark arts classes. Although it may be dangerous at times it is a perfectly fine institution. The people and things at Howgwarts made it possible for Harry to rescue Ron's sister and fight the basilisk.
250,0," Finally I like the problem and the way it was introduced. The way the plot was introduced was almost like a mystery by itself because the clues led to the problem. First Dobby came to Harry's house to keep him from coming to school. Second, Harry gets hurt badly. Then bodies start to be found in Hogwarts petrified. Harry also finds the diary and then finds out that Ginny has gone into the Chamber of Secrets. The problem is to find out who has opened the Chamber of Secrets and how all these people are getting petrified. It is resolved by Harry going into the Chamber of Secrets to meet Tom Riddle and Dumbledore's Phoenix kills the basilisk."
251,0, Harry Potter and the Chamber os Secrets is a very interesting book that keeps readers of all levels interested. It has mystery and adventure which makes this book a great read for anybody.

256,0,My Opinion
257,0,"  I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good book. I think that because the plot of the story is amazing. I also think J.K Rowling did an excellent job on righting the book because she didn't leave any details out. The book is better than alot of other books because you are able to picture the scene in your mind. Harry Potter is a good book for kids around eight or older because in some parts it could be pretty scary.  Even though most of my friends read this book, I would defiantly recommend this book to any one else. The Harry Potter book series probably did such a good job selling the books because there are not many good books with suspense and magic. That's why I would recommend this book to others."
258,0,"I think the story was great because it was very exciting. It kept me turning the pages and reading as fast as I could. It took me a month and a half becuase I was busy with required school reading from Mr. Schrader. This book is the second in the fantasy genre series by J.K. Rowling.  The series main character is Harry Potter.  He is an orphan who finds himself with magical powers and an invitation to Hogwarts, a special school for wizards. I enjoy Harry as a character because he is adventurous, he never gives up, and is courageous in the face of danger although he may feel fear.The story takes place mostly at Hogwarts during Harry's second year.  One of my favorite parts was when Harry and Ron flew the car to Hogwarts and they land in the Whomping Willow. Another exciting part was when Harry talks to the snake at the Dueling Club and found out that he was a parcel toungue, one who has special powers to talk to snakes. Harry and his friends spend most of the book trying to find out who is opening the chamber of secrets and what secrets the chamber holds. Near the end the plot thickens when Harry most save Ron's sister Ginny from the giant snake Basilisk. To find out what happen, you'll have to read the book. I enjoy J.K. Rowlings writing style because it is descriptive, allows my imagination to run wild, and how she builds anticipation and surprises in her books for her readers. Another author in this genre that I would recommend is J.R.R. Tolkien."
259,0,"J.K. Rowling managed to write a book, which soon became a national phenomenon read by children of all ages. Her masterpieces have captured the imagination of children all around the world. These books are about a regular boy living in the Muggle world, growing up, and descovering new worlds of magic, and things that he thought only existed in dreams. This hero, who has managed to overcome his almost deadly experiances with Voldemort, is just a regular kid. For his definition of ""regular"" is completely different. Where he comes from, he is just as regular as anyone else. These books shall capture the readers' attension by revealing adventures, mythological creatures, and three best friends, who keep getting into trouble, but become hero's again. The Sorcerer's Stone is a story of a boy, growing up with a miserable life, and with miserable people. But such a shock comes to him, when his identity is completely revealed (or so he thinks) The Chamber of secrets, has more mythology in it, more dark, evil, and more adventurous material, that has the reader begging for more. The Prisoner of Azkaban, is another great sequel, with just as much adventures as the first two. The Goblet of Fire, best yet. Has the most adventures in it. Mer-people, veela, death-eaters, and much more within. These four books, part of a soon to come seven book series, are the best fantasy, adventure, and best books, that you can ever imagine."

I didnt know that, that book exists until one day when I went to work with my mom her boss told me is a great book so I decicded to read it. Well lets begin with the overview of Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets. Harry Potter attended Hogwarts School of Wirchcraft And Wizardy. But,when the school semester was overhe went to live With The Dursleys(with his uncle)family. Harry Potter didn't like it there. Harry Potter was always wondering why his friends never wrote back he tought that his friends had forgot about him but the owl was not delivering the letters.When Harry Potter want it to returned to Hogwarts a little strange creature appear and told him that if he went to Hogwarts again something was going to happend(he was going to make trouble)but Harry didnt believe him and the liitle strange goblin told him why his friends never wrote bsck to him. But,Harry's uncle was always screamin' at him and that is why Harry didnt like it there.His uncle didnt even want his frineds to know that he exists(Harry).Well that's all Im going to say for know so if you read the book you are not going to know what it going to happend next so it could be more exciting.I really like Harry Potter_and the Chamber Of Secrets.

Harry and Ron were almost expelled because some people or �muggles� saw the flying car. Later in the book Harry and his friends walking down the hallway and they saw a dead cat on the wall.

266,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
267,0,This book is superb. I have read the Chinese version. Mr Hawkes' work is not only a translation but a gloss on the original text in modern language albeit in English.
268,0,"This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing."
269,0,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
270,0,"I have now read all three volumes of the David Hawkes' translation of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' and I am simply blown away by the sheer volume of the text, and how there is never a dull moment. Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."
271,0,Don't miss this series.

279,0,"Man oh man, this is one bittersweet book, folks. It's the sunset of an era for the Jia family, and everyone and their dog knows it. Dai-yu, Bao-yu, Xi-feng, and nearly half of the characters are either sick or depressed. Anything not nailed down is being pawned off out the yinyang. Prospect Garden empties out its beautiful girls. Hell-- things are so bad, the servants can't even keep the damn gates locked at night. As Xi-feng bemoans when trying to bean-count the family's way out of bankruptcy, the Jias are slaves to their own past good fortunes and it's about time that the chickens come home to roost."
280,0,"To be frank, it doesn't have the spellbinding whimsy of the The Golden Days, or the splendorous atmosphere of The Crab-Flower Club. What The Warning Voice does have, however, is a helluva mood. True to its spirit of Taoism, the characters are liberated by their own true natures, and entrapped by spider webs of their own design:"
281,0,"In the first half, the girls of Prospect Garden explore their talents, their ambitions, and even their sexualities and genders. One girl pretends to be the wife of another girl until it feels real, while one of Bao-yu's servants begins to adopt a male persona. And both are treated with such wonder, sensitivity, and total lack of sensationalism that it sneaks up on you. But all it takes is some jealous and irrational busybodies, and next thing you know -- Bao-yu is wandering an empty garden."
282,0,"I wanted to yell at this book for how it puts these people, who I feel like I've known since they were boys and girls, through terrible misery. At the center of the impending disasters is Dai-yu, because like a flower, she is blooming into something beautiful -- and also very, very, very, VERY not long for this world. Bao-yu, meanwhile, is shaping up to be quite a sensitive, smart, and caring man...just in time to wave goodbye to her."
283,0,"The most bittersweet thing of it all is knowing there's two more volumes, and things must get worse before they get better. And it's bittersweet to move on without David Hawkes as the trusty translator, my companion through this foreign world (I sure hope the next volume explains why he stopped, because half the joy is cross-referencing his translation with the Chinese, and appreciating Hawkes's good sense and creativity). But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."

286,0,"As the SF Opera was featuring an adaptation, I decided to read the Kindle so-called ""abridged"" version of this classic. While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."

289,0,Bad translation. I have heard great things about this story but could not get past the poor translation.
290,0,"Reminds me of Jane Austin. Interesting peak into Chinese society. Well Ming era anyway.The 2nd book maybe better, I hope."
291,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
292,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
293,0,The Hawkes translation 
294,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
295,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
296,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
297,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
298,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
299,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
300,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
301,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
302,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
303,0,"I am an avid reader, approximately 100 books per year on a variety of topics and themes.  I have to say that The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger is one of the most unreadable books I have ever encountered.  I powered through over half of the book before I asked myself;  WTH am I spending my time reading this nonsense.  I will never attempt to finish this book due to the intense boredom of it.  I can't say more than that except don't waste your time."
304,0,"I don't understand the fascination with this series, much less Stephen King.  Most of his books end up with an alien monster.  This one ended up in the trash."
305,0,"Stephen King says he started his epic series, THE DARK TOWER, when he was a very young man. Perhaps with the arrogance and/or enthusiasm of youth this series is a mash-up of any number of literary traditions. In most hands it could have wound up a mess."
306,0,"THE GUNSLINGER, the first in the series, opens, appropriately enough, with “the gunslinger” chasing an unidentified man across a nameless desert:"
307,0,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”"
308,0,"The scene has the look and feel of an old spaghetti western, which King freely admits:"
309,0,“… I realized that what I wanted to write was a novel that contained Tolkien’s sense of quest and magic but set against Leone’s almost absurdly majestic Western backdrop.”
310,0,I think he succeeded:
311,0,"“The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way…”"
312,0,The Gunslinger (eventually we learn is name is Roland – an epic/mythic/heroic name) comes across a mysterious young man who has somehow been transported from (our) contemporary New York to this strange land. No attempt is made at explanation.
313,0,"When Roland comes to a town, we learn that this is post-apocalyptic time in which the world as we know it has been destroyed, possibly though nuclear war. It is a dystopian vision that predates the current popularity of such stories."
314,0,"As the journey continues, old-fashioned magic becomes part of the mix. Also a bit of derring do in the style of Indiana Jones. Also some fantasy in the vein of George R. R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” (“Winter is coming.”)"
315,0,"And, of course, questions of good versus evil are explored."
316,0,Whew.
317,0,"Any type of cross-genre mixing is difficult to do well, much less on an epic scale. I have not even looked at subsequent books in the series in the hopes of being continually surprised when I do read them. I expect this volume is a good launch. If anybody could make it a success it would in the hands of Stephen King."
318,0,Confusion and Unmoored Sufferings
319,0,"While reading this book, it almost seemed like the author was creating confusion and misery for misery and confusion’s sake!  Why would you do that in the first book of a series?  If Stephen King’s name wasn’t on this book, I sincerely doubt most readers would have finished reading it.  That said after completing the book I googled it and found King’s fans encouraging people to “power” through the book because book two is good, while on the same page I found others talking about underage sex that is weird in further editions of the series.  This leads me to one question:"
320,0,"“Why did you create such frivolous misery in your novel Mr. King?”  Apart from Jake, it just seems like pain that neither builds the character, nor furthers the story.  It is, to me, uninteresting and does nothing but sear and jade your reader’s imagination."
321,0,"This book was much less interesting than some less known/self-published smaller authors today like AC Cobble, Peter Flannery, A.G. Riddle and others.  In fact this being the first Stephen King book I’ve ever read, I was left wondering if the only reason he has been so popular was due to the advertisements of his brand over the years.  After all, prior to Amazon a writer could not easily get their works known or published.  I now wonder if King is really deserving of his lofty place amongst well known literary authors."
322,0,"The final quarter of this book from the flashback of Roland’s “coming of age” through the cave onward was decent and even good occasionally, but prior to that I wanted to stop reading the book several times."
323,0,"Maybe my review is unfair, but this doesn’t seem like a work worthy of one of the past century’s most popular authors.  Read it if you must, or just read the cliff’s notes version and save yourself some pointless misery."
324,0,"There are many Stephen King books that I really enjoy (Salems Lot, Finders Keepers, The Stand, 11/22/63 just to name a few . . . in fact, 11/22/63 is one of my all-time favorite books).  As such, I really had high hopes for The Gunslinger.  However, the story line was disjointed, confusing, and not very enjoyable at all.  I kept expecting the flow of the book to smooth-out and become a ""cannot put down"" read.  However, this never occurred.  In the end, I was completely disappointed.  I have heard that other Dark Tower books are much better, but I disliked The Gunslinger so much that I'm not sure I'll read any others."
325,0,Once one of my all time favorite books.
326,0,"Stephen King revised this book and it is TERRIBLE!!!  You get no back story and don’t know who some of the characters are, how they played a roll in Roland’s life, what he went through to get to where he is now. NOTHING!!!  It is terrible!!"
327,0,"In terms of story, this is easily the best volume in the series so far. The characters and setting have so much depth, and we learn much about who they all are and why they've been thrust together on this ongoing, epic journey."
328,0,"And this story FEELS epic, too, as Roland and his band of unlikely heroes traverse miles and miles from the first page to the last. The setting and descriptions are all wonderful - you can see, hear, and smell everything the characters are... for good or ill, because some of the places the characters find themselves in are pretty bleak, to say the least."
329,0,"The only problem is that it ends on a cliffhanger. Which ordinarily, would be cause for an immediate one-star review from me, and a solemn vow to never read another book in the series. But because this is Stephen King, and because I've been mostly happy with the series so far, I'm going to press on and give it another shot."
330,0,"Then, the Kindle Edition I read is riddled with typos. Most of these are probably OCR issuess from scanning a print edition of this book, but it just smacks of plain laziness on the part of the publisher. I've reported them all as ""Quality Issues"" on Amazon."
331,0,"I know these are supposed to be the great Stephen King epic, but after three books and NOTHING happening I give up. I don't even care about the characters and he has spent 3 books developing them. He is constantly making references to the pop culture of the 1980s so I,m guessing in 10 years or so no one will know what he's talking about. There are better books to read I'm done."
332,0,Roland went for a walk in the desert.  He had a mule with no name.  Did he feel good to get out of the rain?  I can't remember  ...  the palaver left me too numb to care for his pain.
333,0,"This might be a useful introduction to an epic series,  but the story does not stand in its own."
334,0,"Reading this series again, after King finally concluded it - and though it's been over a decade since my first reading of the gunslinger's ka-tet, it's like my old friends have been waiting for my return. In this slice of the tale, the other characters start coming into their own and King draws his characters a deeper hue, layering meaning and darkening shadows."
335,0,"It's a tense ride, a fulfilling adventure and page-turner that starts to eat away at your sleeping hours. Be warned, I think these pages are laced with some addictive substance...maybe Eddie's been at it again. I can't stop reading this series."
336,0,"Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding ""Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad."""
337,0,...ah! I love learning about other cultures!
338,0,"But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly (""Who the heck is this person again?"" I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time."
339,0,"Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him)."
340,0,"But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work...."
341,0,...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.
342,0,"This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China (""Red Studies,"" from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, ""A Dream of Red Mansions""). It really should be read by every educated person."
343,0,"  The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however."
344,0,"  I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature."
345,0,"  The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note."
346,0,"  First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women)."
347,0,"  Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses."
348,0,"  Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead."
349,0,"  Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure."
350,0,"  Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others."
351,0,  There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.
352,0,"  Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia."
353,0,"For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West (Americas, Europe) it might be a chore to get interested in this book. The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you. If you're interested in how life was lived in that part of the world, this book will be a masterpiece, as it has been in China itself."
354,0,"One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature.  Five volumes and hundreds of characters. Has a modern feel, despite being more than two hundred years old. Fascinating book."
355,0,"Rank and privilege in 18th century China. The family compound. Relation between relatives and the pecking order. The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs. Subjection of women is rife, but not without protest. This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived.  This is not a history book, it is a novel of customs, more about  what people thought, about respect, subservience and privilege  and mores."
356,0,"One of the 4 classics of Chinese literature, it is a riveting and interesting read! Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature. Highly recommended."
357,0,The book looks very aged/old with yellow pages. Disappointed
358,0,This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature. The English translation here is very good. Even the poetry is well done
359,0,"The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read)."
360,0,A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.
361,0,"Don't buy this edition unless Dover fixes the print quality. Currently the printing of the edition is visibly, albeit subtly pixelated, like they printed with the wrong resolution. I exchanged with Amazon and the second copy was identically pixelated. I will be calling Dover about this."
362,0,This book came in amazing condition! I was very pleased.
363,0,This book is great. Nothing is pixelated. The other buyer must have gotten a defective copy.
364,0,"What a beautiful book. i am happy i followed the recommendation of another reviewer who encourages to get the edition with the original writing language, not the updated lingo. At first I thought this was too laborious to read, having gotten used to reading some other devotionals that I've come to call ""Fast food reads."" This book is a ""sit down restaurant"" read, and once I settled into the idea that I wasnt going to zip through a day's entry, but that it was something to be chewed on, kind of like how cows chew cud and ruminate, lol, then I began to cherish the depth of expression in this book. I have since bought two more as gifts. A timeless collection of writings with enough hidden in it for many readings."
365,0,"clear, beautiful insightful messages from multiple saints. With so many terrible devotions out there like 'Jesus calling', this and 'my utmost for his highest', remain two classic timeless devotions. They do NOT present as if Jesus was talking which is the main problem with many others. When he died He said ""It is finished"" When God speaks to me it is not my place to go sell that word to the world but to act on it and be obedient. What these classic devotions like Streams in the Dessert do are present insights and thoughts based on Biblical truths but not in the disguise of God's own words!"
366,0,I ordered this for a friend who lost her husband. I have a paperback version in my car that I read on my lunch hour. It is very dog eared and worn and written in and underlined. In the busy work day it's wonderful to have a break and get back in the Word. There is a verse and then writing. Encouraging and filled with hope. I also sent my brother in another State a copy as he is going through tough times. It is great for all seasons of your life. It is a daily devotional and I have gone through it several years -- but each year is a little different than the prior year as far as your life circumstances.
367,0,"One of my favorite features of this updated edition of Streams in the Desert are the enhancements added by the editor. The enhancements by the editor include referencing Scripture quotes and three different indexes (Contributor, Scripture, and Subject). My favorite enhancement is the subject index. This makes it easy to look up topics of interest and find relevant devotionals. While technically this book is supposed to be a ""daily"" devotional (one per day), I like to use it as a reference as well to jump around different sections and read whatever I happen to be interested in at the time. I believe this updated, edited edition is well worth purchasing due to the value added."
368,0,"Before this book, I had only tried a devotional or two on my Bible app...could never stick with it. I heard good things about Streams In The Desert, so I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did. I love having a physical copy to read everyday (as opposed to just reading daily devotionals from my phone) and personally love the modernized text of this edition. I use the SOAP bible study method with each entry and that really helps me to understand it. I love this devotional so much and can't wait to get some copies for my family."
369,0,"I have loved this book for over thirty years and used is year after year. No matter what is going on in my life, the devotion speaks me it and lifts me up.  I got this one as a gift for a friend who has been going through very difficult problems in several areas of her life and I hoped it would be a help to her as it has been to me for so long."
370,0,"The best on the market.  I receive God's direction daily, as I read from Streams In The Desert.  It is so relevant to what God is doing in my life.  This was a gift to someone that had invited me to a Bible Study, 30 years ago, when my husband had been murdered."
371,0,"God brought this instrument to me 15 months ago, when I was working a Book Table at a Spiritual Renewal Retreat.  I had been called in to replace a young woman that  was unable to attend because of health reasons, at the last minute.  I know I was there by divine appointment and this was my reward.  It lifts me up at the beginning of each day."
372,0,I exhort you to buy a copy of this wonderful devotional book if you need nurturing in God's word and His purpose for your life.  Suffering is one of the prime targets and why God allows us to suffer.
373,0,"One of my favorite passages from this beloved-by-many devotional tome is on the date February 4 and is about flying into the wind, to overcome its power.  The devotional ends with a little poem paraphrased from Victor Hugo: ""Be like a bird that, halting in its flight, Rests on a bough too slight.  And feeling it give way beneath him sings, Knowing he hath wings."""
374,0,"This devotional book is well-known and has been around for decades.  It has been quoted and/or paraphrased in other publications that share spirituality through strength, hope and experience.  At first glance, the stories may seem old-fashioned and too long.  I suggest reading some of the longer pages as literature then give yourself a moment to pause.  During that important pause, you will more likely than not experience an unforgettable ""Aha!"" moment."
375,0,I bought this as a gift for my son and it is a lovely cover but most importantly I discovered that it is the same devotional I have had for over 20 years but in a more updated version i.e. easier to understand English. This makes an inspiring gift for anyone in your list that likes to take time to pray and meditate.  Great price as well.
376,0,"I keep several of these devotional on hand at all times to give to people who are going thru rough times whether it is illness, loss or just plain hard times.  It really is the stream in the desert.  I've never read another devotional like it.  So uplifting .  Please order this.... you will be SO glad u did.  I also write excerpts from it in  cards that I send out.  Whenever you don't know what to say, just start flipping through the pages... sometimes I just copy the page or I will make a word document of a certain part in a nice font so I can just print it off and slip it into a card."
377,0,"I'm a big fan of both authors, so I was hugely disappointed with this book. It was both the characters & the ending that I did not like. Instead of finding Jordana to be an exciting, independent woman for the time period, I thought she was manipulative and self-serving in her actions, never considering the repercussions of her actions on other people. She had a singlemindedness about her that was not admirable because of the way she went about getting what she wanted, while confessing God's leading & protection. Her bullying of her older brother came off as disrespectful & mean, which was disturbing. The story of her older sister in CA drug on endlessly with both husband & wife repeating the same litany of complaints, without trusting God or each other with their burdens. I got tired of reading about them. I did enjoy & respect Jordana's brother & their new friend, Caitlyn. Adding to my dissatisfaction with the book, was getting to the end, only to find NO resolution to any of the main characters stories!"
378,0,"Rarely do I remove a book from my device, but this one is now gone."
379,0,"The biggest surprise in this book was that it didn't end!  Oh, there were no more pages to read . . . but none of the plot lines were resolved.  It ""ended"" in the middle.  I don't like being taken advantage of in this way and for this reason alone, I won't read any more in the series.  Normally, I love a series because I fall in love with the characters as I did with this book.  But I expect each book to also stand on its own.  This one doesn't."
380,0,So it's done  . . . and I'm done.
381,0,"I have read and enjoyed books by both authors, so I had high hopes for this novel.  I found this volume disappointing on many fronts.  The action took place across the US, with subjects ranging from the Civil War, the Transcontinental Railroad, Westward expansion,  and the photographic processes of the time period.  I thought the pacing was uneven, and sluggish for the most part.  The characters were fairly engaging,  but I felt that none of them were really well developed.  All seemed to have major trouble with communicating their needs and feelings.  There were multiple plot lines and NONE were fully resolved at the conclusion of this novel.  Even so, the ending felt contrived and I had a hard time believing that parents in that time period would be supportive of the choices their children made at the conclusion.  (This comment is vague intentionally so as not to be a spoiler)"
382,0,"I felt that the authors would have served their characters (and readers )better had they chosen to focus on one set of characters at a time, and had at least one plot line reach a satisfying conclusion in each novel.  The choices they have made impel the reader to buy multiple volumes in order to have any resolution.  This strategy failed in my case, as I just don't care what happens next to any of these characters."
383,0,Content Review:
384,0,Sex:none
385,0,Cursing: none
386,0,Violence: fistfights and gunshots
387,0,"Religion : prayer and trust in God mentioned often, but no strong statements of faith in Christ  or Salvation message."
388,0,There were two major stories in this book...
389,0,"1) Caitlan, an 18 year old Irish girl is sent away from home and a potentially nasty situation to America where her much older brother is living. A letter to Brenton and Jordana Baldwin (brother and sister, who's parents are in Russia for an extended work related stay) lets them know she will be arriving by ship soon to NYC, where they live. This was such a surprise, but they soon become fast friends, even though the difference in their social status is huge. It makes no difference to the wealthy brother and sister, but Caitlan, of the very poor working class feels the difference and will not take their offerings of lodging, so sets out to work as a chamber maid at another home. Eventually they all set off for a trek across America to find her brother in California. Now, mind you, it's during the Civil war and the three of them are 19, 16, and 18. Yikes. So that's the first story, the three young folk making their way through cities on trains with Brenton's photography gear, until there are no more rails, where at that point a wagon and horses are purchased to make their way across the plains and mountains, um, alone. Again, yikes."
390,0,"The second story is of Caitlan's brother, Kiernan and his wife Victoria, who is Brenton and Jordana's older sister. Kiernan, a handsome charming, hard working Irish lad, lost Victoria's fortune after they married when they went to California to mine gold. They move from place to place, barely scraping by, eating meagerly, but are very much in love. Little do they know (it is the 1860’s, and it's not like they can just view an email) his sister is escaping a bad situation and headed their way. They have no idea where she is, nor how to reach her, nor when she might get there, nor where she thinks she might meet them, since she doesn't even know where they are. Yep... yikes!"
391,0,Lots of exciting stories and events happen in both stories.
392,0,"I think this may be my favorite Judith Pella/Tracie Peterson book so far. I'd almost given up on their books because I was becoming less and less a fan. But the writing is good, and it truly keeps your interest. Although all the talk about railroads was boring to me, it was easy to skip a few paragraphs at a time to pick back up on the story a bit later."
393,0,"The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that this is not a full book. I may not have picked it up if I had known that, because now I don't know what happens to the three young people who have been traveling for over a year and are only about half way across the country. But it was a good book and well written, and you will want to find out what happens to the groups, which is the point isn't it?"
394,0,"After reading a couple of completely amateur freebie Westerns, tucking into this one proved to be pure delight. It brilliantly brings to life the early days of the Civil War from the viewpoint of young New Yorkers. A highlight was the young man's struggle with complex issues of enlisting. The plot treats the reader to a look inside the home of the Vanderbilts and high New York Society and the challenges and thrills of traveling West in wartime. A less engaging subplot follows the struggles of a California miner who  fritters away his wife's fortune and the repetitive narrative of their marital woes. This was but loosely engaged to the main plot and might better have been saved for a different volume."
395,0,"At times the writing sank toward the pedantic. Many pages are wasted with characters struggling over the same issues in their heads rather than living them in breathtaking action or clever dialog. A great editor should be all over that. Finally, the writers just seemed to pick a spot to stop writing with a small tease for the next volume of the series. If you enjoy a great ride to a breathtaking climax and a settling denouement, you'll not find it here."
396,0,"Judith Pella and Tracie Peterson have done a wonderful job collaborating on this Christian western romance.  We are introduced to the Baldwin family and their adventures in the building of the West in connection with the transpacific railroad.  In this book we learn to love each of the members of the Baldwin family as well as their extended family.  The female protagonist that stands out for me is Jordana.  We see her emerge from an adolescent into a woman.  The authors did a superb job in her character development.  I like the way they used the literary tool of foreshadowing to building the plot line rising action.  For example, when discussing Victoria’s life (the eldest of the Baldwin siblings) in California there is references to the Donner Pass.  Needless to say, if you are a history buff you are aware of the significance of the Donner Pass and the Donner Party.  Tapping into this knowledge makes the reader curious if Victoria’s husband gets caught in this situation.  This is an excellent example of the authors’ writing skills in keeping and maintaining the reader’s interest.  In addition, the author’s end the story at the correct point as now the reader wants to read more about each of these strong and determined characters.  You can’t help but root for their success but you are left with a big question as to what happens next.  Well done."
397,0,"An interesting read of the civil war and the conception of the railroads.  The story covers a couple in California who hunts the gold dream and ends up working for the railroad.  In love but unable to have children cause their marriage to strain, but they manage to hold on, barely."
398,0,"There's also a brother sister duo in New York.  Benton is a photographer who is hired to take pictures of the country, cities near where the railroads will be.  Jordana is finishing school, and has a lot of spunk and actually, she is what keeps the story going.  Then there is Caitlin,  who arrives from Ireland and is supposed to go to the couple in California."
399,0,"Great story line, just nothing is resolved in the end. Not really a cliffhanger, just a bland dead end.  Yet still worth reading if you are into the American civil war era and the railroads."
400,0,"Volume of a trilogy written about the railroad system being built from east to west. It is centered around an expansive family full if colorful characters. There is much history interspersed throughout the book alongside enjoyable romantic musings. The story is told from two different POV’s: a young brother and sister (late teens -20) plus Irish sister-in-law from the east AND an older married couple (but still young - late 20’s/early 30’s) already in California. As the story bounces back and forth, it does so quite easily and the reader begins to see the need for additional volumes...I’m off to start #2 right now!"
401,0,"I usually enjoy Tracie Peterson, but I struggled with continuing to read  this book.  Two characters continually repeated the same thoughts, one character was foolish, continuing to behave recklessly all the while claiming  God would protect her.  Twice I set the book aside, reading something else.  I persevered thinking I would find out what happened to at least some of the characters, but NO, it's a cliffhanger.  You have to buy the next book for ten dollars and hope you find out how it ends."
402,0,"The book started out rather stilted and improbable, and I almost quit reading it.  But then, suddenly, it came alive and I was caught up into the edge-of-my-chair adventure along with the compelling, completely believable characters and could not put the book down.  I liked the ending, and look forward to discovering where the story goes in the next book."
403,0,It is so good to find clean books that sweep me along on fascinating journeys.
404,0,I bought this for a friend after reading my copy of the 1975 (I think) edition with the pages turning yellow. It's like medicine. Everyone who struggles with the idea that God is a God of love should read this. Excellent Biblical perspective on how God's love can be known even in the painful experiences of life. Why God's love isn't obvious on the basis of casual observation. Impossible to understand without faith in Jesus Christ.
405,0,"I feel like this is a preacher who is preaching the deep, meat of the Lord's heart.....Oswald Chambers is my favorite!  Every paragraph has a compelling and truthful thought."
406,0,Oswald Chambers teachings are always challenging but the challenge is always good to bring us back to the word of God.
407,0,Fabulous book. I've read it three times and keep reading it. Oswald Chambers was really a wonderful godly man. Very deep
408,0,Oswald chambers has taught me a depth of the he bible that has been astoundingly beautiful. He is the one person including his precious wife that I can't wait tp see I'm heaven. His love of Christ and his devotion to our Lord is sweet fragrance of heaven!
409,0,As usual Oswald makes you think!!
410,0,Anything O Chambers writes is dynamite
411,0,Great amounts of wisdom in this book. Oswald never disappoints with his writing. Definitely worth a read and definitely a book I will read multiple times throughout life!
412,0,"Awesome book, and anything Oswald Chambers writes is annointed by the Holy Spirit. You will see a man dying to flesh to write HIS heart out."
413,0,I love anything by Oswald Chambers and it makes an excellent gift for anyone that needs an insight to the word of God.
414,0,"I am an avid reader, approximately 100 books per year on a variety of topics and themes.  I have to say that The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger is one of the most unreadable books I have ever encountered.  I powered through over half of the book before I asked myself;  WTH am I spending my time reading this nonsense.  I will never attempt to finish this book due to the intense boredom of it.  I can't say more than that except don't waste your time."
415,0,"I don't understand the fascination with this series, much less Stephen King.  Most of his books end up with an alien monster.  This one ended up in the trash."
416,0,"Stephen King says he started his epic series, THE DARK TOWER, when he was a very young man. Perhaps with the arrogance and/or enthusiasm of youth this series is a mash-up of any number of literary traditions. In most hands it could have wound up a mess."
417,0,"THE GUNSLINGER, the first in the series, opens, appropriately enough, with “the gunslinger” chasing an unidentified man across a nameless desert:"
418,0,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”"
419,0,"The scene has the look and feel of an old spaghetti western, which King freely admits:"
420,0,“… I realized that what I wanted to write was a novel that contained Tolkien’s sense of quest and magic but set against Leone’s almost absurdly majestic Western backdrop.”
421,0,I think he succeeded:
422,0,"“The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way…”"
423,0,The Gunslinger (eventually we learn is name is Roland – an epic/mythic/heroic name) comes across a mysterious young man who has somehow been transported from (our) contemporary New York to this strange land. No attempt is made at explanation.
424,0,"When Roland comes to a town, we learn that this is post-apocalyptic time in which the world as we know it has been destroyed, possibly though nuclear war. It is a dystopian vision that predates the current popularity of such stories."
425,0,"As the journey continues, old-fashioned magic becomes part of the mix. Also a bit of derring do in the style of Indiana Jones. Also some fantasy in the vein of George R. R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” (“Winter is coming.”)"
426,0,"And, of course, questions of good versus evil are explored."
427,0,Whew.
428,0,"Any type of cross-genre mixing is difficult to do well, much less on an epic scale. I have not even looked at subsequent books in the series in the hopes of being continually surprised when I do read them. I expect this volume is a good launch. If anybody could make it a success it would in the hands of Stephen King."
429,0,Confusion and Unmoored Sufferings
430,0,"While reading this book, it almost seemed like the author was creating confusion and misery for misery and confusion’s sake!  Why would you do that in the first book of a series?  If Stephen King’s name wasn’t on this book, I sincerely doubt most readers would have finished reading it.  That said after completing the book I googled it and found King’s fans encouraging people to “power” through the book because book two is good, while on the same page I found others talking about underage sex that is weird in further editions of the series.  This leads me to one question:"
431,0,"“Why did you create such frivolous misery in your novel Mr. King?”  Apart from Jake, it just seems like pain that neither builds the character, nor furthers the story.  It is, to me, uninteresting and does nothing but sear and jade your reader’s imagination."
432,0,"This book was much less interesting than some less known/self-published smaller authors today like AC Cobble, Peter Flannery, A.G. Riddle and others.  In fact this being the first Stephen King book I’ve ever read, I was left wondering if the only reason he has been so popular was due to the advertisements of his brand over the years.  After all, prior to Amazon a writer could not easily get their works known or published.  I now wonder if King is really deserving of his lofty place amongst well known literary authors."
433,0,"The final quarter of this book from the flashback of Roland’s “coming of age” through the cave onward was decent and even good occasionally, but prior to that I wanted to stop reading the book several times."
434,0,"Maybe my review is unfair, but this doesn’t seem like a work worthy of one of the past century’s most popular authors.  Read it if you must, or just read the cliff’s notes version and save yourself some pointless misery."
435,0,"There are many Stephen King books that I really enjoy (Salems Lot, Finders Keepers, The Stand, 11/22/63 just to name a few . . . in fact, 11/22/63 is one of my all-time favorite books).  As such, I really had high hopes for The Gunslinger.  However, the story line was disjointed, confusing, and not very enjoyable at all.  I kept expecting the flow of the book to smooth-out and become a ""cannot put down"" read.  However, this never occurred.  In the end, I was completely disappointed.  I have heard that other Dark Tower books are much better, but I disliked The Gunslinger so much that I'm not sure I'll read any others."
436,0,Once one of my all time favorite books.
437,0,"Stephen King revised this book and it is TERRIBLE!!!  You get no back story and don’t know who some of the characters are, how they played a roll in Roland’s life, what he went through to get to where he is now. NOTHING!!!  It is terrible!!"
438,0,"In terms of story, this is easily the best volume in the series so far. The characters and setting have so much depth, and we learn much about who they all are and why they've been thrust together on this ongoing, epic journey."
439,0,"And this story FEELS epic, too, as Roland and his band of unlikely heroes traverse miles and miles from the first page to the last. The setting and descriptions are all wonderful - you can see, hear, and smell everything the characters are... for good or ill, because some of the places the characters find themselves in are pretty bleak, to say the least."
440,0,"The only problem is that it ends on a cliffhanger. Which ordinarily, would be cause for an immediate one-star review from me, and a solemn vow to never read another book in the series. But because this is Stephen King, and because I've been mostly happy with the series so far, I'm going to press on and give it another shot."
441,0,"Then, the Kindle Edition I read is riddled with typos. Most of these are probably OCR issuess from scanning a print edition of this book, but it just smacks of plain laziness on the part of the publisher. I've reported them all as ""Quality Issues"" on Amazon."
442,0,"I know these are supposed to be the great Stephen King epic, but after three books and NOTHING happening I give up. I don't even care about the characters and he has spent 3 books developing them. He is constantly making references to the pop culture of the 1980s so I,m guessing in 10 years or so no one will know what he's talking about. There are better books to read I'm done."
443,0,Roland went for a walk in the desert.  He had a mule with no name.  Did he feel good to get out of the rain?  I can't remember  ...  the palaver left me too numb to care for his pain.
444,0,"This might be a useful introduction to an epic series,  but the story does not stand in its own."
445,0,"Reading this series again, after King finally concluded it - and though it's been over a decade since my first reading of the gunslinger's ka-tet, it's like my old friends have been waiting for my return. In this slice of the tale, the other characters start coming into their own and King draws his characters a deeper hue, layering meaning and darkening shadows."
446,0,"It's a tense ride, a fulfilling adventure and page-turner that starts to eat away at your sleeping hours. Be warned, I think these pages are laced with some addictive substance...maybe Eddie's been at it again. I can't stop reading this series."
447,0,"I have been reading a great deal of Urban Fantasy, and I was very much up for a change of pace. This really hit the spot, as they say. I felt like the characters were cohesive, complex and shown to the reader from enough angles to make them feel alive and real. While they all spoke in the flowery speech considered polite, it was easy to tell their personalities from their particular speech habits. I am often cut-throat in my reviews about dialogue so it's refreshing to be able to compliment, not critique it in a review."
448,0,"The best thing about this book was not the plot -- because this is a fairly old work the plot has many of the tropes we readers come to expect from this sort of work. They may seem cliched now because so many newer works have aped them. However, the descriptions are astounding -- detailed and precise yet not overlong or exhausting. It always maintains the perfect level to engross and trap the reader but not bore them. The 'movie' in my head was awash with wonderful detail, lush backgrounds and perfect costumes. I really haven't read description this good in a very long time."
449,0,"However, the one thing I didn't care for was the three or four incidents of anachronism stew. Xifeng had a wrist watch centuries before they came into fashion, Baochai had a few too many modernisms in her speech and  the Chinese manners of gift-giving were ignored, possibly to make the work more appropriate for a western audience. If these had not stuck out of the narratives like sudden blotches of bright paint on a somber renaissance portrait, this would have been five stars. UPDATE -- the author has taken the time to address this paragraph in the comments. Please read her replies as they explain a great deal."
450,0,"This is a translation....so there is usually some loss of understanding.  The book is massively long and the names of the characters are very confusing.  In the front of the book they give a geneology map...you've got to be kidding...no way to keep track....just keep on reading.  It does give a great description of the class system, the mores, and the discrimination that was present. However...I found it to be  an exhausting book to read  and I lost interest in the characters"
451,0,One of the best books I've read about China during that time frame. I was able to relate to the different characters even though they were totally out of my frame of reference. I had sympathy for the various chactacters and the author
452,0,Did a very credible job of explaining why they acted the way they did. I always like to think that when I am reading an
453,0,"Historical novel I am learning much about the period, the place, the history, and how it affected those people that lived through it. I will not soon forget this wonderful novel. I am so glad that this author re-wrote this historical novel and made it simpler for the present readers. it must have been a difficult undertaking and I can see from Pauline Chen's impressive degrees that she truly was in a position to write such an intelligent book. Please write more!!!"
454,0,I consider this story a fan fiction based on the original rather than a abridged version of the original considering the number of characters the author either kills off at the beginning or allowed to live till the end.
455,0,The bad: It is written in present tense. Why did the author do this? It makes reading it more awkward. Four stars if it had not been written in present tense. Seems common for debut authors for some reason.
456,0,"The good: It's an interesting, easy to read version of a very long plodding confusing classic. Her version of the ending is mostly believable (except the epilogue!) and the characters are well drawn if perhaps seemingly a bit different from the original."
457,0,"Read this and then read the five volume version, you'll appreciated both more."
458,0,I've been reading various versions and translations of  A Dream of Red Chambers since the mid 70's and approached this book with some trepidation. Well I enjoyed it so much I bought the audio book (which brought came with the extra bonus of learning the correct pronounciation of charactar's names) and have listened several times over which then leads to a re-reading of the original:-)
459,0,BTW a set of unabridged audio books of ADoRC would be worth the expense...
460,0,There were too many characters with names that I couldn't even pretend to sound out. The book was too long then just ended. I did not enjoy this book
461,0,"suggest you read this book of you have an interest in China, it's customs and politics. The love stories may make this book appeal more to women."
462,0,"I think this novel may have been received better had Chen creditted the Red Chamber rather than fashion this book as a retelling. The closed world of a family in standing within the classical world of its Emporors, feels like a peeping with Daiyu into a secret world.  I am intrigued with the linked lives of the women of this world and how they live out their lives often within a few rooms. Despite its failure to stand alone as ""The"" Red Chamber, Chen has brought us to a different way of seeing the world"
463,0,"I have never read Dream of the Red Chamber but decided to pick up this novel as a condensed version of the aforementioned.  Pauline Chen's The Red Chamber is a captivating read from the get-go, especially in that it provides the right balance of historical context while not detracting from the depths of the main characters.  Some may be unhappy at the changes that have been made in this novel, but if it's taken as a separated, individual novel rather than a reworking of the classic, it will prove to be an enjoyable read.  I was caught up in the novel to the point that I was in tears by the end."
464,0,"Descriptive, thought provoking, emotional. Very easy to read and I literally could not put the book down. The names of the characters took a little getting used to, but I soon got familiar with them. Highly recommend."
465,0,"""The notebook"" was ordered for my wife after she saw the movie. She says that she rates it five stars."
466,0,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
467,0,"As the SF Opera was featuring an adaptation, I decided to read the Kindle so-called ""abridged"" version of this classic. While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."
468,0,"Be advised, due to type font it's 3 times as long as regular Kindle books of this size. It take's between 1 and 2 hours to read a chapter and there are 56 of them!"
469,0,"Children's book rather than the authentic, adult version classic. Buyer be ware!"
470,0,Bad translation. I have heard great things about this story but could not get past the poor translation.
471,0,"Reminds me of Jane Austin. Interesting peak into Chinese society. Well Ming era anyway.The 2nd book maybe better, I hope."
472,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
473,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
474,0,The Hawkes translation 
475,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
476,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
477,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
478,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
479,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
480,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
481,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
482,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
483,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
484,0,"I recently purchased this book because I've read it in the past and will need to make reference to it (though I have pretensions of scholarship, this is not a scholarly review!).  I enjoy reading everything written by Anthony Yu.  In _Re-Reading_ I appreciate his detailed analysis and his direct comment on religious elements in Honglou Meng (Dream of the red chamber).  Anthony Yu is willing to take on the broad community of scholars to make his particular points of emphasis and in Re-Reading I feel he especially allows for a closer sympathy to the characters of the novel and their engagement with their own destinies.  Some may feel the theory to be a little steep but I feel the whole discussion helps me personally to work through what I see in the novel."
485,0,"I as a pastor am reading this book to join in with several men in my congregation who are going through it. While I agree with the character qualities listed for a leader, I am struggling with the means to become that type of leader. For me, godly character comes from spending time in the presence of God, not from struggling to attain that character. Self-examination, which is good (see Psalm 139:23-24), should lead us to repentance and worship in the presence of God. It is only in the presence of the greatest good that my heart is transformed to be like Christ, which then gives me the motivation and strength to be the spiritual man I am called to be."
486,0,"I grew up under a theology that stressed holiness by human effort, and it is only after suicidal guilt that I finally began to understand how God transforms us through His grace. Identity must precede activity. This book seems to lay out the correct biblical qualities of a leader, but stresses the wrong means for how to get these qualities. They are not something that can be attained apart from an intimate love relationship with the one who gives them. Spend time with Jesus. Let Him love you. Let His beauty convince you that His ways are better than the other ways of living."
487,0,"A better leadership book is Crawford Loritts book, ""Leadership as Identity."""
488,0,"In the course of reading J. Oswald Sander’s Spiritual Leadership it is fascinating that the Lord brought me to a conversation that contained the usual perception about church leadership. Earlier in the evening a gentleman had expressed interest in being a pastor and then over dinner reiterated that when talk turned to his current work. He expressed a displeasure in his current vocation and so when I asked what type of work he would like, he indicated that in reality he doesn’t like to work which is why being a pastor interested him."
489,0,"Unfortunately spiritual leadership is often thought of in this way. This mindset it both saddening and maddening. It indicates a very low view of not just pastors, but all of those in leadership within the body of Christ and explains why we are content with just warm bodies rather than placing those both qualified and called into positions of leadership. Several years ago I was fortunate enough to read Spiritual Leadership for the first time and have considered it necessary reading for all believers. This month Moody Publishers is offering a redesigned of the updated version released 10 years ago. It’s worth noting that the only versions I have read have been updated and not the original, and in this latest release I see no discernible differences in the text from the 2007 update."
490,0,"Originally put together as a a series of lectures, the book version is both logical and thoughtful. One cannot read the book without appreciating the effort that Sanders has put forward in conveying the material. The author delves deep into the realm of leadership addressing not just qualifications as many are so used to, although Sanders elevates these points to higher integrity than most,  but he also tackles topics such as the pastor’s ability to read, write, and communicate. The final chapters convey the necessity of building up other leaders. Therefore, despite the shortness of the chapters, the material requires time to read because of the need to be both reflective on it and convicted by it. While deep, the points are cleanly made and the path of reading is done in a logical and sequential order so that readers can ponder all aspects of leadership from beginning to end. Therefore, readers can expect the initial chapters to cover qualifications of leadership, who should be a leader, and some basic insights for becoming a leader, while the rest of the book continues to cover the process of leading itself to the eventual stepping aside from leadership and training up others to continue the work."
491,0,"J. Oswald Sanders discussion points can be considered the ABC’s of leadership in that they are (a) advanced, (b) balance, and (c) comprehensive. Sanders conclusions about leadership are advanced beyond basic thinking. Instead, he challenges both modern notions about leadership and conveys just how much is involved in leading God’s people God’s way. Additionally, the author presents many aspects with a very balanced way, avoiding the pitfalls of going to one extreme or the other. For example in discussing essential qualities of leadership he tackles the topic of anger in such a way that shows its necessity, but cautious about unloving anger. Finally, Sanders is comprehensive, covering many topics that are easy to overlook like those mentioned earlier about abilities to read and write or spiritual qualities such as prayer. He also looks at areas that many are prone to put off or avoid, like disqualification, replacing leaders, and training up new ones. Such details combined with an emphasis on biblical authority makes Sanders book an easy recommendation."
492,0,"Perhaps my one complaint is not with Sanders’ teaching at all, but rather with the additions that the publisher and editors have chosen to put further. The updated edition includes questions for discussion, which generally are very appreciative because they stimulate thinking and application. However, the questions are often asked in such a way that suggests that all believers are called to spiritual leadership and seem to ignore whether or not that person has been called to such a position. To be clear, Sanders nowhere advocates this. I have never had access to the first release and so lament my inability to comment upon the editor’s updates and faithfulness to Sanders’ intentions in the original publication."
493,0,"One thing is certain: Sanders has a high regard for spiritual leadership as God’s work. Therefore, he conveys the seriousness with which it must be undertaken. It comes with great costs of energy, patience, pride, and so much more, and the author is certain to convey that to readers so that they understand the importance of spiritual leadership. Because he does this, the book is beneficial for all persons within the body of Christ and not just leaders (or potential leaders). It is a timeless book that has the propensity to be used by God to transform his church if people would invest the time to read it."
494,0,"Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher at no cost to me for the purpose of review. However, my review was not influenced in anyway by outside sources and instead is the result of my own response to the reading of the book (in fact, I did a review of this book several years ago also highly recommending it and my opinion of it has not changed since)."

498,0,Spiritual Leadership showed me a different style of leadership than I learned in the Army and in business.

499,0,"This book was required reading for a Leadership class that I had to take. I am so thankful that it was. Spiritual Leadership is one of the best books ever written on Christian leadership. This book is a timeless classic in teaching the principles of leadership. Spiritual Leadership was written from two series of dynamic messages delivered to Christian Leaders overseas in 1964 and 1966. This is not a how to book; but a book that emphasizes walking in character, integrity, humility, and obedience to the Word of God."
500,0,I really enjoyed reading this book. I plan to continually read this book through out the years to come. It is an excellent guide for any one who is considering becoming a leader. It is spiritually accurate. I wish someone had place this book in my hands or at least told me about this book twenty-five years ago. It would have saved a lot of heartache and unnecessary anxiety on my part.
501,0,"Spiritual Leadership will help educate you on what it takes to be a leader for God. It will help anyone build a foundation to stand upon in any position of leadership in or out of church.  It teaches you how God honors, protects and vindicates those whom he has chosen as His leaders."

504,0,Great read for leaders of large and small groups. Also great read as a member of the congregation in what to look out for or how we can encourage the qualities and methods Sanders speak about in terms of leadership in our churches or study groups.
505,0,Here is a classic but a very solid classic. I enjoyed taking a few teams through this book and actually am making this one of the required readings in our Church Leadership Pipeline.
506,0,A few chapters in this book will get you to examining your own leadership and challenge you in how well you are really doing.
507,0,This is a must read!
508,0,"Sanders’ book is a challenging and exhaustive reference for any believer who aspires to leadership.  It is a difficult read because its pages are packed with concise and critical words of wisdom, and each requires analysis and application to one’s own life.  At the same time, it sets the bar very high for spiritual leaders and calls each of us to another level of achievement.  True spiritual leadership is a high calling that synthesizes natural gifts and abilities and spiritual gifts and abilities into a person who is extremely dedicated and focused."
509,0,"This book is challenging to me in my own ministry, because I am beginning to recognize the hard work that it is to be a true leader.  It is not something to be taken lightly.  I will study the principles and essential qualities posed in this book much more deeply."
510,0,The book is an updated version from 2007. I wanted the original text of the book. The publisher felt the writings were outdated and modern Christians wouldn't understand the archaic references. That's WHY I wanted it. The publisher also made the book gender inclusive. I wanted Sanders' original language so I could be the judge on whether he is taking about 'males' when he says 'man' or the human race.
511,0,I am giving five stars as to not hurt the rating review as I know the content will be excellent once I read the original edition.
512,0,I really enjoyed this audio book. I was reading it concurrently along with the hard copy and it was a nice companion to help me retain what I read. The narrator had great annunciation and inflection. Also great content.
513,0,"I as a pastor am reading this book to join in with several men in my congregation who are going through it. While I agree with the character qualities listed for a leader, I am struggling with the means to become that type of leader. For me, godly character comes from spending time in the presence of God, not from struggling to attain that character. Self-examination, which is good (see Psalm 139:23-24), should lead us to repentance and worship in the presence of God. It is only in the presence of the greatest good that my heart is transformed to be like Christ, which then gives me the motivation and strength to be the spiritual man I am called to be."
514,0,"I grew up under a theology that stressed holiness by human effort, and it is only after suicidal guilt that I finally began to understand how God transforms us through His grace. Identity must precede activity. This book seems to lay out the correct biblical qualities of a leader, but stresses the wrong means for how to get these qualities. They are not something that can be attained apart from an intimate love relationship with the one who gives them. Spend time with Jesus. Let Him love you. Let His beauty convince you that His ways are better than the other ways of living."
515,0,"A better leadership book is Crawford Loritts book, ""Leadership as Identity."""
516,0,"In the course of reading J. Oswald Sander’s Spiritual Leadership it is fascinating that the Lord brought me to a conversation that contained the usual perception about church leadership. Earlier in the evening a gentleman had expressed interest in being a pastor and then over dinner reiterated that when talk turned to his current work. He expressed a displeasure in his current vocation and so when I asked what type of work he would like, he indicated that in reality he doesn’t like to work which is why being a pastor interested him."
517,0,"Unfortunately spiritual leadership is often thought of in this way. This mindset it both saddening and maddening. It indicates a very low view of not just pastors, but all of those in leadership within the body of Christ and explains why we are content with just warm bodies rather than placing those both qualified and called into positions of leadership. Several years ago I was fortunate enough to read Spiritual Leadership for the first time and have considered it necessary reading for all believers. This month Moody Publishers is offering a redesigned of the updated version released 10 years ago. It’s worth noting that the only versions I have read have been updated and not the original, and in this latest release I see no discernible differences in the text from the 2007 update."
518,0,"Originally put together as a a series of lectures, the book version is both logical and thoughtful. One cannot read the book without appreciating the effort that Sanders has put forward in conveying the material. The author delves deep into the realm of leadership addressing not just qualifications as many are so used to, although Sanders elevates these points to higher integrity than most,  but he also tackles topics such as the pastor’s ability to read, write, and communicate. The final chapters convey the necessity of building up other leaders. Therefore, despite the shortness of the chapters, the material requires time to read because of the need to be both reflective on it and convicted by it. While deep, the points are cleanly made and the path of reading is done in a logical and sequential order so that readers can ponder all aspects of leadership from beginning to end. Therefore, readers can expect the initial chapters to cover qualifications of leadership, who should be a leader, and some basic insights for becoming a leader, while the rest of the book continues to cover the process of leading itself to the eventual stepping aside from leadership and training up others to continue the work."

546,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
547,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
548,0,The Hawkes translation 
549,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
550,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
551,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
552,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
553,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
554,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
555,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
556,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
557,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
558,0,"I was very late to the Harry Potter rush.  When I had initially heard about the ""little kids books"" involving Harry Potter, I thought Potter was the author.  Only once the movie came out did I start reading the books.  I literally couldn't put them down.  I read all 4 books in about 3 weeks total.  I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway."

560,0,What do you think would happen if somebody in your school gets pulled into a chamber that hasn't been opened in a long time? What if you got pulled in and everybody was sure you were going to die? Would you be terrified?
561,0,"After returning to Hogwarts for the second year, Harry Potter wanted to find out what's happening to Hogwarts. Mysterious words in what appears to be blood are written on the walls. Nobody knows who is making it happen or how. People are getting worried that something really bad is going to happen. Sadly, they are right. In the staff room Harry Potter and Ron find out more about the chamber of secrets. Harry, Ron, and a professor from Hogwarts enter the chamber of secrets.  Harry has to face the worst person he could ever think of. Will he be able to survive?"
562,0,"I think that this is a great book because you can always picture what's happening in the story, and you can picture what the characters are doing. J.K. Rowling describes just about everything the characters see or do. You also never want to put the book down because the events keep on surprising you. You never know when something is going to happen, plus the story suspenseful. The series is amazing. Every book in the series connects to this book. The series hooks you in the beginning and you can't resist reading the next book in the series."
563,0,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second book in the series. It is a great book for ages 9+ and will take in its own little magical world. This is a must read book and I hope you enjoy it!
564,0,"The Harry Potter series is the is the must have book of the century! Harry Potter is the best series that I have ever read and will probably BE the best series I'll ever read! Harry is a young boy that discovers on his tenth birthday that he is a wizard. He goes through massive adventures and makes life long friends along the way. This book (written by J.K. Rowling) is the and will be the best series ever! If you think that it's ""over priced"" then you're wrong. This series is under priced. The Harry Potter book is read by adults that should be reading the dictionary! Even though this is a fourth grade reading level this book should be read by every grade. This book is the ruler of classics. This book features conflicts, friendships, comedy, adventure, mystery that will only be solved if you read the whole book. It wouldn't surprise me if a detective had a problem solving this book, and fantasy that makes you wish you didn't live in this world but in theirs because the description is just right so that you can picture it but not get bored. Love is another huge thing in this book. The relationships in this book not only surprise you, but they also change right as you think you know what is going on. After you read this series you will never be able to compare anything to this book. If you read this book, then you will never be able to read another book without feeling left out of excitement! After you read this series then you will never feel disappointed by this series. If you didn't enjoy this book then you have to give it another chance. HARRY POTTER RULES!"
565,0,"Harry Potter is not your ordinary boy. He doesn't go to your ordinary school or hang out with your average friends. Instead he goes to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry, and hangs out with other wizards and witches at school. He is at his second year of Hogwarts when strange things start to happen including messages warning the heir that the Chamber of  Secrets have been opened. He even stumbles over the diary of  Tom Riddle that writes back to him and takes him back to the past. Will Harry be safe at Hogwarts? Later on  Harry goes into the Chamber of Secrets and saves Ron's little sister, Ginny, after fighting a enormous basilisk summoned by Tom Riddle who lured Ginny into coming. I would recommend this book to anybody, old or young, because this book and series is very interesting and makes the reader never want to put the book down."
566,0," I like the main characters in this book because they are very intelligent and logical. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all are very smart and good at solving puzzles. In the first book they all went through the puzzles and test to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. In this book they all put in to solving this mystery. They are very sneaky because numerous times they snuck out of Hogwarts and got Hagrid to give them some information that he shouldn't have."
567,0, I also like the setting in this book. This book takes place at a school for witches and wizards. They have many classes like potion classes and defense against the dark arts classes. Although it may be dangerous at times it is a perfectly fine institution. The people and things at Howgwarts made it possible for Harry to rescue Ron's sister and fight the basilisk.
568,0," Finally I like the problem and the way it was introduced. The way the plot was introduced was almost like a mystery by itself because the clues led to the problem. First Dobby came to Harry's house to keep him from coming to school. Second, Harry gets hurt badly. Then bodies start to be found in Hogwarts petrified. Harry also finds the diary and then finds out that Ginny has gone into the Chamber of Secrets. The problem is to find out who has opened the Chamber of Secrets and how all these people are getting petrified. It is resolved by Harry going into the Chamber of Secrets to meet Tom Riddle and Dumbledore's Phoenix kills the basilisk."
569,0, Harry Potter and the Chamber os Secrets is a very interesting book that keeps readers of all levels interested. It has mystery and adventure which makes this book a great read for anybody.

At Ron's house they use Floo Powder to go to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies.  When Harry and Ron try to get on the Hogwarts Express, the barrier is closed.  Then they get Ron's dad's flying car and fly it to Hogwarts.  They get in trouble for flying the car but all of the kids think it was cool.  When Harry is in detention he hears a voice that says ""Kill, Kill.""  No one else hears the voice though.  After Nearless Headless Nick's Deathday Party, they see writing on the wall that says, ""The chamber of secrets has been opened.""  At the Quidditch match, Harry breaks him arm and has to go to the hospital wing.  Then Harry and Ron drink a potion that makes them look like Draco Malfoy;s best friends.  They want to find out what Draco knows about the chamber.  In the bathroom, Harry finds a diary.  He writes in it and his writing disappears and some else's writing appears.  Harry time travels through the diary back to when the chamber of secrets was first opened.  It appeared that Hagrid had opened the chamber and the monster inside was his giant spider named Aragog.  Harry and Ron go into the Forbidden Forest to find Aragog.  When they find him, he controls a lot more spiders to attack Harry and Ron.  They make it back to the school safely.  When they get back, they figure out that the entrance into the Chamber of Secrets is in the girls bathroom.  Professor McGonagall tells them that Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, is inside the chamber. To find out what happens you will need to read this book. It is a very good book."
572,0,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is about a boy named Harry Potter. It's his second year at Hogwarts but his mean Aunt and Uncle wont let him go to his magic school. So his best friend Ron Weasley comes and pretty much kidnaps him. Harry is very happy with Ron's family because they care about him.
573,0, Once Ron and Harry get to Hogwarts they have a mystery on their hands because there is a monster on the loose. When they here about the monster they want to go see the action up close so they go looking for the Chamber of Secrets were the monster lives. To see if they find the monster and how the chamber was opened you will have to read the book.
574,0,My Opinion
575,0,"  I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good book. I think that because the plot of the story is amazing. I also think J.K Rowling did an excellent job on righting the book because she didn't leave any details out. The book is better than alot of other books because you are able to picture the scene in your mind. Harry Potter is a good book for kids around eight or older because in some parts it could be pretty scary.  Even though most of my friends read this book, I would defiantly recommend this book to any one else. The Harry Potter book series probably did such a good job selling the books because there are not many good books with suspense and magic. That's why I would recommend this book to others."
576,0,"I think the story was great because it was very exciting. It kept me turning the pages and reading as fast as I could. It took me a month and a half becuase I was busy with required school reading from Mr. Schrader. This book is the second in the fantasy genre series by J.K. Rowling.  The series main character is Harry Potter.  He is an orphan who finds himself with magical powers and an invitation to Hogwarts, a special school for wizards. I enjoy Harry as a character because he is adventurous, he never gives up, and is courageous in the face of danger although he may feel fear.The story takes place mostly at Hogwarts during Harry's second year.  One of my favorite parts was when Harry and Ron flew the car to Hogwarts and they land in the Whomping Willow. Another exciting part was when Harry talks to the snake at the Dueling Club and found out that he was a parcel toungue, one who has special powers to talk to snakes. Harry and his friends spend most of the book trying to find out who is opening the chamber of secrets and what secrets the chamber holds. Near the end the plot thickens when Harry most save Ron's sister Ginny from the giant snake Basilisk. To find out what happen, you'll have to read the book. I enjoy J.K. Rowlings writing style because it is descriptive, allows my imagination to run wild, and how she builds anticipation and surprises in her books for her readers. Another author in this genre that I would recommend is J.R.R. Tolkien."
577,0,"J.K. Rowling managed to write a book, which soon became a national phenomenon read by children of all ages. Her masterpieces have captured the imagination of children all around the world. These books are about a regular boy living in the Muggle world, growing up, and descovering new worlds of magic, and things that he thought only existed in dreams. This hero, who has managed to overcome his almost deadly experiances with Voldemort, is just a regular kid. For his definition of ""regular"" is completely different. Where he comes from, he is just as regular as anyone else. These books shall capture the readers' attension by revealing adventures, mythological creatures, and three best friends, who keep getting into trouble, but become hero's again. The Sorcerer's Stone is a story of a boy, growing up with a miserable life, and with miserable people. But such a shock comes to him, when his identity is completely revealed (or so he thinks) The Chamber of secrets, has more mythology in it, more dark, evil, and more adventurous material, that has the reader begging for more. The Prisoner of Azkaban, is another great sequel, with just as much adventures as the first two. The Goblet of Fire, best yet. Has the most adventures in it. Mer-people, veela, death-eaters, and much more within. These four books, part of a soon to come seven book series, are the best fantasy, adventure, and best books, that you can ever imagine."
578,0,"Harry Potter - And the chamber of secrets is a great book. I didnt know that, that book exists until one day when I went to work with my mom her boss told me is a great book so I decicded to read it. Well lets begin with the overview of Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets. Harry Potter attended Hogwarts School of Wirchcraft And Wizardy.

But,Harry's uncle was always screamin' at him and that is why Harry didnt like it there.His uncle didnt even want his frineds to know that he exists(Harry).Well that's all Im going to say for know so if you read the book you are not going to know what it going to happend next so it could be more exciting.I really like Harry Potter_and the Chamber Of Secrets. It is reall funny too.I hope you enjoy it."
579,0,"Do you like mystery, adventure, and action? Then feast your eyes on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling .The protagonist is a boy named Harry Potter who lives with his foster parents, the Dursley�s. They are very mean to him and don�t care much about him. This book is packed with chills and thrills. This is Harry�s second year in Hogwarts. But he is admonished not to go because something terrible is going to happen. But like always, Harry is so undaunted he goes."
580,0, When Harry and his friend Ron got to the train station an invisible wall blocked the entrance. Each time they tried to get through they were knocked down.
581,0," So Harry and Ron stole their parent�s car and flew to Hogwarts. When they arrived, their potions teacher, Snape, punished them. Harry and Ron were almost expelled because some people or �muggles� saw the flying car. Later in the book Harry and his friends walking down the hallway and they saw a dead cat on the wall. On the wall it said the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Children were then found frozen solid in the hallways or petrified."
582,0, What could be doing this and why? Is the Chamber of Secrets really open? If you want to find out anymore the go read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K.  Rowling.
583,0,"This is a Chinese classic, which is nicely translated to English. It's an interesting story and provides a glimpse into aristocratic culture in 18th century China."
584,0,"It's a little hard to read, with a staggering number of characters who are referred to by both their names and their informal familiar titles. I gave up trying to keep track of all the characters and decided to power through the book focusing on the main plot and the central characters. For the more patient reader, the book is nicely footnoted, explaining the meaning of the names and the familiar titles, so it is possible to follow the details if you have the patience."
585,0,"Abridged from a multi-volume mid-18-Century novel, this lively retelling captures the essence and the details of life and love in a rich Chinese household. Multiple intrigues and myriad characters mix, some characters disappear, some plots remain unresolved. But there is no complete version, so this greatly shortened rendition is quite satisfactory."
586,0,This is the greatest novel ever published in the Chinese language. A true classic. Perhaps at the same level as Shakespeare. This novel is so highly regarded that entire schools of thought and research have arisen around it.
587,0,In China this is considered a literary classic. I read it because I do business with China and I was told it might make understand their culture better. It really didn't it might of lost something in translation but a good story.
588,0,"Dream of the Red Chamber, written in the 18th century in China, is a book for people who have a particular interest in Chinese culture.  For those of thus who do, we are grateful to have it available.  But for a person just looking for a diverting read, not so much."
589,0,"An interesting read, makes me wish I understood a bit more of the Chinese writing tradition. Would recommend to someone who is interested in great world literature."
590,0,"Chinese version, sorta, of Peyton Place.  An amusing and educational (chinese culture) read.  Discovered this book on a list of texts required for a Chinese literature class."
591,0,"If you don't read another Chinese novel, this one will complete your experience.  It is the quintissential story of family life in China."
592,0,"I needed this book for my east asian civilization class and I was already dreading reading a required book. This book is actually really well written. It deals with chinese legends and myths mix in with fiction. The names in the story can be confusing (you will mix them up) for a Western reader like myself but the book reminds you every so often who everyone is. Please pick up this book, you won't be disappointed."
593,0,a great descriptive story
594,0,Excellent book!  An encouraging read!
595,0,I love all of Oswald Chambers books and this was no exception.
596,0,"Any Horror aficionado who does not purchase and read ALL of Brandon Massey's edited anthologies is missing a major, MAJOR source of excellent storytelling, frightening tales, and I'm telling you, fresh horror perspectives and we all know how hard THOSE are to find! I am a Lovecraft fan, a M.R. James fan, and NOW I can PROUDLY boast that I am a Brandon Massey fan, a Tananarive Due fan, an L.R. Giles devotee to name just a FEW of the excellent horror story weavers in these anthologies. I am STILL mildly traumatized by a story in the last anthology, ""Danger Word"" by the great Tananarive Due and Uber talented Steven Barnes, I kid you not. I am a happy collector of any of Brandon's work and that collecting shall continue."
597,0,"This is the third installment of the Dark Dreams anthology series and so far, the best of the lot. Though previous entries were very good, none of them consistently delivered like this one. Oddly enough, the current book is the one with the least amount of promotion. So I thought I'd add my two cents."
598,0,I recommend Whispers In The Night on the basis of the following stories:
599,0,SCAB by Wrath James White. This story was my first introduction to White and what an introduction! Very powerful short story about where insecurity and negative self image can lead. A young man is so totally convinced he is ugly and unlovable until he perceives genuine romantic interest as ridicule and responds in the most barbaric of ways. One of the best stories in the installment.
600,0,"AND DEATH RODE WITH HIM by Anthony Beal. This story deals with hell and the inability to escape it. Not as good as Scab, but a nice story nonetheless."
601,0,"ARE YOU MY DADDY by Lexi Davis. This was another one of my favorites in the anthology. Once again, I never heard of Lexi Davis before this. But on the basis of her work here, I'll make an effort to purchase her future works. Davis somehow manages to combine humor and horror and turn it into a rollicking good time! This story had me literally laughing out loud! Its hysterical! So good, in fact, I was depressed when it was over. This was the first short story I read where I was disappointed it was a short story...I wanted it to go on for several more pages. If you need one reason to buy this book, this story is it!"
602,0,TO GET BREAD AND BUTTER by Randy Walker. Good story -- about equal to AND DEATH RODE WITH HIM.
603,0,"DREAM GIRL by Dameon Edwards -- slightly better than TO GET BREAD AND BUTTER. Actually, this would've been a much better tale if it had some sort of closure to it."
604,0,MY SISTER'S KEEPER by Chesya Burke. This was a powerful story. A sister is lost to crack addiction and her family must write her off for their own well-being. It's heartrending...remarkably potent for a short story. This is a perfect example of how to write about a depressing topic without needlessly alienating the reader. Its another favorite.
605,0,"THE WASP by Robert Fleming. With all due respect to the author, I didn't care for this tale too much. Fleming's literary skills are exceptional. But the story itself bordered on sadism. A little too twisted for me. Besides being a man, the resolution left me feeling uncomfortable..."
606,0,HELL IS FOR CHILDREN by Rickey Windell George. Same as above. Too depressing. Aren't black people down enough already???? Read Chesya Burke.
607,0,FLIGHT by Lawana James-Holland. Great tale. It seems a little out of place in a horror anthology though. It reads more like heroic fiction. This is the antidote to anyone put off by REH's prejudicial Solomon Kane stories. Love to see James-Holland turn this into a recurring character...
608,0,"MR. BONES by Christopher Chambers. Loved this story. It reminded me of the indignities minstrel performers like Bert Williams had to endure. It really touched a nerve. If this story doesn't inspire you to conduct yourself with class and dignity, there's no hope for you. Should be required reading...another favorite."
609,0,POWER AND PURPOSE by L.R. Giles. This story is too good to be ignored. Karyn has a premonition of a popular minister's assassination. She does everything in her power to keep it from coming to pass. Karyn should be a recurring character. Giles only gets better with time. I liked his story in the previous anthology and this one is far better than that one!
610,0,"GHOSTWRITER by Brandon Massey is a nice sentimental story...that adds closure to this volume. Not his best work, but it'll do..."
611,0,"So the stories I highly recommend reading are Scab, Are you my Daddy? My Sister's Keeper, Flight, Mr. Bones and Power and Purpose! The other stories are fine. But these more than compensate for the price of the book."
612,0,Some of the stories were poorly written on the plot was very basic. It was just ok.
613,0,I've read many horror stories and I must say these stories really and truly got to me! Especially being that I could relate more closely to the stories from an african american point of view! I don't know which was my favorite and I wouldn't even try to say which was my favorite they were all that good and CREEPY!
614,0,A must read for the horror genre readers! Enjoy!
615,0,"This is the 3rd in the Dark Dreams Series!  You won't be let down with this new group of short stories!  Tananarive Due's ""Summer"" will have you checking those summertime bugs that always seem to be hanging around! ""Are You My Daddy"" gives new meaning to Baby Mama Drama!  If you've enjoyed Dark Dreams I and II you won't be disappointed!"
616,0,I bought this book after a few years b/c I couldn't hold out any longer I wanted to see what the next installment offered. Man did I waste my money. The stories were not as engaging and I felt as if the tone of this book was a lot different from previous entries. I tried but couldn't engage myself with any of the stories.
617,0,"Purchased as a gift for a young adult, HE LOVED IT!  He has been reading these books for ears and loves Brandon Massey"
618,0,"As with the two previous outings, this anthology is a guilty pleasure and privilege. Though, I'm always saddened that we still have to segregate in the 21st century to gain mainstream recognition.  I'm an avid fan of Ms. Due and Mr. Massey and have collected almost they have written."
619,0,This book i cld not put down. lost a lot of sleep lol. This is a book that keep u on the edge. Recommended it to my daughter who feel the same way
620,0,received the product really fast and very impressed.  would order again from the seller
621,0,While it might be premature to give full comment on this book because I am yet to read it all up. I must say it is a very good reference book for any Development Studies student or practitioner who is looking to make a sustained difference with development initiatives.  This book was recommended by my Professor and Thesis Supervisor. Its an insightful read on participatory approach to development.
622,0,Good book.
623,0,"In these brilliantly written novellas, Eileen Chang brushes a harsh portrait of the Chinese society between the two world wars. It was based on clan power, wealth, family traditions, status, arranged marriages (matches), reputations, age (wrinkles), battles between old and young and between traditional and Western life style, and last but not least, on opium."
624,0,"In `Love in a fallen City', all traditional values are crumbling down: `here in this uncertain world, money, property, the permanent things - they're all unreliable. The only thing she could rely on was the breath in her lungs and the person who lay sleeping beside her. He was just a selfish man; she was a selfish woman. In this age of chaos and disorder, there is no place for those who stand on their own, but for an ordinary married couple, room can always be found.'"
625,0,"`The Golden Cangue' is a fierce, merciless portrait of a member of a traditional Chinese polygamous family, who represents `the ancient China he had been homesick for ... His quiet and demure well-born Chinese girl was an opium smoker.'"
626,0,"`Aloeswood incense' tells the story of the sentimental education of a young girl, a king of Chinese `Gigi': `You shouldn't think that just because a person is reasonably good-looking, knows how to make a chitchat and sing a few English songs, that people are going to come running to give her stacks and stacks of money. You are too bashful, too weak, and too bad-tempered; you're indecisive, and you get too emotionally involved.'"
627,0,"Reputation isn't what it was before: `For a woman, there is nothing more important than her reputation. When I use the word `reputation', I mean something a bit different from a fusty old scholar's idea. These days, people don't care that much about chastity.'"
628,0,"In `Jasmine Tea' a student who is hated by his father, seeks revenge against the daughter of the former `friend' of his mother, who could have been his father."
629,0,"In `Sealed Off', a married man and a young girl meet one another in a streetcar during a city blockade. But, even the slightest real contact seems impossible: `all she wanted was one small part of him, a little part that no one else wanted.'"
630,0,"In `Red Rose, White Rose', `maybe everyman has had two such women. Marry a red rose and eventually she'll be a mosquito-blood streak smeared on the wall, while the white rose is `moonlight in front of my bed'.'"
631,0,"Here, a man remembers the women in his life: a Paris whore, prostitutes, an English `not so puritan' young lady, the wife of a friend and a dull wife."
632,0,"These novellas shine through the extreme intensity of the (strained) emotions, the merciless portraits of and the infighting in Chinese families between its hypocrite members and the difficulties to get engaged in a really sincere relationship."
633,0,Not to be missed.
634,0,Interest in Eileen Chang's works was revived in the English speaking world by Ang Lee's film adaptation of the lead title in this collection of five short stories.
635,0,"""Lust, Caution"""

643,0,"""Traces of Love"""
644,0,A cynical but irreproachably proper woman marries a much older man for the money he has. Yet she never asks him about his will or to make provisions for her and she feels anxious whenever he visits his first wife. Is it really about money?
645,0,The heroines (all the stories turn around women) all miss something crucial about themselves.
646,0,"Mrs. Mai falls in love with the wrong man, the bride is spending as much money as she can on her trousseau because she assumes her wedding day will be the only happy one in her life, Ah Xiao devotes herself to a dismissive employer, while Dunfeng believes herself more cynical than she really is."
647,0,These women reach for happiness by pursuing romantic passion or luxuries or motherly care or wealth. Tragically they miss the good in themselves by following the path others expect of them.
648,0,"Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"
649,0,really good read!
650,0,"This book has it all! I am a masters student at Columbia University studying Neuroscience and Education. My thesis is on the neuroscience of mindfulness and I have read over 20 books touting mindfulness research in an educational setting - So many of them are for beginners seem to be written for an ideal classroom that does not exist (did I mention that I'm an 8th grade Special Education teacher in Brooklyn?) This book is full of the newest research and applications for the classroom. It hits on interdisciplinary levels, such as social emotional learning, and the fixed/growth mindset. This book would be great to give anyone you know who has developed learned helplessness or chronic stress over time - regardless of whether they are an educator or student. Aside from this book, I also recommend Daniel Rechtschaffen's book, The Way of Mindful Education, which has great lesson plans for students of all ages (and all demographics) in the classroom."
651,0,"Mindfulness is the capacity to achieve nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment, without grasping or aversion. (Boddhi, 1999).  Research has revealed that there are specific identifiable components of mindfulness meditation: attention regulation; body awareness; emotion regulation; and change in perspective on the self.  (Holzel, et al., 2011, p. 539)"
652,0,"There is currently a great renewal of interest in promoting Social Emotional Learning (“SEL”) in our schools, together with recognition that mindfulness based approaches could form an important component of approaches geared towards development of social-emotional skills.  Research shows that we have a greater need than ever for schools to address the nonacademic needs of students, as statistically significant minorities of school aged children have statistically significant emotional/behavioral vulnerabilities and lack of academic readiness.  (Jennings P., Lantieri, L, & Roeser, R., 2012, p. 372).  There are two main avenues through which this can be accomplished:  (1) creating a curriculum that promotes mindfulness (and SEL) through inquiry-based, collaborative, experiential learning (as already done in certain private schools, e.g., Montessori and Reggio Emilia); and (2) instructing teachers and students in the regular use of mindfulness based practices, preferably as part of an organization-wide or state-wide SEL program."
653,0,"Against this backdrop, a number of books have been published in recent years, exploring ways in which mindfulness can be used to support the work of education in the social-emotional arena.  One such book is Mindful Learning, written by two professors at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, Drs. Craig Hassed and Richard Chambers.  This book would be an excellent first read for educators who would like to learn about the science behind, and benefits of, mindfulness practices.  The book is scaffolded in a way that allows for clear understanding of the potential positive relationship between mindfulness and the mental qualities necessary for efficient learning.  The reach of the book is broad, ranging from the science supporting the use of mindfulness based interventions, to the mental skill sets needed for effective learning, to actual practices that educators may use to develop a mindfulness practice."
654,0,"Unsurprisingly, given the secular focus of the book, the authors focus on four cognitive aspects of mindfulness: Perception; Nonattachment (letting go); Acceptance; and Present moment (awareness). (Id., pp. 12-17):"
655,0,"• Perception:  lack of perception involves believing the stories our brains tell us, having a narrow viewpoint or a fixed mindset;  with mindfulness we may begin perceiving what we project onto situations, for example, bringing us to a different perspective, seeing the bigger picture or seeing things from a different angle."
656,0,"• Nonattachment: involves letting go of or releasing thoughts, feelings, ideas; neither grasping onto or pushing away from (aversion)."
657,0,"• Acceptance:  after noticing or acknowledging what is (perception) and being neutral towards it (non-attachment), can we accept or allow things to be as they are? The authors offer a caveat: “(u)sing acceptance to make something go away is actually nonacceptance masquerading as acceptance…”  What is helpful here is remembering the impermanence of all things, that this too shall pass. Also, we should refrain from “shooting the second arrow”, that is, letting go of any judgment of the thought, idea, feeling, or sensation as “bad” or “wrong”.  Although this may sound, it is not easy – because sometimes what arises is difficult or painful or even intolerable.  (Id., p. 16)."
658,0,"• Present Moment: “The present moment is the only moment that has any legitimate claim to reality.  The past and future are just ideas.  The past and future never actually exist…” (Id., p. 17)."
659,0,"At the beginning of Mindful Learning, the authors discuss the need for a pedagogical shift to an inquiry based approach to education, i.e., the dialectic approach, as opposed to the traditional public school approach where the teachers are providing knowledge and the student absorbs it (without much reflection or personal connection).  There is recognition of the importance that students maintain a childlike fascination with the subject matter.  The question is posed, how do we keep children interested, and not destroy their naturally inquisitive spirit, ending up like a “snuffed out candle”? (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 3, quoting Einstein)."
660,0," “Einstein felt that real discovery was an intuitive process.  Intuition…comes from the Latin word intueri, meaning “to look upon, consider, contemplate.”  It is not “an unconscious, unreflecting, conditioned, or automatic way of seeing things.  It is all about being conscious and aware.  If we really look we have a chance of understanding, because what is within us is connecting with what we are observing.  Thus connectedness, or unity, goes hand in hand with learning mindfully.”  (Ibid.)."
661,0,"After this beginning, there is very little in the book that discusses changing the pedagogy of schools; rather the primary focus is on educating teachers so that they may be mindful models of educational leadership in the classroom.  Developing mindfulness in teachers is viewed as an issue of primary importance  by the authors: “Education (on mindfulness) needs to take place at a number of levels, starting with the training of quality mindfulness teachers.” (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 179).  Thus, Mindful Learning focuses to a large extent on bringing mindfulness into the classroom through teachers who have developed their own mindfulness practices, as well as through scripted mindfulness exercises to be practiced with students, which may be found in Chapter 20."
662,0,"Much of the book is devoted to presenting evidence of why engaging in mindfulness is a beneficial practice for teachers and students.  However,  they do recognize the indispensable truth that “(m)indfulness can only be offered; the choice is always the person’s own as to whether they will take up the gift.” (Id., p. 145).  “Mindfulness cannot be imposed on students.  They will need a level of motivation and insight in order to engage with the process.  Otherwise they will just pretend to go through the motions to keep the teacher happy, or – even worse – they will build up resistance and resentment to mindfulness, an attitude that might be difficult to shift.” (p. 144)."
663,0,"The authors call for a type of “applied mindfulness” which departs from traditional mindfulness practice by its results driven focus of attaining specific goals, such as stress reduction and performance enhancement.  In contrast, mindfulness as developed from ancient Buddhist philosophy has at its core the purpose of achieving enduring happiness and gaining insight into the true nature of existence (impermanent, unreliable, and non-self). (Boddhi, 1999).  The authors state that, instead of teaching mindfulness and “letting students figure out on their own how to apply it,” they teach mindfulness with the stated goals of managing stress, improving study performance (by learning to sustain attention and focus over a period of time), developing presence of mind rather than trying to multitask , and overcoming procrastination. (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 48)."
664,0,"The definition of mindfulness in Mindful Learning is a “mental discipline aimed at training attention” (Id., p. 6).  In this reader’s opinion, this definition omits the true purpose of mindfulness as a path for transformation, that involves development of wisdom, intuition and discernment, liberation from suffering, and inner growth of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (the brahmaviharas). The concern here is that mindfulness could end up becoming a tool to enable students to be calm and compliant with a dull curriculum, rather than following a path paved with curiosity and kindness, with an aim of inner transformation."
665,0,"Drs. Hassed and Chambers believe that applied mindfulness is justified by the results:  that hooking students and teachers into trying mindfulness (as a secular practice that enhances performance and reduces stress) will allow them to experience mindfulness.  The viewpoint is that once people begin practicing mindfulness, they will understand on an experiential level the benefits of such a practice, and then begin to apply it more broadly in their lives, that is, generalize mindfulness to other areas of their lives.  The concept of “applied mindfulness” will likely appeal to many within the public education system, with its focus on measurable results in attainment of educational skills.  However, this view of mindfulness arguably omits the heart of mindfulness:  which is to wake up to whatever is, in the present moment, and to allow what is there to just be, with loving-kindness and gentle curiosity.  A question that arises is, if the practice of “applied mindfulness” is results-driven and goal-oriented, is it still mindfulness?"
666,0,"However, it is understood that our public education system is mandated, to the extent possible, to use secular methodologies shown to be effective by scientific research which will enable students to make measurable progress in skill acquisition.  Perhaps what we need are some additional goals in education, which incorporate skills which are not so measurable, such as kindness, empathy, and joy in learning?  Our society is so results driven, can we allow space for these priceless capacities to arise?"
667,0,"Putting aside the issue of “applied mindfulness,” there are many positive aspects to this book.  For instance, the discussion of mindfulness and attention in the early part of the book is spot on.  The authors discuss how we are often not even aware of where our attention is, and that noticing what our attention is focused upon is the first step in developing mindfulness.  “Mindfulness is not a distraction from our worries.”  (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 9).  “Mindfulness meditation is…not a method of tuning out but rather of tuning in…..” (Id., p. 11).  “We cannot stop the mind from thinking” . . . . . but we can “learn to be less reactive to it or involved in it.” (Id., p. 10)."
668,0,"One of the main thrusts of this book is the positive impact of mindfulness upon executive functioning skills, which are high level functions of the brain’s prefrontal cortex important for learning.  “Research shows that practicing mindfulness activates many of the same brain areas as those that are active when we are engaged in executive functioning…….particularly attention, short-term memory, regulating emotional impulses, planning, and mental flexibility.”  (Id., p. 24).  Strengthening these capacities is one of the primary purposes for the use of “applied mindfulness” according to the authors."
669,0,"One of the ways in which the authors explain the benefits of mindfulness is by exploring the “costs” of mindlessness, including the following:"
670,0,• Wasting Time
671,0,• Not Understanding Things
672,0,• Mental Roadblocks
673,0,• Poor Emotional Well-Being
674,0,• Not Enjoying Life
675,0,• Can’t Sleep
676,0,• Communicating Poorly
677,0,• More Distractible
678,0,• Lack of Motivation
679,0,• Poor Memory
680,0,"• Effects on the Brain (Id., pp. 40-45)."
681,0,"We are reminded of an important lesson from neuroscience: that whatever we practice becomes the habit of the mind.  “(W)e give power to whatever our attention is directed to.”  (Id., p. 11).  As  Dr. Dan Siegel often says, “neurons that fire together, wire together”.  Thus, the more we practice “unmindfulness”, the more we will reap the “costs” listed above.  Research has shown that mindfulness can “ literally shape our brain in ways that make it much easier to concentrate, remember and learn, regulate emotions and behaviors, reason and think abstractly.” (Id., p. 32)."
682,0,"In furtherance of cultivating mindfulness within the teaching environment, the authors suggest creating a mindful physical environment, regular practices of self-care, and a teaching style that is calm and enthusiastic, encouraging openness, and which uses mindfulness practices in the classroom.  The authors do recognize the importance of teaching mindfulness not as “a separate skill divorced from other aspects of the curriculum” but rather as something that is “integrated with other content.” (Id., p. 141).  There appears to be an assumption that teachers will intuitively know how to do such things as a result of their own mindfulness practices, as the authors do not deeply delve into how these things might be accomplished as a practical matter."
683,0,"However, this may be because one of the key points made by the authors is the importance of learning from failure.  They state that “(a) mindful response to failure is:"
684,0,"• To be able to sit with, and be open to, the discomfort."

699,0," The authors believe that if mindfulness practices are adopted first by adults, this will result in mindful teaching methods, as a result of changing expectations into aspirations, changing mindsets, learning to learn from failure, and working with emotions mindfully.  Thankfully, the authors do fully recognize that such change does not happen overnight. (Id., p. 167)."
700,0,Conclusion:
701,0,"Mindful Learning covers a large range of territory, and has sufficient depth for an educator’s first introduction to Mindfulness.  The book is carefully written to avoid any religious, philosophical, or spiritual overtones, which might cause discomfort in the educational setting. The focus on the brain-based (or cognitive) aspects of mindfulness (e.g., improving executive functioning skills such as attention and working memory) give the book a solid grounding in educational science.  The practices included in the back of the book are well scripted, and useful.  While the book does not discuss needed changes in state-wide or school district-wide pedagogy to bring mindfulness into the mainstream of education, it does address some of the challenges associated with organizational change."
702,0,"One concern that arose is the potential effect of divorcing of mindfulness from grounding in ethics (such as the Noble Eightfold Path), loving-kindness, ethical/moral values, or spiritual principles.  This book contains William James’ oft-quoted statement on “the importance of being able to focus attention as the ultimate education.” (Id., p. 5).  However, mindfulness is not just about the focusing of attention, but also about the attitude that we cultivate towards what we pay attention to, and how we act in response to what arises."
703,0," While this book has omitted what many consider to be the true purposes of mindfulness: a path for transformation, liberation from suffering, wisdom, development of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity (the brahmaviharas), that may well have been intentional, in order to make delivery of the message of mindfulness more palatable to those within the educational system."
704,0," It is encouraging that books such as Mindful Learning have arrived on the educational scene, which are helping to breathe new life into the movement to bring mindfulness-based approaches, which are consistent with social-emotional learning principles, into the realm of public education."

747,0,"It had been only a few days since the end of the school year.  I stared down at the book titled Mindful Learning, written by Dr. Craig Hassed and Dr. Richard Chambers, mindfulness consultants at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  The cover, which looks like a chalkboard, triggered a flood of memories from the classroom.  Was I ready to read my first full-fledged mindfulness in education book for the summer?"
748,0,"After a week or two of mindful waiting, I started reading, not knowing exactly what to expect.  I had chosen to read this book because it has been marketed toward people who work with high-school age children and above.  Other related books - “The Way of Mindful Education”, “Teach, Breathe, Learn”, and “Mindfulness for Teachers” – I read while teaching middle school.  Now that I had moved onto teaching older students, it seemed appropriate to explore a resource targeting this age group."
749,0,"True to the Aussie way of being, Hassed and Chambers adopt a casual tone, even when delving into complex topics such as neuroscience.  Throughout the book, they use the pronouns “we” and “us”, referring to the wider community as well as to themselves.  They also use brevity to their benefit, using the least possible words that still relay their thoughts. But blink and you might miss a transition, giving a feeling of abrupt turns.  Look closely and you’ll see how carefully they organized their book.  They begin by defining education and mindfulness before moving on to exploring mindfulness in student learning, which is the text’s main focus.  They then discuss mindfulness in creativity, sports, and relationships.  Later, the authors apply mindfulness to teachers, even laying out ways to work with those resistant to incorporating these practices into the classroom.  They follow by describing how mindfulness goes well beyond school walls.  For concluding thoughts, they briefly mention potential approaches that organizations can implement when incorporating mindfulness, along with common snafus they may face.  For takeaway tools, they include twelve sample exercises for teachers to try in or out of the classroom."
750,0,"Instead of beginning with a definition of mindfulness, Hassed and Chambers first invite us to pause by asking the question, “What is education?”  It has taken me years to fully arrive at their view of education as a holistic endeavor where teachers and students can learn from any situation – an endeavor where teachers facilitate or elicit existing insight through inquiry and questioning.  Mindfulness supports this perspective.  I read about this holistic approach while in graduate school for teaching and learning, but I didn’t understand or embody it until I went so fully away from this view and back again after almost leaving the profession entirely.  Why is it that so many teachers lose sight of teaching as drawing out from within?  I still grapple with this question, trying to balance my own views with the existing structures in the public school district where I teach.  From this searching perspective, I fully appreciated the authors’ note - “The journey to becoming a mindful teacher and learner is a lifelong project” (2014, p.4)."
751,0,"In our fast-paced world, mindfulness can appear counter-intuitive.  Instead of pausing to navel gaze, shouldn’t we be doing more to get ahead?  Hassed and Chambers efficiently and thoroughly address the misconception that mindfulness meditation is about stopping and clearing one’s thoughts.  They explain how it is more of a process of awareness and release from the grips of thinking, giving away our attachments to our thoughts.  They don’t contribute anything new to the existing foundational knowledge of mindfulness.  Rather, they organize information into a secular, digest-able fashion, using vignettes from the school setting.  Then, to boost our confidence and conviction about the importance of mindfulness in a world of skepticism, they ground us in the dominant language of science.  Explaining clearly how mindfulness practices can shape our brains to improve concentration, memorization, emotional regulation, reasoning, and abstract thinking, they convince even a skeptic to explore the potential of mindfulness to enhance (and even transform) our educational, recreational, and personal lives."
752,0,"Hassed and Chambers’ find a niche in their attention to the effects of mindfulness on stress, focus, and performance in older students.  Like many others, I used to think that we need a certain bit of stress in order to perform better.  However, the authors illustrate how we can perform from a mindful state of calm and confidence, free from stress.  It’s worth looking up the Hassed mindfulness-based stress-performance graph to rethink your view on stress.  They convinced me that mindfulness is a valuable skill, mindset, and way of being that helps us reduce stress and enhance attention.  If you aren’t convinced by their graph, read their chapter on why attention matters – the costs of unmindfulness.  Wasting time, not understanding things, poor emotional well-being, and not enjoying life are just some of the outcomes of living in the dark."
753,0,"What struck me about Hassed and Chambers is how intentional they are with their use of mindfulness in education.  Instead of leaving the effects of mindfulness on student learning up to chance, they have specifically created a program, Mindfulness for Academic Success (MAS), to apply mindfulness to studying.  This program came out of their personal realizations that people more easily comprehend mindfulness when the focus is more explicit.  They share a few exercises to give us a taste of MAS.  I tried out their study meditation where students work on a written task while noting any mental distractions on one side of the paper.  Experientially, I understood their intention of helping students fully acknowledge and accept distractions in order to fully let go of them.  This was my first encounter with a program focused so directly on academic behavior – I wish I had enrolled in this program as an overwhelmed undergraduate."
754,0,"Their chapters on resilience, emotional development, and communication sometimes read like a self-help book, providing tips and explanations on how to practice mindfulness to promote these skills.  Although this tone can be perceived as superficial, it can also be construed as actually helpful in providing us with a broader view of what mindfulness can do for our students.  Hassed and Chambers even take the time to address creativity, movement, and relationships since school is not always just about academics; arts, athletics, and social events play a large part in many communities.  In addition, I found their chapter on eMindfulness – how paying attention helps us use media more wisely – timely and highly applicable for our ultra-connected young adults."
755,0,"I particularly enjoyed their roadmap for building mindfulness practices in children throughout the years, so that they do not fall into “mindfulness fatigue”.  Hassed and Chambers begin with Elementary School – Years 1-3: “simple mindfulness exercises to provide some quiet at the start and end of class” and end with College or University: “Teach how mindfulness applies to leadership, professional development, higher executive functioning, and self-care” (2014, p.142-143).  It is powerful to envision what mindfulness can look like if woven into long-term educational planning.  Of course, this roadmap is only an example of what can happen, as educators very well know the intricate complexities of planning and implementing curricula in large educational systems."
756,0,"Lest you think Hassed and Chambers focus only on students, fear not.  They thoughtfully round out their mindfulness tour with a focus on the teacher.  As someone who has experienced almost all of the major barriers to teaching – burnout, stress, poor mental health, to name a few – it was cathartic to have someone put these difficulties into words and how mindfulness can help us to work through or around these so-called barriers."
757,0,"Just when you get the sense that something might be missing from their whole tour, Hassed and Chambers admit that the attention training aspect of mindfulness can seem a little cold by itself.  They broaden mindfulness beyond the classroom by noting how mindfulness can be equally thought of as heartfulness.  They write, “The word mindfulness implies ‘mind’ – which many people equate to the brain – and so risks obscuring what is most important about learning to be more awake, open, and loving in each moment of life” (2014, p. 162).  As I arrived at the end of the book, I sensed some warm and fuzzies, fully opening to the potential of mindfulness to transform our way of being in the world."
758,0,"Overall, I am filled with gratitude toward Hassed and Chambers for providing teachers, administrators, and parents with some clarity in our lifelong journeys to becoming mindful people and role models for our children.  I envision Mindful Learning as a useful resource for a school district or university interested in implementing mindfulness.  The text probably will appeal more-so to teachers of older students who are expected to study independently and become more aware of their learning habits, but the principles apply to every age level.  For a school district, it would be a great way for teachers to become more well-versed in what mindfulness actually is and how it can help.  The chapters can be used as stand-alone resources over a longer period of time, leaving plenty of room for discussion and dialogue.  After all, it is up to individuals and small groups to decide what to do with this valuable information."
759,0,"Keep in mind as you continue your exploration of mindfulness in education that there is a multitude of resources to drawn from.  To learn more about the unmindfulness, or mindlessness, check out Ellen Langer’s ""Mindfulness"" (1990).  Interested in the neurobiology of mindfulness?  Read Willoughby Britton and Arielle Sydnor’s “Neurobiological models of meditation practices: Implications for application with youth” (2015) in Chris Willard and Amy Saltzman’s “Teaching Mindfulness Skills to Kids and Teens”.  Amishi Jha also delves into the science behind mindfulness in her talk, “Improving Attention and Working Memory” (2012), which can be found on Vimeo.  Searching for more guided mindfulness meditation practice?  Try the Headspace app, which leads you through a 30-day foundational practice before opening up to different themes such as health, relationships, or performance.  The first ten days are free, so don’t hesitate!  May your journey be filled with insights, connections, and personal growth."
760,0,"There is so much fascinating information in here about how the brain works, plus how we can best help our students learn.  I highly recommend it!"
761,0,"Clear, concise, well-supported. Very helpful to anyone hoping to gain an overview of well-documented aspects of mindfulness and the brain!"
762,0,"Dry book. Interesting material, but it's a chore to read. This may be because I had to read it for a class. Take it with a grain of salt."
763,0,Excellent book on Mindfulness .. well written with lots of good ideas //recommended
764,0,Excellent
765,0,"This book provides the reader with an A - Z understanding of mindful learning.  What became clear to me in reading this book is that mindful learning is not just for the classroom, but for the curriculum of life. If you value learning this book if for you.  Well written, well researched and practical."
766,0,"This book is made for me. I lived many years as absent mind person, now this book is helping to overcome that and I am enjoying my life."
767,0,"I'm a big fan of both authors, so I was hugely disappointed with this book. It was both the characters & the ending that I did not like. Instead of finding Jordana to be an exciting, independent woman for the time period, I thought she was manipulative and self-serving in her actions, never considering the repercussions of her actions on other people. She had a singlemindedness about her that was not admirable because of the way she went about getting what she wanted, while confessing God's leading & protection. Her bullying of her older brother came off as disrespectful & mean, which was disturbing. The story of her older sister in CA drug on endlessly with both husband & wife repeating the same litany of complaints, without trusting God or each other with their burdens. I got tired of reading about them. I did enjoy & respect Jordana's brother & their new friend, Caitlyn. Adding to my dissatisfaction with the book, was getting to the end, only to find NO resolution to any of the main characters stories!"
768,0,"Rarely do I remove a book from my device, but this one is now gone."
769,0,"The biggest surprise in this book was that it didn't end!  Oh, there were no more pages to read . . . but none of the plot lines were resolved.  It ""ended"" in the middle.  I don't like being taken advantage of in this way and for this reason alone, I won't read any more in the series.  Normally, I love a series because I fall in love with the characters as I did with this book.  But I expect each book to also stand on its own.  This one doesn't."
770,0,So it's done  . . . and I'm done.
771,0,"I have read and enjoyed books by both authors, so I had high hopes for this novel.  I found this volume disappointing on many fronts.  The action took place across the US, with subjects ranging from the Civil War, the Transcontinental Railroad, Westward expansion,  and the photographic processes of the time period.  I thought the pacing was uneven, and sluggish for the most part.  The characters were fairly engaging,  but I felt that none of them were really well developed.  All seemed to have major trouble with communicating their needs and feelings.  There were multiple plot lines and NONE were fully resolved at the conclusion of this novel.  Even so, the ending felt contrived and I had a hard time believing that parents in that time period would be supportive of the choices their children made at the conclusion.  (This comment is vague intentionally so as not to be a spoiler)"
772,0,"I felt that the authors would have served their characters (and readers )better had they chosen to focus on one set of characters at a time, and had at least one plot line reach a satisfying conclusion in each novel.  The choices they have made impel the reader to buy multiple volumes in order to have any resolution.  This strategy failed in my case, as I just don't care what happens next to any of these characters."

777,0,"Religion : prayer and trust in God mentioned often, but no strong statements of faith in Christ  or Salvation message."
778,0,There were two major stories in this book...
779,0,"1) Caitlan, an 18 year old Irish girl is sent away from home and a potentially nasty situation to America where her much older brother is living. A letter to Brenton and Jordana Baldwin (brother and sister, who's parents are in Russia for an extended work related stay) lets them know she will be arriving by ship soon to NYC, where they live. This was such a surprise, but they soon become fast friends, even though the difference in their social status is huge. It makes no difference to the wealthy brother and sister, but Caitlan, of the very poor working class feels the difference and will not take their offerings of lodging, so sets out to work as a chamber maid at another home. Eventually they all set off for a trek across America to find her brother in California. Now, mind you, it's during the Civil war and the three of them are 19, 16, and 18. Yikes. So that's the first story, the three young folk making their way through cities on trains with Brenton's photography gear, until there are no more rails, where at that point a wagon and horses are purchased to make their way across the plains and mountains, um, alone. Again, yikes."
780,0,"The second story is of Caitlan's brother, Kiernan and his wife Victoria, who is Brenton and Jordana's older sister. Kiernan, a handsome charming, hard working Irish lad, lost Victoria's fortune after they married when they went to California to mine gold. They move from place to place, barely scraping by, eating meagerly, but are very much in love. Little do they know (it is the 1860’s, and it's not like they can just view an email) his sister is escaping a bad situation and headed their way. They have no idea where she is, nor how to reach her, nor when she might get there, nor where she thinks she might meet them, since she doesn't even know where they are. Yep... yikes!"
781,0,Lots of exciting stories and events happen in both stories.
782,0,"I think this may be my favorite Judith Pella/Tracie Peterson book so far. I'd almost given up on their books because I was becoming less and less a fan. But the writing is good, and it truly keeps your interest. Although all the talk about railroads was boring to me, it was easy to skip a few paragraphs at a time to pick back up on the story a bit later."
783,0,"The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that this is not a full book. I may not have picked it up if I had known that, because now I don't know what happens to the three young people who have been traveling for over a year and are only about half way across the country. But it was a good book and well written, and you will want to find out what happens to the groups, which is the point isn't it?"
784,0,"After reading a couple of completely amateur freebie Westerns, tucking into this one proved to be pure delight. It brilliantly brings to life the early days of the Civil War from the viewpoint of young New Yorkers. A highlight was the young man's struggle with complex issues of enlisting. The plot treats the reader to a look inside the home of the Vanderbilts and high New York Society and the challenges and thrills of traveling West in wartime. A less engaging subplot follows the struggles of a California miner who  fritters away his wife's fortune and the repetitive narrative of their marital woes. This was but loosely engaged to the main plot and might better have been saved for a different volume."
785,0,"At times the writing sank toward the pedantic. Many pages are wasted with characters struggling over the same issues in their heads rather than living them in breathtaking action or clever dialog. A great editor should be all over that. Finally, the writers just seemed to pick a spot to stop writing with a small tease for the next volume of the series. If you enjoy a great ride to a breathtaking climax and a settling denouement, you'll not find it here."
786,0,"Judith Pella and Tracie Peterson have done a wonderful job collaborating on this Christian western romance.  We are introduced to the Baldwin family and their adventures in the building of the West in connection with the transpacific railroad.  In this book we learn to love each of the members of the Baldwin family as well as their extended family.  The female protagonist that stands out for me is Jordana.  We see her emerge from an adolescent into a woman.  The authors did a superb job in her character development.  I like the way they used the literary tool of foreshadowing to building the plot line rising action.  For example, when discussing Victoria’s life (the eldest of the Baldwin siblings) in California there is references to the Donner Pass.  Needless to say, if you are a history buff you are aware of the significance of the Donner Pass and the Donner Party.  Tapping into this knowledge makes the reader curious if Victoria’s husband gets caught in this situation.  This is an excellent example of the authors’ writing skills in keeping and maintaining the reader’s interest.  In addition, the author’s end the story at the correct point as now the reader wants to read more about each of these strong and determined characters.  You can’t help but root for their success but you are left with a big question as to what happens next.  Well done."
787,0,"An interesting read of the civil war and the conception of the railroads.  The story covers a couple in California who hunts the gold dream and ends up working for the railroad.  In love but unable to have children cause their marriage to strain, but they manage to hold on, barely."
788,0,"There's also a brother sister duo in New York.  Benton is a photographer who is hired to take pictures of the country, cities near where the railroads will be.  Jordana is finishing school, and has a lot of spunk and actually, she is what keeps the story going.  Then there is Caitlin,  who arrives from Ireland and is supposed to go to the couple in California."
789,0,"Great story line, just nothing is resolved in the end. Not really a cliffhanger, just a bland dead end.  Yet still worth reading if you are into the American civil war era and the railroads."
790,0,"Volume of a trilogy written about the railroad system being built from east to west. It is centered around an expansive family full if colorful characters. There is much history interspersed throughout the book alongside enjoyable romantic musings. The story is told from two different POV’s: a young brother and sister (late teens -20) plus Irish sister-in-law from the east AND an older married couple (but still young - late 20’s/early 30’s) already in California. As the story bounces back and forth, it does so quite easily and the reader begins to see the need for additional volumes...I’m off to start #2 right now!"
791,0,"I usually enjoy Tracie Peterson, but I struggled with continuing to read  this book.  Two characters continually repeated the same thoughts, one character was foolish, continuing to behave recklessly all the while claiming  God would protect her.  Twice I set the book aside, reading something else.  I persevered thinking I would find out what happened to at least some of the characters, but NO, it's a cliffhanger.  You have to buy the next book for ten dollars and hope you find out how it ends."
792,0,"The book started out rather stilted and improbable, and I almost quit reading it.  But then, suddenly, it came alive and I was caught up into the edge-of-my-chair adventure along with the compelling, completely believable characters and could not put the book down.  I liked the ending, and look forward to discovering where the story goes in the next book."
793,0,It is so good to find clean books that sweep me along on fascinating journeys.
794,0,"This review started as a comment on one of the other reviews, a negative one.  I'm going to leave it intact but it will read awkwardly.  My first Miles LP was Nefertiti which I purchased in 1968, so I've been a fan for a while.  I bought Bitches Brew way back when and probably played it once.  I kept waiting for someone to take a solo and found it boring.  I have always liked the first side of Jack Johnson, especially the beginning through the end of MIles' solo, which is probably my all time favorite solo by him.  I bought Get Up With It way back when and probably forced myself to play it once.  Who wants to hear Miles play organ?"
795,0,"So starting this book my collection was covered for the Bird recordings and the Prestige box with Trane, Columbia box with Trane, 60s quintet box, On the Corner, Fillmore, Birth of Cool.  Reading this made me realize the big gap between Birth of Cool and Trane.  I bought Bag's Groove especially for the two Monk cuts but I feel like I need more there, especially the Sonny Rollins sides."
796,0,Which brings me to the electric stuff and the comeback stuff.  Reading the book got me to rebuy Bitches Brew on CD and to relisten to On the Corner.  I have to say this book has helped me to accept those recordings on their own terms and not as letdowns from the mid 60s.  The book has also encouraged me to try a comeback album and I've ordered We Want Miles since that gets pretty positive reviews.
797,0,"What got me to write and amend my original comment and then turn it into this review were all the negative comments from reviewers who slam with author for his opinions of the electric period.  I saw lots of positive comments by the author here and inclusions of positive reviews.  It is certainly not all positive but it is not nearly as negative as some would have you believe.  The thing is that many of those electric albums do not fit any definition of jazz that I am familiar with.  They are music, Black Music as Miles would say, but not really jazz.  Anyone who first met acoustic Miles would have to be disappointed when he took that direction.  Seems that some of our reviewers here started with electric Miles and they get pretty bent out of shape when you question that music, as did most of his piers way back when.  So I'm glad for this book.  I'm glad that it helped me appreciate the music I couldn't formerly get into.  What follows are my first couple of passes at a comment on a very negative review."
798,0,"As I work my way through this book I get the feeling this reviewer is way more biased than the author, who he accuses of bias. Should the author set aside his opinions about what he is writing about? While I am just finishing up the first half I have seen instances where he quotes reviews that are contrary to his own for the sake of inclusiveness and objectivity. And your comments about the author's feelings about the autobiography are really nothing more than your own ""fever dream""."
799,0,"As for the value of the autobiography, I'll follow Miles' lead. He spent most of his career trying to get people to judge only the music and not him the person. He'd turn his back or leave the stage when he wasn't playing, for instance. Miles is an interesting guy but I read this book because his music and the development of his music is what I'm interested in, not his sex life or the drugs he took."
800,0,"Putting down On The Corner is sacrieligious only in the Church of Miles the God. That is just one of many crazy comments here. I haven't got to the Jack Johnson part and I'm anxious to read that. I love Jack Johnson, especially side one with my all time favorite Miles solo. But I also own the Complete Jack Johnson and I see how it was assembled from different pieces. It was not an organic performance. While there are elements of Jazz there with some great improve I'm not sure I fully call it jazz. It is music, great music, but the producer had a lot to do with the finished product."
801,0,Back in the 70s I bought a double Miles LP that basically (as I remember) consisted of him noodling on an electric keyboard. Same guy who played on Kind Of Blue and Nefertiti but way way boring. He created a lot of important work but he wasn't perfect and everything he did isn't genius.
802,0,"...Update: I'm into the final couple chapters now and I have a couple impressions on the ""electric' reviews. First, they aren't all entirely negative. He also cites other reviewers for concerts and LPs that may be positive. The musicians from this period get a lot of positive input. From my listening of Bitches Brew and On the Corner I think he conveys the sound and structure of these discs fairly well. There are a lot of places where there isn't much happening besides a rhythmic churn. Sometimes I like, sometimes I don't. For me the Pinnacle of Miles is the 60s quintet. I think Nefertiti was my first Miles album. I think his trumpet playing was best in that period and the conception of the music was the most advanced. We have all that earlier music to color our opinions of him. I doubt Miles would be so highly thought of if we only had the post-Jack Johnson music."
803,0,"A couple disappointments: When he mentions the beginnings of ""jazz rock"" from the rock side he mentions the obvious pop bands like BST and Chicago, but my memory is that the first people to add horns were Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield with Electric Flag. The Butterfield band when Bloomer was still there was the most musically capable group of nonjazz musicians at that time. They do a very nice job of Nat Adderley's Work Song on their second LP. That the author mentions none of this is disappointing and maybe points to a lack of first hand knowledge of that music from that period. Later Bloomfield played as a guest on a Woody Herman album."
804,0,"My other disappointment was the review of Jack Johnson. Side one, especially the first half will always be my favorite electric Miles Davis. Most reviewers of this album highlight the funky guitar that starts side one by McLaughlin and the fantastic, out front solo by Miles: very declamatory and aggressive unlike much of his electric playing."
805,0,A fine book.
806,0,"But Chambers is also slightly upset, I think, that Quincy Troupe got to work with Miles on his autobiography and not he -- and what Chambers' book is missing is exactly the kind of personal material (and voice) you find in Miles' autiobiograpy (""Miles"")."
807,0,"The best thing about this book is the discussion of the wider context of Miles' music and performance (""the times""), but without Miles own voice it degenerates through the end of Part Two into a kind of annotated discography (mind you -- that's not all bad -- it is accurate and gave me a few ideas for out of the way purchases)."
808,0,"So, I recommend reading both this book and ""Miles"", for a complete picture."
809,0,"Detailed history of Miles Davis's development as a jazz pioneer.  Not an easy read... but definitely informative and full of historical gems.  Worth reading for any serious Miles fans, jazz aficionados, and those interested in how art and artists influence their times."
810,0,"what a great book! More insights than all the other things on Miles I've ever read. the book was in great shape, got to me quickly."
811,0,"Yes, sir."
812,0,"Those looking for detailed commentary on just about every Miles Davis recording session should turn to this book, while John Szwed's So What beats it on the subject of Miles' personal life.  Chambers' source material was all second-hand, for he apparently conducted no interviews himself for the project. Since the mid-80's publication of Milestones a treasure trove of new archived letters, documents, and interviews has become available from both Davis and his associates, but Chambers did an outstanding job nonetheless without it.  In fact, Miles himself borrowed, or stole if you will, from Milestones for his own autobiography to fill in the gaps in his memory of events.  At an exhaustive 800-plus pages, Milestones 1 and Milestones 2 (combined in the hefty paperback edition), really can't be beat."
813,0,"I haven't read every Miles Davis bio - in particular, John Szwed's more recent book has gotten good reviews and therefore may end up replacing this one as a standard, comprehensive reference."
814,0,"""Comprehensive"" is probably this book's biggest asset - it tries to cover every item that Davis recorded (and released) before the mid-1980s.  Written by a non-musician, it is accessible to laymen."
815,0,"Unfortunately, there are significant shortcomings.  Probably foremost is the author's bias against Davis's music from 1965 onward.  Reading his commentary on the 2nd quintet and electric eras, you get the feeling that he doesn't ""get"" the music and is incapable of discussing it in an insightful manner.  This is not the place to go for a substantive discussion of Sorcerer, B's Brew or Agharta.  These shortcomings also come through in his commentary of the cultural context for post-1965 recordings."
816,0,"There are also numerous errors in the discographical sections.  Some of this couldn't have been avoided (when Chambers wrote the book, he didn't have the extensive online sessionographies we have today).  Other mistakes are fairly obvious to serious listeners, and make me wonder whether Chambers actually listened to the recordings he reviews.  Either way, for this information you're better off using another source."
817,0,"Finally, Chambers uses no primary sources.  This is a real shame as he wrote the book when Miles and a larger number of his sidemen were alive.  His secondary sources are fairly wide-ranging, but surely we could have gotten more insight from the musicians themselves."
818,0,"One aspect that was not a shortcoming to me, but may be more problematic to others, is the relatively cursory discussion of Davis's personal life.  It's discussed when necessary, but Chambers is much more interested in the music than the man."
819,0,"When I picked up this book, I had maybe 15-20 Miles Davis albums and this volume piqued my interest enough to pick up many more.  In particular, his discussion of the Christmas Eve 1954 prompted me to run out and get ""Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants"".  So if that's where you're at, go ahead and pick up this book.  If, instead, you're interested, you're interested in picking a thoughtful, thorough and accurate discussion of Davis's music, you're better off going elsewhere."
820,0,"This book was a tough read for me (and apparantly for most of the reviewers before me), as I had read excerpts from it years ago and it infuriated me and interested me simultaneously. I had already read Miles' Autobiography, Ian Carr's 'The Definitive Biography' (which may not have been definitive, but was a much more level-headed, even-handed and sympathetic work than this could ever dream of being), 'So What', 'The Man With The Green Shirt' and the 'Downbeat Hall of Fame Reader' books on Miles, so I believe I already had a grasp on the man as much as anyone needs to dwell on the demons, drugs and dirt that were NOT the embodiment of this great shamanistic genius. Great artists don't ask or need to be liked or loved personally to be appreciated for their contributions to an art form, and no one in jazz made more contributions than Miles."
821,0,"More a critique and discography than a true biography, this book by Chambers suffers from a virulent lack of objectivity when it covers anything from 'In a Silent Way' onwards; this probably due to the fact that it was originally written prior to the reassessment and re-release of Miles' work from 1969 onward. In the same exact way that all jazz journalists who once lauded and benighted the incomparable Tony Williams when he was a member of the Quintet later turned on him like rabid scrap yard dogs when he formed Lifetime and began the Jazz-Rock movement (it was Tony, not Miles who ushered in this new genre, truth be told - Miles gave birth to fusion, and there IS a difference), declaring him a turncoat and dismissing his entire output thereafter; the purists also reviled and detested Miles for his embracing this new music and incorporating it by going electric. The same thing happened to Dylan when he plugged in; the folkies declared him a sellout and blasphemer. To trash albums like 'On the Corner', 'Big Fun' and 'Jack Johnson' is not just short-sighted, it's downright sacrilegious. Chambers' refusal to neutrally assess these works among others, instead offering vapid opinions and utilizing/quoting other like-minded reviewers from those days to lend credence to bolster his argument make me wonder if he and Albert Goldman (who wrote the criminally disgraceful bio on John Lennon) were journalistic roommates. Biased, bitter, condescending and sometimes highly inaccurate, this book infuriated me after I decided to finally submit and read it. Tip: take your blood pressure meds before you embark on this journey."
822,0,"Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I will state that this book provides a wealth of information about recording dates, historical perspectives, album dissections and probably the best overview of his output up to 'Silent Way'. If you're only going to read one book on Miles, read his autobiography. If you read two, this is also essential, though be warned that you won't really like the man himself after putting it down - it's that distorted. Add Carr's 'Definitive Bio' and 'So What' to the list and you'll really come to grips with this eternal enigma. When a giant of this stature has lived and himself created as many legends as Miles, and those who met him fabricate twice as many tales to make themselves a part of this history, the exaggerations will undoubtedly blossom corruptively into an even larger and less accurate picture that won't be very pretty. Who cares? It's the music, not the toilet-flushings that will forever be remembered. This is an important book on the most important figure in jazz, but it suffers from the resentful fever dream of a writer who cannot reconcile why he wasn't asked to co-author the autobiography instead of Quincy Troupe. (Maybe he should have been). Not that I'm enamored with Troupe either; his vacuous follow-up penned after Miles had passed, 'Miles and Me', had nothing good to state after the great man had gone; groping for substance everywhere and finding none, he resorted to making blind, completely unfounded allegations like Miles had a sexual predator relationship with Tony Williams when he was underage(WTF). Despicable comments from seemingly despicable people, bio writers are a blasphemous, bottom-feeding bunch attempting to elevate themselves while they smash the pedestals they once built for others. It's like Frank Zappa said - ""Writing about music is like dancing about architecture"". This may be an essential read, but not an endearing one..."
823,0,"Jack Chambers has done a very hard task and that is to present the life of the legendary Miles Davis to readers in a very interesting, yet complex style which was reflective of the way Miles Davis led his life and music."
824,0,"Miles Davis was the premiere jazz musician of his time along with John Coltrane, Charlie ""Bird"" Parker, Herbie Hancock, etc, yet while you can love Davis's music, to know the man was very hard to do, since Miles Davis was a standoffish and sullen individual.  Chambers describes Davis's behavior as being sullen and hard to know because Davis's was a very shy man.  I am sure that Davis lived a tough life because of injustice, yet it is sad that he didn't trust his fans and those who cared for him.  Davis certainly lived the life of a ""star"", he over-indulged in sex, was an abuser of drugs, and had split personalities later on in life, yet his musical vision was almost always focused and clear, whether it be in the pinnacle of his talent (1950-1962), or his creating fusion (1967-1973), or the later part of his life."
825,0,"Chambers does an excellent job of detailing the relationship Miles had with his fellow musicians such as the love-hate relationship with Theolonius Monk, the admiration and jealousy between Coltrane and Miles, as well as Miles being a mentor to such jazz greats as Herbie Hancock, John McGlaughlin, Chick Corea, etc."
826,0,"I am a tremendous fan of Miles Davis jazz visions, I love his music and his musical style, yet after reading this book I feel sadness because I don't know if I pity Davis or just not liking him altogether, or admiring him no matter what, his final years were spent in paranoia, suspicion and feeding his ego, that is sad because if he would of just relaxed and enjoy his fans admiration I believe he might have lived longer.  Anyways, this is an outstanding book and is highly recommended to all jazz lovers and fans of the immortal Miles Davis."
827,0,"By the time I found out about Jack Chambers' Miles biographies (two volumes, originally) they had been combined into this single book with some new material that brings the original manuscripts from the 1980's up to  date. Despite the heading on this site, this is the complete 800-odd page  monster bio, not an ""introduction""!"
828,0,"This is a fantastic bio.  Like many other critics and older fans who were raised on jazz, Chambers  can't really relate to Miles' work from the late 1960's onwards, but he  does give it comprehensive coverage, rather than pretend that it all ended  with ""The Quintet"". I'm not sure that criticisms about his  quoting reviews are justified. I saw it as just being thorough - giving  details of the critics' reactions to recordings rather than just his own. I  learned much from his chronicling of events, right through to the  seventies, that I did not know."
829,0,"If you are a fan of Miles' final period  (1981 comeback to his death in 1991), then you're probably the only one who  will feel short-changed. As this was not a period that interested me  greatly, I was not particularly bothered (probably exhausted by then!)."
830,0,A  really professional effort.
831,0,"I am an avid reader, approximately 100 books per year on a variety of topics and themes.  I have to say that The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger is one of the most unreadable books I have ever encountered.  I powered through over half of the book before I asked myself;  WTH am I spending my time reading this nonsense.  I will never attempt to finish this book due to the intense boredom of it.  I can't say more than that except don't waste your time."
832,0,"I don't understand the fascination with this series, much less Stephen King.  Most of his books end up with an alien monster.  This one ended up in the trash."
833,0,"Stephen King says he started his epic series, THE DARK TOWER, when he was a very young man. Perhaps with the arrogance and/or enthusiasm of youth this series is a mash-up of any number of literary traditions. In most hands it could have wound up a mess."
834,0,"THE GUNSLINGER, the first in the series, opens, appropriately enough, with “the gunslinger” chasing an unidentified man across a nameless desert:"
835,0,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”"
836,0,"The scene has the look and feel of an old spaghetti western, which King freely admits:"
837,0,“… I realized that what I wanted to write was a novel that contained Tolkien’s sense of quest and magic but set against Leone’s almost absurdly majestic Western backdrop.”
838,0,I think he succeeded:
839,0,"“The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way…”"
840,0,The Gunslinger (eventually we learn is name is Roland – an epic/mythic/heroic name) comes across a mysterious young man who has somehow been transported from (our) contemporary New York to this strange land. No attempt is made at explanation.
841,0,"When Roland comes to a town, we learn that this is post-apocalyptic time in which the world as we know it has been destroyed, possibly though nuclear war. It is a dystopian vision that predates the current popularity of such stories."
842,0,"As the journey continues, old-fashioned magic becomes part of the mix. Also a bit of derring do in the style of Indiana Jones. Also some fantasy in the vein of George R. R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” (“Winter is coming.”)"
843,0,"And, of course, questions of good versus evil are explored."
844,0,Whew.
845,0,"Any type of cross-genre mixing is difficult to do well, much less on an epic scale. I have not even looked at subsequent books in the series in the hopes of being continually surprised when I do read them. I expect this volume is a good launch. If anybody could make it a success it would in the hands of Stephen King."
846,0,Confusion and Unmoored Sufferings
847,0,"While reading this book, it almost seemed like the author was creating confusion and misery for misery and confusion’s sake!  Why would you do that in the first book of a series?  If Stephen King’s name wasn’t on this book, I sincerely doubt most readers would have finished reading it.  That said after completing the book I googled it and found King’s fans encouraging people to “power” through the book because book two is good, while on the same page I found others talking about underage sex that is weird in further editions of the series.  This leads me to one question:"
848,0,"“Why did you create such frivolous misery in your novel Mr. King?”  Apart from Jake, it just seems like pain that neither builds the character, nor furthers the story.  It is, to me, uninteresting and does nothing but sear and jade your reader’s imagination."
849,0,"This book was much less interesting than some less known/self-published smaller authors today like AC Cobble, Peter Flannery, A.G. Riddle and others.  In fact this being the first Stephen King book I’ve ever read, I was left wondering if the only reason he has been so popular was due to the advertisements of his brand over the years.  After all, prior to Amazon a writer could not easily get their works known or published.  I now wonder if King is really deserving of his lofty place amongst well known literary authors."
850,0,"The final quarter of this book from the flashback of Roland’s “coming of age” through the cave onward was decent and even good occasionally, but prior to that I wanted to stop reading the book several times."
851,0,"Maybe my review is unfair, but this doesn’t seem like a work worthy of one of the past century’s most popular authors.  Read it if you must, or just read the cliff’s notes version and save yourself some pointless misery."
852,0,"There are many Stephen King books that I really enjoy (Salems Lot, Finders Keepers, The Stand, 11/22/63 just to name a few . . . in fact, 11/22/63 is one of my all-time favorite books).  As such, I really had high hopes for The Gunslinger.  However, the story line was disjointed, confusing, and not very enjoyable at all.  I kept expecting the flow of the book to smooth-out and become a ""cannot put down"" read.  However, this never occurred.  In the end, I was completely disappointed.  I have heard that other Dark Tower books are much better, but I disliked The Gunslinger so much that I'm not sure I'll read any others."
853,0,Once one of my all time favorite books.
854,0,"Stephen King revised this book and it is TERRIBLE!!!  You get no back story and don’t know who some of the characters are, how they played a roll in Roland’s life, what he went through to get to where he is now. NOTHING!!!  It is terrible!!"
855,0,"In terms of story, this is easily the best volume in the series so far. The characters and setting have so much depth, and we learn much about who they all are and why they've been thrust together on this ongoing, epic journey."
856,0,"And this story FEELS epic, too, as Roland and his band of unlikely heroes traverse miles and miles from the first page to the last. The setting and descriptions are all wonderful - you can see, hear, and smell everything the characters are... for good or ill, because some of the places the characters find themselves in are pretty bleak, to say the least."
857,0,"The only problem is that it ends on a cliffhanger. Which ordinarily, would be cause for an immediate one-star review from me, and a solemn vow to never read another book in the series. But because this is Stephen King, and because I've been mostly happy with the series so far, I'm going to press on and give it another shot."
858,0,"Then, the Kindle Edition I read is riddled with typos. Most of these are probably OCR issuess from scanning a print edition of this book, but it just smacks of plain laziness on the part of the publisher. I've reported them all as ""Quality Issues"" on Amazon."
859,0,"I know these are supposed to be the great Stephen King epic, but after three books and NOTHING happening I give up. I don't even care about the characters and he has spent 3 books developing them. He is constantly making references to the pop culture of the 1980s so I,m guessing in 10 years or so no one will know what he's talking about. There are better books to read I'm done."
860,0,Roland went for a walk in the desert.  He had a mule with no name.  Did he feel good to get out of the rain?  I can't remember  ...  the palaver left me too numb to care for his pain.
861,0,"This might be a useful introduction to an epic series,  but the story does not stand in its own."
862,0,"Reading this series again, after King finally concluded it - and though it's been over a decade since my first reading of the gunslinger's ka-tet, it's like my old friends have been waiting for my return. In this slice of the tale, the other characters start coming into their own and King draws his characters a deeper hue, layering meaning and darkening shadows."
863,0,"It's a tense ride, a fulfilling adventure and page-turner that starts to eat away at your sleeping hours. Be warned, I think these pages are laced with some addictive substance...maybe Eddie's been at it again. I can't stop reading this series."
864,0,"If you've read the novels this far, you want to know how it all ends.  The translator, however, in his preface, indicates that many things contribute to this volume seeming convoluted and straying from the general theme of the previous books.  First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition."
865,0,"You get some closure--the story draws to an end and homage is paid to the theological theme of realizing the primacy of the spiritual world over the material world.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say that you are expecting a fall from grace with a stalwart conviction that life isn't over--a Chinese version of the Book of Job--but you get a lot of deus ex machina events that give it more of a fairy tale ending than what Cao Xueqin hinted at throughout the first three volumes."
866,0,Part of my culture
867,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
868,0,This novel definitely deserves its place in the topmost tier of global literature.  I was not convinced of that until I reached this volume. Amazing that it came to such a complete and inevitable conclusion when it had to be finalized after the author's death by others.
869,0,"I read all  5 volumes of this translation of the 18th Century Chinese novel known as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. The stone in question is a small magic jade found in the mouth of the newborn Jia Baoyu. It is the story of the journey through life of that stone and the beautiful young man Bao-yu. Written 300+ years before Downton Abbey this is also a story of a family, the fabulous mansion and garden they live in and the complicated relationships they have with their many servants. Poetry, painting, landscape and architecture, flowers, herbal medicines, Taost priests and Buddhist monks, rape, murder, thievery, jealousy, corruption, death and beauty dance through the pages like nothing else I have ever read."
870,0,"I've read all parts of The Story of the Stone.  It starts and ends in a mystical fashion; coming full circle in a traditional ying/yang way.  Wonderful five volume story about two wealthy families closely connected to the throne.  Although there's not much known about the true author, I suspect that it was written by a maid.  There is incredible detail from the perspective of the servents working for their sometimes nutty employers.  The family actually built a garden at one point in honor of a visit from a daughter who had been chosen to be a royal concubine.  If you want to immerse yourself in the ups and downs, daily life, (warts and all) of 1750's Chinese culture don't miss The Story of the Stone et al."
871,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
872,0,Great series.
873,0,This is the fifth and final installment in the classic Chinese story.  It gives a feel for cultural history of the Chinese people.
874,0,"Read it for a literature class in college. Interesting story, would recommend. This is book 5 of a 5 book set. Each book has 24 chapters."
875,0,This is a great new translation of one of the most significant classic Chinese novels. An 18th Century Saga of a noble family that falls from grace.
876,0,The Chinese names are cleverly replaced with western names that make the plot much easier to follow.
877,0,"Fun train ride through what is left of the town. Very interesting to read the history of the town once you have seen it. Well put together, lots of great photos."
878,0,"A unique and troubled time in America's past when dollars were more important than workers lives or the health of the natural environment. Coal barons raped the landscape, tore up the mountains, spoiled the rivers, treated miners and their families horribly and pretty much did what they darn well pleased."
879,0,"I was a competitive swimmer as a kid, and now I've returned to the pool after more than 25 years to try to become a competitive masters swimmer."
880,0,"The basics came back like riding a bicycle (except for the butterfly, which I couldn't remember how to do at all) but a lot has changed over the years, and my technique was clearly rusty."
881,0,"I don't have a coach, doing it on my own, and this book has been a tremendous help... and I'm not even done with it!"
882,0,"The tips on a proper catch, and their little listening trick to correct hand entry, took 2 full strokes off my pool length in freestyle, for example."
883,0,"This week I used their 4 phase method for learning butterfly to teach myself the stroke, and did my first pool lengths in fly.  I'm looking forward to using their other tips to refine the stroke and start adding it into my regular workout."
884,0,This is just a tremendous book.  Easy to read and follow.
885,0,"I strongly recommend it for anyone starting out, or making the transition from fitness swimming to competition, or returning to the water after a long time away."
886,0,Definitely worth many times the cover price.
887,0,My swimming background.
888,0,"I have been a swimmer all of my life. I swum competitively since the age of 12, began swimming Masters in 1978. I have been coaching masters in 1998. Like most masters coaches I always emphasized strokes and  seasonal conditioning periodizatuion meven though like most masters teams only about 1/3 of the swimmers compete. Even my swimmers who don't compete enjoy the variety. Also, we have growing number of triathletes most of whom were not from a competitive  swimming background."
889,0,"Ahl off this to is to say that this the most useful information and tools one book that hi have found. If you want to coach masters or you are a swimmer wants to improve you own swimming or to help your coach, BUY THIS BOOK! If you are a triathlete who wants to learn to "" swIm like a swimmer"" buy the book, but also find a masters team with a coach who emphasizes stroke instruction over long sets without technical instruction./"
890,0,Only had this book for a day and it's already given me so much information on anything I've had questions on. It goes straight into detail on every strokes and how to be properly prepared and what you should do before meets and what levels you feel comfortable with. I recommend for people like me who have a little late start in pursuing the swimming dream.
891,0,"Some Parts May be lacking in detail, but this overall targets the fears and weaknesses of the newbie swimmer. It has definitely improved my view on technique in stroke, breathing, and the importance of psychological stability in water."
892,0,"If you aren't that good at swimming, and you want to swim faster, stronger, and enjoy the water, then this book is for you"
893,0,"This is a great book.  It has a lot of drills, which if followed, will enhance you swimming skills.  Jim Montgomery has a lot of information he is willing to share."
894,0,the difference between this book and the other kindle books available on swimming technique is that it includes a section on open water swimming. I was surprised to see this. Usually that gets skipped in beginners books.
895,0,Good reference book for Masters swimmers.  You can always pick up a tip or two.  This book has lots of them.
896,0,"I was a swimmer my whole childhood, but dropped it when in highschool. Last year, I finally started swimming again. This book is an amazing tool for perfecting stroke technique and swimming mechanics. It also has some very interesting information on training, as well as cool drills and clear pictures."
897,0,This book is an introductory book of what swimming is.
898,0,Despite well written an not boring most of those that had some back ground in swimming will not find new things or methods.
899,0,Although it is a good introduction for someone that wants to know a bit more about the world of swimming.
900,0,I am adult learner and this book has proven so beneficial. VERY methodical and practical.
901,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
902,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
903,0,This book is superb. I have read the Chinese version. Mr Hawkes' work is not only a translation but a gloss on the original text in modern language albeit in English.
904,0,"This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing."
905,0,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
906,0,"I have now read all three volumes of the David Hawkes' translation of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' and I am simply blown away by the sheer volume of the text, and how there is never a dull moment. Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."

915,0,"Man oh man, this is one bittersweet book, folks. It's the sunset of an era for the Jia family, and everyone and their dog knows it. Dai-yu, Bao-yu, Xi-feng, and nearly half of the characters are either sick or depressed. Anything not nailed down is being pawned off out the yinyang. Prospect Garden empties out its beautiful girls. Hell-- things are so bad, the servants can't even keep the damn gates locked at night. As Xi-feng bemoans when trying to bean-count the family's way out of bankruptcy, the Jias are slaves to their own past good fortunes and it's about time that the chickens come home to roost."
916,0,"To be frank, it doesn't have the spellbinding whimsy of the The Golden Days, or the splendorous atmosphere of The Crab-Flower Club. What The Warning Voice does have, however, is a helluva mood. True to its spirit of Taoism, the characters are liberated by their own true natures, and entrapped by spider webs of their own design:"
917,0,"In the first half, the girls of Prospect Garden explore their talents, their ambitions, and even their sexualities and genders. One girl pretends to be the wife of another girl until it feels real, while one of Bao-yu's servants begins to adopt a male persona. And both are treated with such wonder, sensitivity, and total lack of sensationalism that it sneaks up on you. But all it takes is some jealous and irrational busybodies, and next thing you know -- Bao-yu is wandering an empty garden."
918,0,"I wanted to yell at this book for how it puts these people, who I feel like I've known since they were boys and girls, through terrible misery. At the center of the impending disasters is Dai-yu, because like a flower, she is blooming into something beautiful -- and also very, very, very, VERY not long for this world. Bao-yu, meanwhile, is shaping up to be quite a sensitive, smart, and caring man...just in time to wave goodbye to her."
919,0,"The most bittersweet thing of it all is knowing there's two more volumes, and things must get worse before they get better. And it's bittersweet to move on without David Hawkes as the trusty translator, my companion through this foreign world (I sure hope the next volume explains why he stopped, because half the joy is cross-referencing his translation with the Chinese, and appreciating Hawkes's good sense and creativity). But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."
920,0,"A continuation of David Hawkes' beautiful translation of the amazing 18th century Chinese novel begun in Volume I (The Golden Days).  This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call ""plot.""  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.  We get to experience the life of the Jia family and their relatives at the height of their success, before their inevitable decline.  This is, after all, Buddhist China, and in Buddhism, everything is about transience."
921,0,"It's kinda silly how much I loved reading this, when spoiled Chinese aristocrats writing poetry really ought to be boring. But then a scene comes along like Bao-chai and Dai-yu exchanging insults disguised as jokes, and Tan-chun speaks up:"
922,0,"'Pinch her lips, Chai!' she said. 'You should hear what she's been saying about you.'"
923,0,"'I don't need to,' said Bao-chai. 'One doesn't expect ivory from a dog's mouth!'"
924,0,"And I literally said out loud, ""Woof, girl!"" and kept on chugging along."
925,0,"Sure, I did miss the really weird parts of Volume I. So much nothing happens in this second volume. But that's okay, because there are also some tremendously tender moments of affection. Bao-yu doting on his maids to keep them warm; Xi-feng and Patience rigging a card game so Grandmother can win; Or Dai-yu taking Caltrop under her wing and making a real poet out of her. For all the back-biting these women and men in the Jia family do, they also express deep love in small, subtle ways."
926,0,"--But, boy, there's also some sudden and violent bursts of life in between. People die or get beaten within an inch of death, and we just move on to the next scene. Constantly moving on forward and forward, with a little growing tinge of melancholy left behind in the background. And it's that satisfying mix of fantasy, realism, sweetness, and godawful depression that makes me corny in love for this story."
927,0,"Compared to other translations of this book, this is by far the easiest, most comprehensible, and most fluid flowing translation out there. Even though it is an English translation, the translation captures the original's intent and purpose, without too much verbosity.  And what makes this translation stand out is its inclusion of an appendix that discusses in depth relevant historical facts that the reader may find useful or interesting as they read the novel."
928,0,"One complaint, the poems are not beautifully crafted and a lot of the original's subtle beauties are lost in translation. Both of these complaints are understandable. It is impossible to bring the greatness of this novel in its entirely from one language to another without losses. Though, It is a little sad not being able to fully absorb and enjoy everything the original has to offer. One possible solution, learn Chinese well enough to read the original in its mother language."
929,0,"The book arrived with so much protective packaging it could have survived a nuclear blast. Aside from its physical properties, the second volume was just as fun and exciting and detailed as the first. Can't wait to read the next 3 novels!"
930,0,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading ""Twilight"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng."

Character development is strong and the best poetry is in this volume."

936,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
937,0,"This is a masterful approach to the primary themes and characters of the greatest of all Chinese novels. THE STORY OF THE STONE runs five (thick) volumes in length, has literally hundreds of characters, takes place in a very specific historical era, and mirrors both the religious and social practices of the time and also the broader political landscape in which the story takes place. I managed to love it the first time I read it even though I knew almost nothing about any of that, but successive readings have given me hundreds of questions, and this book has helped me find many answers. I'm not a scholar, so what matters to me is that this book, tough sledding though it can be at times, actually increases my enjoyment of one of my three or four favorite novels."
938,0,The editors made an inspired decision to aim this volume at both teachers and researchers. The result is a veritable treasure-trove of pedagogical insights and scholarship.
939,0,"Although the translation is atrocious, and the book is poorly redacted, it may be the most concise version ever made of this fantastic book, which should get a lot more credit in the West. Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English. Personally, some simple mistakes, repeated along the 1000 pages of the Romance, became very grating, like ""the Cao Cao's army""."

However I am thankful I persevered through the story.  I've always been a big Dynasty Warriors fan, and Redcliff is one of my favorite movies. It was great to get a more complete picture of the events of the Three Kingdoms, and all the little details and interactions.  A great read if you can make it through!"
945,0,"I was introduced to the world of Romance of the Three Kingdoms thanks to the Dynasty Warriors game, and decided I wanted to read to original work that the games were based on. This is actually the second copy of the story that I've bought; the first had a drastically different translation style -- Liu Bei was Liu Pei, Guan Yu was Kuan Yu, etc -- and it was off-putting enough that I found it difficult to follow."
946,0,"For those who are here because of the same reason I was, you'll be pleased to know that this printing shares the vast majority of the translations with the games we know and love. Sun Ce is Sun Ce, not Sun T'se!"
947,0,"One of the problems with ordering a book on Kindle is that you don't know its full length in pages. ""The romance of three Kingdoms must be a rather thick volume and it is more a historical chronicle than a romance. For a non-Chinese the profusion of names and places make it confusing ( a map and a register of persons would have helped ). So , although it is ineresting ,it is also tiring"

963,0,"“The Share” by Terence Taylor was an interesting bit of magical realism that explored the relationship between two fascinating characters whose apartments relatively overlap in time and space. “Smoked Butt” by Brian Egeston is an odd and grotesque bit of southern gothic. “Black Frontiers” by Maurice Broaddus is a nice bit of Weird West monster revenge. “The Arrangements” by Patricia E. Canterbury guideposts the situation a bit too obviously for my tastes, but the setting was excellent – I have a soft spot for small towns that harbor secrets."
964,0,"I first heard “Wilson's Pawn & Loan” by L. R. Giles on the Nightlight podcast, and anyone who enjoys these anthologies should add Nightlight to their podcatcher. “Milez to Go” by Linda D.

This one reminded me a lot of Shadowrun, in all the best ways."

And finally, Dues' upstairs, for while I would have expected her to deliver a dreaded ending, she gave us just the opposite! A child's innocence soon disappears but for reasons she doesn't understand. In conclusion, these three alone are the reason that I give this book a 5."
985,0,"VOICES FROM THE OTHER SIDE, edited by Brandon Massey, is a collection of short stories from many authors. In Eric Jerome Dickey's ""Harlem,"" which is both scary and laugh-out-loud funny in places, an inmate in an asylum makes friends with one of his nurses and gets way too involved with her, seducing her and finally making a date with her. Brandon Massey's story, ""Deadwoods,"" involves a huge tree that suddenly pops up in the yard of an unemployed suburbanite. What can he do to get rid of this evil smelling tree that harbors something frightening among its leaves? Brian Egeston's ""Smoked Butt"" is the story of a little girl delivering food to shut-ins. She has to travel through deep woods and her adventures are awesome and screamingly funny. In ""Good 'Nough to Eat,"" Rickey Windell George, has an unemployed man seeking work wherever he can find it. Dancing in a male revue in a club is not his idea of a good job but it's all he can find. This tale has a shocking ending that will leave you gasping."
986,0,"All the stories in the book were very good, each with its own shock value. Brandon Massey has put together a collection of stories - some funny, some horrifying - but all of them hold your interest and you find yourself wondering, as you read each one, how this particular one can possibly turn out. To the credit of the many writers, the end is always unexpected and sometimes downright zany. The writing style of Tananarive Due's ""Upstairs"" is reminiscent of Joplin's Ghost, while Terrence Taylor's ""The Share"" is heart wrenchingly realistic in a totally abnormal way. Maurice Broaddus, with his ""Black Frontiers"" brings us a taste of our lost history, along with Christopher Chambers' ""Leviathan,"" a smooth reading but frightening story about the Middle Passage. It is a book worth reading if you like looking over your shoulder or peering into dark corners."

989,0,"I as a pastor am reading this book to join in with several men in my congregation who are going through it. While I agree with the character qualities listed for a leader, I am struggling with the means to become that type of leader. For me, godly character comes from spending time in the presence of God, not from struggling to attain that character. Self-examination, which is good (see Psalm 139:23-24), should lead us to repentance and worship in the presence of God. It is only in the presence of the greatest good that my heart is transformed to be like Christ, which then gives me the motivation and strength to be the spiritual man I am called to be."
990,0,"I grew up under a theology that stressed holiness by human effort, and it is only after suicidal guilt that I finally began to understand how God transforms us through His grace. Identity must precede activity. This book seems to lay out the correct biblical qualities of a leader, but stresses the wrong means for how to get these qualities. They are not something that can be attained apart from an intimate love relationship with the one who gives them. Spend time with Jesus. Let Him love you. Let His beauty convince you that His ways are better than the other ways of living."
991,0,"A better leadership book is Crawford Loritts book, ""Leadership as Identity."""
992,0,"In the course of reading J. Oswald Sander’s Spiritual Leadership it is fascinating that the Lord brought me to a conversation that contained the usual perception about church leadership. Earlier in the evening a gentleman had expressed interest in being a pastor and then over dinner reiterated that when talk turned to his current work. He expressed a displeasure in his current vocation and so when I asked what type of work he would like, he indicated that in reality he doesn’t like to work which is why being a pastor interested him."
993,0,"Unfortunately spiritual leadership is often thought of in this way. This mindset it both saddening and maddening. It indicates a very low view of not just pastors, but all of those in leadership within the body of Christ and explains why we are content with just warm bodies rather than placing those both qualified and called into positions of leadership. Several years ago I was fortunate enough to read Spiritual Leadership for the first time and have considered it necessary reading for all believers. This month Moody Publishers is offering a redesigned of the updated version released 10 years ago. It’s worth noting that the only versions I have read have been updated and not the original, and in this latest release I see no discernible differences in the text from the 2007 update."
994,0,"Originally put together as a a series of lectures, the book version is both logical and thoughtful. One cannot read the book without appreciating the effort that Sanders has put forward in conveying the material. The author delves deep into the realm of leadership addressing not just qualifications as many are so used to, although Sanders elevates these points to higher integrity than most,  but he also tackles topics such as the pastor’s ability to read, write, and communicate. The final chapters convey the necessity of building up other leaders. Therefore, despite the shortness of the chapters, the material requires time to read because of the need to be both reflective on it and convicted by it. While deep, the points are cleanly made and the path of reading is done in a logical and sequential order so that readers can ponder all aspects of leadership from beginning to end. Therefore, readers can expect the initial chapters to cover qualifications of leadership, who should be a leader, and some basic insights for becoming a leader, while the rest of the book continues to cover the process of leading itself to the eventual stepping aside from leadership and training up others to continue the work."
995,0,"J. Oswald Sanders discussion points can be considered the ABC’s of leadership in that they are (a) advanced, (b) balance, and (c) comprehensive. Sanders conclusions about leadership are advanced beyond basic thinking. Instead, he challenges both modern notions about leadership and conveys just how much is involved in leading God’s people God’s way. Additionally, the author presents many aspects with a very balanced way, avoiding the pitfalls of going to one extreme or the other. For example in discussing essential qualities of leadership he tackles the topic of anger in such a way that shows its necessity, but cautious about unloving anger. Finally, Sanders is comprehensive, covering many topics that are easy to overlook like those mentioned earlier about abilities to read and write or spiritual qualities such as prayer. He also looks at areas that many are prone to put off or avoid, like disqualification, replacing leaders, and training up new ones. Such details combined with an emphasis on biblical authority makes Sanders book an easy recommendation."
996,0,"Perhaps my one complaint is not with Sanders’ teaching at all, but rather with the additions that the publisher and editors have chosen to put further. The updated edition includes questions for discussion, which generally are very appreciative because they stimulate thinking and application. However, the questions are often asked in such a way that suggests that all believers are called to spiritual leadership and seem to ignore whether or not that person has been called to such a position. To be clear, Sanders nowhere advocates this. I have never had access to the first release and so lament my inability to comment upon the editor’s updates and faithfulness to Sanders’ intentions in the original publication."
997,0,"One thing is certain: Sanders has a high regard for spiritual leadership as God’s work. Therefore, he conveys the seriousness with which it must be undertaken. It comes with great costs of energy, patience, pride, and so much more, and the author is certain to convey that to readers so that they understand the importance of spiritual leadership. Because he does this, the book is beneficial for all persons within the body of Christ and not just leaders (or potential leaders).

998,0,"Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher at no cost to me for the purpose of review. However, my review was not influenced in anyway by outside sources and instead is the result of my own response to the reading of the book (in fact, I did a review of this book several years ago also highly recommending it and my opinion of it has not changed since)."

While deep, Sanders’s made is points cleanly and his topics structured in a pleasant sequential and logical order, so that readers can contemplate all aspects of leadership.."
1001,0,"Sanders has a high regard for spiritual leadership as God’s work and he expresses the seriousness with which it must be undertaken. This makes the book beneficial for all persons within the body of Christ and not just leaders or potential leaders. Thus, I would highly recommend this book to all believers, but a must read for all leaders and aspiring leaders.  It is a timeless book that has the propensity to be used by God to transform his church if we would read and apply it’s principles."
1002,0,Spiritual Leadership showed me a different style of leadership than I learned in the Army and in business. This is about dealing with God on a spiritual level and relying on Biblical principles to do God's will. It's relying less on your own abilities and relying on God. Jeffrey W. Bennett author of 
1003,0,"This book was required reading for a Leadership class that I had to take. I am so thankful that it was. Spiritual Leadership is one of the best books ever written on Christian leadership. This book is a timeless classic in teaching the principles of leadership. Spiritual Leadership was written from two series of dynamic messages delivered to Christian Leaders overseas in 1964 and 1966. This is not a how to book; but a book that emphasizes walking in character, integrity, humility, and obedience to the Word of God."
1004,0,I really enjoyed reading this book. I plan to continually read this book through out the years to come. It is an excellent guide for any one who is considering becoming a leader. It is spiritually accurate. I wish someone had place this book in my hands or at least told me about this book twenty-five years ago. It would have saved a lot of heartache and unnecessary anxiety on my part.
1005,0,"Spiritual Leadership will help educate you on what it takes to be a leader for God. It will help anyone build a foundation to stand upon in any position of leadership in or out of church.  It teaches you how God honors, protects and vindicates those whom he has chosen as His leaders."

1009,0,Here is a classic but a very solid classic. I enjoyed taking a few teams through this book and actually am making this one of the required readings in our Church Leadership Pipeline.
1010,0,A few chapters in this book will get you to examining your own leadership and challenge you in how well you are really doing.

1012,0,"Sanders’ book is a challenging and exhaustive reference for any believer who aspires to leadership.  It is a difficult read because its pages are packed with concise and critical words of wisdom, and each requires analysis and application to one’s own life.  At the same time, it sets the bar very high for spiritual leaders and calls each of us to another level of achievement.  True spiritual leadership is a high calling that synthesizes natural gifts and abilities and spiritual gifts and abilities into a person who is extremely dedicated and focused."
1013,0,"This book is challenging to me in my own ministry, because I am beginning to recognize the hard work that it is to be a true leader.  It is not something to be taken lightly.  I will study the principles and essential qualities posed in this book much more deeply."
1014,0,The book is an updated version from 2007. I wanted the original text of the book. The publisher felt the writings were outdated and modern Christians wouldn't understand the archaic references. That's WHY I wanted it. The publisher also made the book gender inclusive. I wanted Sanders' original language so I could be the judge on whether he is taking about 'males' when he says 'man' or the human race.
1015,0,I am giving five stars as to not hurt the rating review as I know the content will be excellent once I read the original edition.

1019,0,"A continuation of David Hawkes' beautiful translation of the amazing 18th century Chinese novel begun in Volume I (The Golden Days).  This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call ""plot.""  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.  We get to experience the life of the Jia family and their relatives at the height of their success, before their inevitable decline.  This is, after all, Buddhist China, and in Buddhism, everything is about transience."
1020,0,"It's kinda silly how much I loved reading this, when spoiled Chinese aristocrats writing poetry really ought to be boring. But then a scene comes along like Bao-chai and Dai-yu exchanging insults disguised as jokes, and Tan-chun speaks up:"
1021,0,"'Pinch her lips, Chai!' she said. 'You should hear what she's been saying about you.'"
1022,0,"'I don't need to,' said Bao-chai. 'One doesn't expect ivory from a dog's mouth!'"
1023,0,"And I literally said out loud, ""Woof, girl!"" and kept on chugging along."
1024,0,"Sure, I did miss the really weird parts of Volume I. So much nothing happens in this second volume. But that's okay, because there are also some tremendously tender moments of affection. Bao-yu doting on his maids to keep them warm; Xi-feng and Patience rigging a card game so Grandmother can win; Or Dai-yu taking Caltrop under her wing and making a real poet out of her. For all the back-biting these women and men in the Jia family do, they also express deep love in small, subtle ways."
1025,0,"--But, boy, there's also some sudden and violent bursts of life in between. People die or get beaten within an inch of death, and we just move on to the next scene. Constantly moving on forward and forward, with a little growing tinge of melancholy left behind in the background. And it's that satisfying mix of fantasy, realism, sweetness, and godawful depression that makes me corny in love for this story."
1026,0,"Compared to other translations of this book, this is by far the easiest, most comprehensible, and most fluid flowing translation out there. Even though it is an English translation, the translation captures the original's intent and purpose, without too much verbosity.  And what makes this translation stand out is its inclusion of an appendix that discusses in depth relevant historical facts that the reader may find useful or interesting as they read the novel."
1027,0,"One complaint, the poems are not beautifully crafted and a lot of the original's subtle beauties are lost in translation. Both of these complaints are understandable. It is impossible to bring the greatness of this novel in its entirely from one language to another without losses. Though, It is a little sad not being able to fully absorb and enjoy everything the original has to offer. One possible solution, learn Chinese well enough to read the original in its mother language."
1028,0,"The book arrived with so much protective packaging it could have survived a nuclear blast. Aside from its physical properties, the second volume was just as fun and exciting and detailed as the first. Can't wait to read the next 3 novels!"
1029,0,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading ""Twilight"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng."

1037,0,"I bought iPad for Dummies a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed reading and using it. This book, although dated July 2014 actually has information in it that is out of date.  Another complaint is that it is printed cheaply, so when I use my yellow highlighter it smudges the page and my highlighter gets ink on it as well from the print.  The iPad for Dummies book had glossy pages, which were  high quality and there was no problem with using a highlighter.  Another problem is that this book is written for a number of different MacBook models so the reader must take in material that is not relevant for one's own model. I was sufficiently frustrated with this book that I went back to see if there are other manuals out there to learn how to use my new MacBook Pro, and I found Teach Yourself Visually MacBook Pro.  So far this is everything that the MacBook Dummies book is not: the pages are glossy, there are lots of color diagrams and photos, and it is specific to the MacBook Pro, so there isn't lots of extraneous information to deal with.  I am not a techy, so perhaps people who are more sophisticated would prefer the Dummies book.  For someone like me, The Teach Yourself Visually MacBook Pro book is ideal, and purchasing this MacBook for Dummies book was a mistake."
1038,0,"UPDATE: I am now using both books, since I had already purchased this one. I am finding that they complement one anoher.There is more background information in this one. All the color photos in the Teach Yourself Visually book are more pleasant as well as simple to follow"

I don't have a Macbook Pro YET, but I bought this book and the earlier version several years ago specifically to familiarize myself with Apple laptops before buying one.  This is very well written, and easy to understand.  Mark L. Chambers is one of my favorite Dummies writers for Apple products.  I recommend this new version of Macbook for Dummies."

The book has been a welcome transition aid as I have it loaded on my Kindle and the Kindle app. Easy to reference and use. Written in the typical ""for Dummies"" format that I am used to from other editions on other subjects."
1041,0,"The MacBook for Dummies is just the book I needed. I am new to the iMac and in my haste to get a ""manual"" (which did not come with the computer ),I ordered this book for Mac laptops for my Kindle. It serves the purpose. It explains the Apple computer in detail so that I can understand it and make it work for me. I was overwhelmed with my new iMac, but  now I have settled down to enjoy it and I really do love the book for making it so easy. It truly is the only ""dummy"" book you will need."
1042,0,I've been a fan of Dummies books since Windows 98 and Microsoft Office.  I recently decided to purchase my first Mac and with it the MacBook for Dummies.  I've created a small library of their books and not one has disappointed me.  This book is no exception.  The Mac vs Windows is a bit of a challenge easily handled by the MacBook for Dummies.  Excellent in ever way.  5 star for sure.
1043,0,"Great book if you are learning to navigate a MacBook with the new OS High Sierra. I am normally a PC guy, but was able to obtain a great MacBook Pro from my wife. Since I want to keep up with technology, I am increasing my interests in the Mac field too. Frankly, I know some, but not very much. So, this book really comes in handy. It does a great job in covering most of the basic areas you'll be using in a Mac to begin with. Those are the positive comments. The only reason I didn't give this five stars was because of the ""print"" in the book. It looks like it was printed on newspaper print! The lettering is faint and it's very hard to read unless you are near a bright light. If you are in a fairly lit room, it is a bit hard to read it. I think they could have done a better job on paper selection, and the ink or print they used for the book. Other than that, it's a great primer to get started in learning to navigate your MacBook."

There is absolutely no reference to the fact that if you want to send just a message to someone, you type it without paragraphs, and then hit enter. Probably 90% or more of the users would know this already or manage to hit on it eventually. But some of us just stopped trying to use that feature until we could find someone with a mac."

The LeVites book is in color and on premium paper. The LeVites book is the better of the two. I recommend that you buy both books and use them for reference. I found the best way to learn MacBook is on video on youtube and using the books as backup and reference."

1056,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
1057,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
1058,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
1059,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
1060,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
1061,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
1062,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
1063,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
1064,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
1065,0,"Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding ""Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad."""
1066,0,...ah! I love learning about other cultures!
1067,0,"But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly (""Who the heck is this person again?"" I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time."
1068,0,"Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him)."
1069,0,"But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work...."
1070,0,...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.
1071,0,"This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China (""Red Studies,"" from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, ""A Dream of Red Mansions""). It really should be read by every educated person."
1072,0,"  The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however."
1073,0,"  I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature."
1074,0,"  The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note."
1075,0,"  First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women)."
1076,0,"  Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses."
1077,0,"  Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead."
1078,0,"  Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure."
1079,0,"  Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others."
1080,0,  There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.
1081,0,"  Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia."
1082,0,"For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West (Americas, Europe) it might be a chore to get interested in this book. The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you. If you're interested in how life was lived in that part of the world, this book will be a masterpiece, as it has been in China itself."
1083,0,"One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature.  Five volumes and hundreds of characters. Has a modern feel, despite being more than two hundred years old. Fascinating book."
1084,0,"Rank and privilege in 18th century China. The family compound. Relation between relatives and the pecking order. The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs. Subjection of women is rife, but not without protest. This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived.  This is not a history book, it is a novel of customs, more about  what people thought, about respect, subservience and privilege  and mores."
1085,0,"One of the 4 classics of Chinese literature, it is a riveting and interesting read! Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature. Highly recommended."
1086,0,The book looks very aged/old with yellow pages. Disappointed
1087,0,This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature. The English translation here is very good. Even the poetry is well done
1088,0,"The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read)."
1089,0,A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.
1090,0,Excellent book!  An encouraging read!
1091,0,I love all of Oswald Chambers books and this was no exception.
1092,0,"I have been reading a great deal of Urban Fantasy, and I was very much up for a change of pace. This really hit the spot, as they say. I felt like the characters were cohesive, complex and shown to the reader from enough angles to make them feel alive and real. While they all spoke in the flowery speech considered polite, it was easy to tell their personalities from their particular speech habits. I am often cut-throat in my reviews about dialogue so it's refreshing to be able to compliment, not critique it in a review."
1093,0,"The best thing about this book was not the plot -- because this is a fairly old work the plot has many of the tropes we readers come to expect from this sort of work. They may seem cliched now because so many newer works have aped them. However, the descriptions are astounding -- detailed and precise yet not overlong or exhausting. It always maintains the perfect level to engross and trap the reader but not bore them. The 'movie' in my head was awash with wonderful detail, lush backgrounds and perfect costumes. I really haven't read description this good in a very long time."
1094,0,"However, the one thing I didn't care for was the three or four incidents of anachronism stew. Xifeng had a wrist watch centuries before they came into fashion, Baochai had a few too many modernisms in her speech and  the Chinese manners of gift-giving were ignored, possibly to make the work more appropriate for a western audience. If these had not stuck out of the narratives like sudden blotches of bright paint on a somber renaissance portrait, this would have been five stars. UPDATE -- the author has taken the time to address this paragraph in the comments. Please read her replies as they explain a great deal."
1095,0,"This is a translation....so there is usually some loss of understanding.  The book is massively long and the names of the characters are very confusing.  In the front of the book they give a geneology map...you've got to be kidding...no way to keep track....just keep on reading.  It does give a great description of the class system, the mores, and the discrimination that was present. However...I found it to be  an exhausting book to read  and I lost interest in the characters"
1096,0,One of the best books I've read about China during that time frame. I was able to relate to the different characters even though they were totally out of my frame of reference. I had sympathy for the various chactacters and the author
1097,0,Did a very credible job of explaining why they acted the way they did. I always like to think that when I am reading an
1098,0,"Historical novel I am learning much about the period, the place, the history, and how it affected those people that lived through it. I will not soon forget this wonderful novel. I am so glad that this author re-wrote this historical novel and made it simpler for the present readers. it must have been a difficult undertaking and I can see from Pauline Chen's impressive degrees that she truly was in a position to write such an intelligent book. Please write more!!!"
1099,0,I consider this story a fan fiction based on the original rather than a abridged version of the original considering the number of characters the author either kills off at the beginning or allowed to live till the end.
1100,0,The bad: It is written in present tense. Why did the author do this? It makes reading it more awkward. Four stars if it had not been written in present tense. Seems common for debut authors for some reason.
1101,0,"The good: It's an interesting, easy to read version of a very long plodding confusing classic. Her version of the ending is mostly believable (except the epilogue!) and the characters are well drawn if perhaps seemingly a bit different from the original."
1102,0,"Read this and then read the five volume version, you'll appreciated both more."
1103,0,I've been reading various versions and translations of  A Dream of Red Chambers since the mid 70's and approached this book with some trepidation. Well I enjoyed it so much I bought the audio book (which brought came with the extra bonus of learning the correct pronounciation of charactar's names) and have listened several times over which then leads to a re-reading of the original:-)
1104,0,BTW a set of unabridged audio books of ADoRC would be worth the expense...
1105,0,There were too many characters with names that I couldn't even pretend to sound out. The book was too long then just ended. I did not enjoy this book
1106,0,"suggest you read this book of you have an interest in China, it's customs and politics. The love stories may make this book appeal more to women."
1107,0,"I think this novel may have been received better had Chen creditted the Red Chamber rather than fashion this book as a retelling. The closed world of a family in standing within the classical world of its Emporors, feels like a peeping with Daiyu into a secret world.  I am intrigued with the linked lives of the women of this world and how they live out their lives often within a few rooms. Despite its failure to stand alone as ""The"" Red Chamber, Chen has brought us to a different way of seeing the world"
1108,0,"I have never read Dream of the Red Chamber but decided to pick up this novel as a condensed version of the aforementioned.  Pauline Chen's The Red Chamber is a captivating read from the get-go, especially in that it provides the right balance of historical context while not detracting from the depths of the main characters.  Some may be unhappy at the changes that have been made in this novel, but if it's taken as a separated, individual novel rather than a reworking of the classic, it will prove to be an enjoyable read.  I was caught up in the novel to the point that I was in tears by the end."
1109,0,"Descriptive, thought provoking, emotional. Very easy to read and I literally could not put the book down. The names of the characters took a little getting used to, but I soon got familiar with them. Highly recommend."
1110,0,"""The notebook"" was ordered for my wife after she saw the movie. She says that she rates it five stars."
1111,0,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
1112,0,It is one of the most impressive literary artworks I have ever been through. The life of one of the most prominent families during the Qing Dinasty is depicted with such a remarkable finesse and delicacy as to make the reader aware of the refinement of Chinese culture. Specially recommended for those who would like to be introduced to Chinese history by the hand of one of the finest writers of all times.
1113,0,"OMG the translation for this book was awful!!  I am sorry, but I would not dream of giving this book a positive review."
1114,0,Not my style!
1115,0,"Of course, this is a superior novel that's translated very well, indeed. However, this edition has been severely edited to the size of a novelette, which rather defeats the purpose of this long and detailed work. In fact, reducing the size of the work is pointless, even as an introduction."
1116,0,Read the first volume of this work to give you a real feeling for the book's complexity.
1117,0,"This addition is just a repackaging of the freely available 19th century public domain translation, which translation, by the way, is not even complete.  Don't waste your money."
1118,0,This is the worst of the several English translations of this book (Story of the Stone and A Dream of Red Mansions are much better). This version is also free from gutenberg. Why is amazon charging for it?
1119,0,did not read book yet but I know I will love it
1120,0,"It truly is a challenge to find a well written Christian novel.  I've only found a few and this is one of them. I don't know who the protagonist, Will Chambers, is modeled after or if he's a composite, but I would like to meet him or them! He is a very brilliant, insightful attorney. The story expertly combines Will's natural abilities with God's supernatural interventions, weaving them together to hold the reader's attention until the story is resolved on the final page!"
1121,0,"Grabbed from the beginning, this novel held me throughout. If you’re a lesser us better when it comes to government, this will drive you nuts. I found myself so engrossed with the drama unfolding that I began to join in with Will as he fights the system which had gone off the rails. A must read from an author who truly engages his readers."
1122,0,"As far as I'm concerned,  Mr. Parshall is #1 in the legal thriller  genre; better than John  Grisham.  He expertly weaves his stories through twists, turns and surprises. This story really carried me quickly through to the end. I read it in one day. I love that he includes Christianity in his books. His faith adds so much depth to the story. I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. As a former legal secretary,  I'm always fascinated by legal thrillers."
1123,0,"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall.  As with the first one, this is well done."
1124,0,The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse.  There are many twists and turns throughout.  The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.
1125,0,"In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues.  The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline.  That part is well done also."
1126,0,"I will certainly be checking out more books in this series.  I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."
1127,0,This is an excellent thriller series. Lots of action. You will not want to put it down. Read them in order.
1128,0,The premise is scary. This is an engrossing book I recommend you read this when you have a lot of time to read it
1129,0,"Enjoyed this one as much as the first book in the series.  Holds your interest.  And the characters are very ""real""."
1130,0,I look forward to the read. Thanks
1131,0,EXCELLENT READ. Would like to believe a lawyer could have this much feeling for jusice and the truth.
1132,0,"Of the five books in this series, I've only read the first two.  This book was more enjoyable than the first. I didn't want to put it down."
1133,0,"This thrilling mystery movie which has touches of horror and delves deeply into the paranormal was a quintessential ""whodunit"" which will keep you engaged and guessing until the very end. Cate Blanchet, the consummate  actress, offers another spellbinding performance, and Hillary Swank and Keanu Reeves provide excellent supporting roles. Giovanni RibisiI adds an additional powerful and convincing performance to the story as a very disturbed young man with whom Cate, the lead character, deals with compassionately. I never cease to be amazed at Cate Blanchet's ability to portray a role with such honesty and realism that you completely forget the person she portrays is a character in a movie."
1134,0,This was a surprisingly entertaining movie. Cate Blanchett was excellent and Giovani Ribisi had the most interesting character (his involvement was why I elected to watch this).
1135,0,"Blanchett plays a woman with ""gifts"" who gets involved with a murder investigation. She's not all knowing and her visions come in flashes that tend to terrify her as much as offer any insight. There is some effective camera work by Sam Raimi, although there is a bit of a tendency for kind of cheap thrills (surprise off screen entrances, etc.). Then again, this film is from 2001, so my perception of that might be just an indication that it's somewhat dated. Still very entertaining and well directed."
1136,0,"The ending is a bit predictable, but so is every movie. I'm more interested in the cast and the emotional roller coaster along the way, and this film certainly has that. Keanu Reeves is cast in a part that's a bit of a departure for him, as is Katie Holmes. This must have been before she got married to Tom Cruise and ended up in crazy town."
1137,0,"Billy Bob Thorton is the writer (lots of big names involved with this), and I read this story is based on the experiences of his mother who also reportedly had psychic abilities. I thought it was refreshing how Cate Blanchett is not overly sexualized in this film (wears tennis shoes except for in one party scene). She comes across as very nurturing, and it was a nice departure from most hollywood films."
1138,0,"I enjoyed it, it scared my wife though."
1139,0,"The only reason the movie was able to be action packed was because of the unbelievable and unrealistic stupidity and helplessness of the main character.  She is just constantly moronic, and I can't think of a single real life female who would display such a chronic case of brainlessness.  I found it shameful the way Cate's character was portrayed as being at the total mercy of men and unable to care for herself.  As horrible as this is, make no mistake, this is what carries the movie.  It's unfortunate that the degradation of women is used for entertainment.  But I think things have changed since 2000; women in movies since have demonstrated use of their brains."
1140,0,"It's hard to recognize Cate Blanchett.  She is completely lost within the character.  I loved her portrayal of a poor Southern woman.  The movie itself it quite brutal, and most of the violence is directed against women.  I have never been able to classify violence against women as entertainment, and I am very concerned about people who do.  For that reason, I wish I had never seen this movie.  However, I sat through it because of Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi  and the plot twists.  I do like the ending."
1141,0,"Everyone did a phenomenal job in this movie! The Southern accents were so believable! Australian-born Cate Blanchett was super convincing as a Southern fortune teller, and Keanu Reeves' character was very compelling as well; rarely have I seen him play personas that have a vile nature but that's what I liked about his role in this film; it was something different to behold compared to other characters he's played. I have to say, though, I was hoping to actually see ""Donnie"" get released from jail and possibly even become friends with ""Annie."" (Wishful thinking, I know, but I believe that would have added a nice touch of fulfillment to the movie). Ultimately, it ended on a good note, thankfully."
1142,0,"I bought this film so that I could watch it over and over It's one of Blanchett's earlier and less known movies, but it's powerful. Some places put it in the horror category, but I would say it's more in the suspense genre. It combines the paranormal with a murder mystery and strikes all of the right tones. Blanchett heads an amazing cast with Hilary Swank, Keanu Reaves, J.K. Simmons, Greg Kinnear and Giovanni Ribisi. Movies don't usually feature that many Academy Award winners and nominees for awards. Blanchett creates a very appealing character in Annie, a mystical woman who is trying to take care of her three sons after her husband is killed. Ribisi is nothing short of amazing in the way he portrays ""Buddy,"" the town mechanic with a deep and dark past that even Annie can't penetrate when she is distracted by a murder that rocks the community. Very engaging and entertaining to watch."
1143,0,"Intense drama.  Excellent characters performed by each star.  I would give it 5 stars but I was uneasy throughout much of it due to Keanu's role, and I am a sensitive soul.  Just me.  The movie accomplished exactly what it was designed to do."
1144,0,Very Heavy stuff.  Hard one to grade.  The acting is top notch and movie is powerful and compelling but exceedingly difficult to watch/witness as it focuses on the ugliness people can inflict on each; particularly actions inflicted upon women and children related to family violence. My wife had to quit watching it.  I would never watch it again but I give the producers credit for making a movie about situations that unfortunately are all too real in many families. Cate Blanchett is terrific...she is a gift to the movie
1145,0,"This is a well acted movie with excellent plot twists. The cast is fantastic and so believable as a small-town South community. I thought Hillary Swank was spot-on with her interpretation of her character. Plus, it was great to see Keanu Reeves play the bad guy since he hardly ever does. He's good at it, and should take more villain roles. They both got the husband/wife domestic violence vicious circle just right. High praise for this thriller! Buy it, hands-down."
1146,0,"A movie for adults possessing a modicum of intelligence and a mature attention span. This film came out in 2000, and is definitely not to be confused with a different movie of the same name released in 2015."
1147,0,"This psychological thriller showcases the early acting chops of the wonderful Cate Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank and a menacing Keanu Reeves, with fine support from Gary Cole, J.K. Simmons and Kim Dickens."
1148,0,"It has a few riveting scenes straight out of a horror flick, but strives for and achieves so much more."
1149,0,"This is a masterful approach to the primary themes and characters of the greatest of all Chinese novels. THE STORY OF THE STONE runs five (thick) volumes in length, has literally hundreds of characters, takes place in a very specific historical era, and mirrors both the religious and social practices of the time and also the broader political landscape in which the story takes place. I managed to love it the first time I read it even though I knew almost nothing about any of that, but successive readings have given me hundreds of questions, and this book has helped me find many answers. I'm not a scholar, so what matters to me is that this book, tough sledding though it can be at times, actually increases my enjoyment of one of my three or four favorite novels."
1150,0,The editors made an inspired decision to aim this volume at both teachers and researchers. The result is a veritable treasure-trove of pedagogical insights and scholarship.
1151,0,I bought this for a friend after reading my copy of the 1975 (I think) edition with the pages turning yellow. It's like medicine. Everyone who struggles with the idea that God is a God of love should read this. Excellent Biblical perspective on how God's love can be known even in the painful experiences of life. Why God's love isn't obvious on the basis of casual observation. Impossible to understand without faith in Jesus Christ.
1152,0,"I feel like this is a preacher who is preaching the deep, meat of the Lord's heart.....Oswald Chambers is my favorite!  Every paragraph has a compelling and truthful thought."
1153,0,Oswald Chambers teachings are always challenging but the challenge is always good to bring us back to the word of God.
1154,0,Fabulous book. I've read it three times and keep reading it. Oswald Chambers was really a wonderful godly man. Very deep
1155,0,Oswald chambers has taught me a depth of the he bible that has been astoundingly beautiful. He is the one person including his precious wife that I can't wait tp see I'm heaven. His love of Christ and his devotion to our Lord is sweet fragrance of heaven!
1156,0,As usual Oswald makes you think!!
1157,0,Anything O Chambers writes is dynamite
1158,0,Great amounts of wisdom in this book. Oswald never disappoints with his writing. Definitely worth a read and definitely a book I will read multiple times throughout life!
1159,0,"Awesome book, and anything Oswald Chambers writes is annointed by the Holy Spirit. You will see a man dying to flesh to write HIS heart out."
1160,0,I love anything by Oswald Chambers and it makes an excellent gift for anyone that needs an insight to the word of God.
1161,0,"This book has it all! I am a masters student at Columbia University studying Neuroscience and Education. My thesis is on the neuroscience of mindfulness and I have read over 20 books touting mindfulness research in an educational setting - So many of them are for beginners seem to be written for an ideal classroom that does not exist (did I mention that I'm an 8th grade Special Education teacher in Brooklyn?) This book is full of the newest research and applications for the classroom. It hits on interdisciplinary levels, such as social emotional learning, and the fixed/growth mindset. This book would be great to give anyone you know who has developed learned helplessness or chronic stress over time - regardless of whether they are an educator or student. Aside from this book, I also recommend Daniel Rechtschaffen's book, The Way of Mindful Education, which has great lesson plans for students of all ages (and all demographics) in the classroom."
1162,0,"Mindfulness is the capacity to achieve nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment, without grasping or aversion. (Boddhi, 1999).  Research has revealed that there are specific identifiable components of mindfulness meditation: attention regulation; body awareness; emotion regulation; and change in perspective on the self.  (Holzel, et al., 2011, p. 539)"
1163,0,"There is currently a great renewal of interest in promoting Social Emotional Learning (“SEL”) in our schools, together with recognition that mindfulness based approaches could form an important component of approaches geared towards development of social-emotional skills.  Research shows that we have a greater need than ever for schools to address the nonacademic needs of students, as statistically significant minorities of school aged children have statistically significant emotional/behavioral vulnerabilities and lack of academic readiness.  (Jennings P., Lantieri, L, & Roeser, R., 2012, p. 372).  There are two main avenues through which this can be accomplished:  (1) creating a curriculum that promotes mindfulness (and SEL) through inquiry-based, collaborative, experiential learning (as already done in certain private schools, e.g., Montessori and Reggio Emilia); and (2) instructing teachers and students in the regular use of mindfulness based practices, preferably as part of an organization-wide or state-wide SEL program."
1164,0,"Against this backdrop, a number of books have been published in recent years, exploring ways in which mindfulness can be used to support the work of education in the social-emotional arena.  One such book is Mindful Learning, written by two professors at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, Drs. Craig Hassed and Richard Chambers.  This book would be an excellent first read for educators who would like to learn about the science behind, and benefits of, mindfulness practices.  The book is scaffolded in a way that allows for clear understanding of the potential positive relationship between mindfulness and the mental qualities necessary for efficient learning.  The reach of the book is broad, ranging from the science supporting the use of mindfulness based interventions, to the mental skill sets needed for effective learning, to actual practices that educators may use to develop a mindfulness practice."
1165,0,"Unsurprisingly, given the secular focus of the book, the authors focus on four cognitive aspects of mindfulness: Perception; Nonattachment (letting go); Acceptance; and Present moment (awareness). (Id., pp. 12-17):"
1166,0,"• Perception:  lack of perception involves believing the stories our brains tell us, having a narrow viewpoint or a fixed mindset;  with mindfulness we may begin perceiving what we project onto situations, for example, bringing us to a different perspective, seeing the bigger picture or seeing things from a different angle."
1167,0,"• Nonattachment: involves letting go of or releasing thoughts, feelings, ideas; neither grasping onto or pushing away from (aversion)."
1168,0,"• Acceptance:  after noticing or acknowledging what is (perception) and being neutral towards it (non-attachment), can we accept or allow things to be as they are? The authors offer a caveat: “(u)sing acceptance to make something go away is actually nonacceptance masquerading as acceptance…”  What is helpful here is remembering the impermanence of all things, that this too shall pass. Also, we should refrain from “shooting the second arrow”, that is, letting go of any judgment of the thought, idea, feeling, or sensation as “bad” or “wrong”.  Although this may sound, it is not easy – because sometimes what arises is difficult or painful or even intolerable.  (Id., p. 16)."
1169,0,"• Present Moment: “The present moment is the only moment that has any legitimate claim to reality.  The past and future are just ideas.  The past and future never actually exist…” (Id., p. 17)."
1170,0,"At the beginning of Mindful Learning, the authors discuss the need for a pedagogical shift to an inquiry based approach to education, i.e., the dialectic approach, as opposed to the traditional public school approach where the teachers are providing knowledge and the student absorbs it (without much reflection or personal connection).  There is recognition of the importance that students maintain a childlike fascination with the subject matter.  The question is posed, how do we keep children interested, and not destroy their naturally inquisitive spirit, ending up like a “snuffed out candle”? (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 3, quoting Einstein)."
1171,0," “Einstein felt that real discovery was an intuitive process.  Intuition…comes from the Latin word intueri, meaning “to look upon, consider, contemplate.”  It is not “an unconscious, unreflecting, conditioned, or automatic way of seeing things.  It is all about being conscious and aware.  If we really look we have a chance of understanding, because what is within us is connecting with what we are observing.  Thus connectedness, or unity, goes hand in hand with learning mindfully.”  (Ibid.)."
1172,0,"After this beginning, there is very little in the book that discusses changing the pedagogy of schools; rather the primary focus is on educating teachers so that they may be mindful models of educational leadership in the classroom.  Developing mindfulness in teachers is viewed as an issue of primary importance  by the authors: “Education (on mindfulness) needs to take place at a number of levels, starting with the training of quality mindfulness teachers.” (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 179).  Thus, Mindful Learning focuses to a large extent on bringing mindfulness into the classroom through teachers who have developed their own mindfulness practices, as well as through scripted mindfulness exercises to be practiced with students, which may be found in Chapter 20."
1173,0,"Much of the book is devoted to presenting evidence of why engaging in mindfulness is a beneficial practice for teachers and students.  However,  they do recognize the indispensable truth that “(m)indfulness can only be offered; the choice is always the person’s own as to whether they will take up the gift.” (Id., p. 145).  “Mindfulness cannot be imposed on students.  They will need a level of motivation and insight in order to engage with the process.  Otherwise they will just pretend to go through the motions to keep the teacher happy, or – even worse – they will build up resistance and resentment to mindfulness, an attitude that might be difficult to shift.” (p. 144)."
1174,0,"The authors call for a type of “applied mindfulness” which departs from traditional mindfulness practice by its results driven focus of attaining specific goals, such as stress reduction and performance enhancement.  In contrast, mindfulness as developed from ancient Buddhist philosophy has at its core the purpose of achieving enduring happiness and gaining insight into the true nature of existence (impermanent, unreliable, and non-self). (Boddhi, 1999).  The authors state that, instead of teaching mindfulness and “letting students figure out on their own how to apply it,” they teach mindfulness with the stated goals of managing stress, improving study performance (by learning to sustain attention and focus over a period of time), developing presence of mind rather than trying to multitask , and overcoming procrastination. (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 48)."
1175,0,"The definition of mindfulness in Mindful Learning is a “mental discipline aimed at training attention” (Id., p. 6).  In this reader’s opinion, this definition omits the true purpose of mindfulness as a path for transformation, that involves development of wisdom, intuition and discernment, liberation from suffering, and inner growth of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (the brahmaviharas). The concern here is that mindfulness could end up becoming a tool to enable students to be calm and compliant with a dull curriculum, rather than following a path paved with curiosity and kindness, with an aim of inner transformation."
1176,0,"Drs. Hassed and Chambers believe that applied mindfulness is justified by the results:  that hooking students and teachers into trying mindfulness (as a secular practice that enhances performance and reduces stress) will allow them to experience mindfulness.  The viewpoint is that once people begin practicing mindfulness, they will understand on an experiential level the benefits of such a practice, and then begin to apply it more broadly in their lives, that is, generalize mindfulness to other areas of their lives.  The concept of “applied mindfulness” will likely appeal to many within the public education system, with its focus on measurable results in attainment of educational skills.  However, this view of mindfulness arguably omits the heart of mindfulness:  which is to wake up to whatever is, in the present moment, and to allow what is there to just be, with loving-kindness and gentle curiosity.  A question that arises is, if the practice of “applied mindfulness” is results-driven and goal-oriented, is it still mindfulness?"
1177,0,"However, it is understood that our public education system is mandated, to the extent possible, to use secular methodologies shown to be effective by scientific research which will enable students to make measurable progress in skill acquisition.  Perhaps what we need are some additional goals in education, which incorporate skills which are not so measurable, such as kindness, empathy, and joy in learning?  Our society is so results driven, can we allow space for these priceless capacities to arise?"
1178,0,"Putting aside the issue of “applied mindfulness,” there are many positive aspects to this book.  For instance, the discussion of mindfulness and attention in the early part of the book is spot on.  The authors discuss how we are often not even aware of where our attention is, and that noticing what our attention is focused upon is the first step in developing mindfulness.  “Mindfulness is not a distraction from our worries.”  (Hassed & Chambers, 2015, p. 9).  “Mindfulness meditation is…not a method of tuning out but rather of tuning in…..” (Id., p. 11).  “We cannot stop the mind from thinking” . . . . . but we can “learn to be less reactive to it or involved in it.” (Id., p. 10)."
1179,0,"One of the main thrusts of this book is the positive impact of mindfulness upon executive functioning skills, which are high level functions of the brain’s prefrontal cortex important for learning.  “Research shows that practicing mindfulness activates many of the same brain areas as those that are active when we are engaged in executive functioning…….particularly attention, short-term memory, regulating emotional impulses, planning, and mental flexibility.”  (Id., p. 24).  Strengthening these capacities is one of the primary purposes for the use of “applied mindfulness” according to the authors."
1180,0,"One of the ways in which the authors explain the benefits of mindfulness is by exploring the “costs” of mindlessness, including the following:"
1181,0,• Wasting Time
1182,0,• Not Understanding Things
1183,0,• Mental Roadblocks
1184,0,• Poor Emotional Well-Being
1185,0,• Not Enjoying Life
1186,0,• Can’t Sleep
1187,0,• Communicating Poorly
1188,0,• More Distractible
1189,0,• Lack of Motivation
1190,0,• Poor Memory
1191,0,"• Effects on the Brain (Id., pp. 40-45)."
1192,0,"We are reminded of an important lesson from neuroscience: that whatever we practice becomes the habit of the mind.  “(W)e give power to whatever our attention is directed to.”  (Id., p. 11).  As  Dr. Dan Siegel often says, “neurons that fire together, wire together”.  Thus, the more we practice “unmindfulness”, the more we will reap the “costs” listed above.  Research has shown that mindfulness can “ literally shape our brain in ways that make it much easier to concentrate, remember and learn, regulate emotions and behaviors, reason and think abstractly.” (Id., p. 32)."
1193,0,"In furtherance of cultivating mindfulness within the teaching environment, the authors suggest creating a mindful physical environment, regular practices of self-care, and a teaching style that is calm and enthusiastic, encouraging openness, and which uses mindfulness practices in the classroom.  The authors do recognize the importance of teaching mindfulness not as “a separate skill divorced from other aspects of the curriculum” but rather as something that is “integrated with other content.” (Id., p. 141).  There appears to be an assumption that teachers will intuitively know how to do such things as a result of their own mindfulness practices, as the authors do not deeply delve into how these things might be accomplished as a practical matter."
1194,0,"However, this may be because one of the key points made by the authors is the importance of learning from failure.  They state that “(a) mindful response to failure is:"
1195,0,"• To be able to sit with, and be open to, the discomfort."
1196,0,"• To acknowledge the failure, turn the attention to it rather than avoid it, learn from it, and then move on."
1197,0,• To take a bigger view of life with its ups and downs (this too will pass).
1198,0,• Not to measure our self-worth by one apparent success or failure in one particular episode of life.”  (p. 89).
1199,0,"So if teachers are mindful of failure, they will in fact be integrating mindfulness into the curriculum, by learning from their own experiences.."
1200,0,"A large part of this book is devoted to motivating teachers and parents to develop a regular practice of mindfulness, as well as to be self-aware of:"
1201,0,"• teaching style (including whether process or product oriented; and fixed or growth mindset),"
1202,0,"• levels of stress,"
1203,0,"• levels of emotional well-being and enjoyment of life,"
1204,0,"•  personal bias,"
1205,0,"•  level of mental flexibility,"
1206,0,"• problem solving skills,"
1207,0,"• level of resilience,"
1208,0,"• work practices (procrastination, disorganization, lack of perspective, multitasking, unrealistic expectations vs. hopeful aspirations), and"
1209,0,• complacency.
1210,0," The authors believe that if mindfulness practices are adopted first by adults, this will result in mindful teaching methods, as a result of changing expectations into aspirations, changing mindsets, learning to learn from failure, and working with emotions mindfully.  Thankfully, the authors do fully recognize that such change does not happen overnight. (Id., p. 167)."
1211,0,Conclusion:
1212,0,"Mindful Learning covers a large range of territory, and has sufficient depth for an educator’s first introduction to Mindfulness.  The book is carefully written to avoid any religious, philosophical, or spiritual overtones, which might cause discomfort in the educational setting. The focus on the brain-based (or cognitive) aspects of mindfulness (e.g., improving executive functioning skills such as attention and working memory) give the book a solid grounding in educational science.  The practices included in the back of the book are well scripted, and useful.  While the book does not discuss needed changes in state-wide or school district-wide pedagogy to bring mindfulness into the mainstream of education, it does address some of the challenges associated with organizational change."
1213,0,"One concern that arose is the potential effect of divorcing of mindfulness from grounding in ethics (such as the Noble Eightfold Path), loving-kindness, ethical/moral values, or spiritual principles.  This book contains William James’ oft-quoted statement on “the importance of being able to focus attention as the ultimate education.” (Id., p. 5).  However, mindfulness is not just about the focusing of attention, but also about the attitude that we cultivate towards what we pay attention to, and how we act in response to what arises."
1214,0," While this book has omitted what many consider to be the true purposes of mindfulness: a path for transformation, liberation from suffering, wisdom, development of kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity (the brahmaviharas), that may well have been intentional, in order to make delivery of the message of mindfulness more palatable to those within the educational system."
1215,0," It is encouraging that books such as Mindful Learning have arrived on the educational scene, which are helping to breathe new life into the movement to bring mindfulness-based approaches, which are consistent with social-emotional learning principles, into the realm of public education."

1258,0,"It had been only a few days since the end of the school year.  I stared down at the book titled Mindful Learning, written by Dr. Craig Hassed and Dr. Richard Chambers, mindfulness consultants at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  The cover, which looks like a chalkboard, triggered a flood of memories from the classroom.  Was I ready to read my first full-fledged mindfulness in education book for the summer?"
1259,0,"After a week or two of mindful waiting, I started reading, not knowing exactly what to expect.  I had chosen to read this book because it has been marketed toward people who work with high-school age children and above.  Other related books - “The Way of Mindful Education”, “Teach, Breathe, Learn”, and “Mindfulness for Teachers” – I read while teaching middle school.  Now that I had moved onto teaching older students, it seemed appropriate to explore a resource targeting this age group."
1260,0,"True to the Aussie way of being, Hassed and Chambers adopt a casual tone, even when delving into complex topics such as neuroscience.  Throughout the book, they use the pronouns “we” and “us”, referring to the wider community as well as to themselves.  They also use brevity to their benefit, using the least possible words that still relay their thoughts. But blink and you might miss a transition, giving a feeling of abrupt turns.  Look closely and you’ll see how carefully they organized their book.  They begin by defining education and mindfulness before moving on to exploring mindfulness in student learning, which is the text’s main focus.  They then discuss mindfulness in creativity, sports, and relationships.  Later, the authors apply mindfulness to teachers, even laying out ways to work with those resistant to incorporating these practices into the classroom.  They follow by describing how mindfulness goes well beyond school walls.  For concluding thoughts, they briefly mention potential approaches that organizations can implement when incorporating mindfulness, along with common snafus they may face.  For takeaway tools, they include twelve sample exercises for teachers to try in or out of the classroom."
1261,0,"Instead of beginning with a definition of mindfulness, Hassed and Chambers first invite us to pause by asking the question, “What is education?”  It has taken me years to fully arrive at their view of education as a holistic endeavor where teachers and students can learn from any situation – an endeavor where teachers facilitate or elicit existing insight through inquiry and questioning.  Mindfulness supports this perspective.  I read about this holistic approach while in graduate school for teaching and learning, but I didn’t understand or embody it until I went so fully away from this view and back again after almost leaving the profession entirely.  Why is it that so many teachers lose sight of teaching as drawing out from within?  I still grapple with this question, trying to balance my own views with the existing structures in the public school district where I teach.  From this searching perspective, I fully appreciated the authors’ note - “The journey to becoming a mindful teacher and learner is a lifelong project” (2014, p.4)."
1262,0,"In our fast-paced world, mindfulness can appear counter-intuitive.  Instead of pausing to navel gaze, shouldn’t we be doing more to get ahead?  Hassed and Chambers efficiently and thoroughly address the misconception that mindfulness meditation is about stopping and clearing one’s thoughts.  They explain how it is more of a process of awareness and release from the grips of thinking, giving away our attachments to our thoughts.  They don’t contribute anything new to the existing foundational knowledge of mindfulness.  Rather, they organize information into a secular, digest-able fashion, using vignettes from the school setting.  Then, to boost our confidence and conviction about the importance of mindfulness in a world of skepticism, they ground us in the dominant language of science.  Explaining clearly how mindfulness practices can shape our brains to improve concentration, memorization, emotional regulation, reasoning, and abstract thinking, they convince even a skeptic to explore the potential of mindfulness to enhance (and even transform) our educational, recreational, and personal lives."
1263,0,"Hassed and Chambers’ find a niche in their attention to the effects of mindfulness on stress, focus, and performance in older students.  Like many others, I used to think that we need a certain bit of stress in order to perform better.  However, the authors illustrate how we can perform from a mindful state of calm and confidence, free from stress.  It’s worth looking up the Hassed mindfulness-based stress-performance graph to rethink your view on stress.  They convinced me that mindfulness is a valuable skill, mindset, and way of being that helps us reduce stress and enhance attention.  If you aren’t convinced by their graph, read their chapter on why attention matters – the costs of unmindfulness.  Wasting time, not understanding things, poor emotional well-being, and not enjoying life are just some of the outcomes of living in the dark."
1264,0,"What struck me about Hassed and Chambers is how intentional they are with their use of mindfulness in education.  Instead of leaving the effects of mindfulness on student learning up to chance, they have specifically created a program, Mindfulness for Academic Success (MAS), to apply mindfulness to studying.  This program came out of their personal realizations that people more easily comprehend mindfulness when the focus is more explicit.  They share a few exercises to give us a taste of MAS.  I tried out their study meditation where students work on a written task while noting any mental distractions on one side of the paper.  Experientially, I understood their intention of helping students fully acknowledge and accept distractions in order to fully let go of them.  This was my first encounter with a program focused so directly on academic behavior – I wish I had enrolled in this program as an overwhelmed undergraduate."
1265,0,"Their chapters on resilience, emotional development, and communication sometimes read like a self-help book, providing tips and explanations on how to practice mindfulness to promote these skills.  Although this tone can be perceived as superficial, it can also be construed as actually helpful in providing us with a broader view of what mindfulness can do for our students.  Hassed and Chambers even take the time to address creativity, movement, and relationships since school is not always just about academics; arts, athletics, and social events play a large part in many communities.  In addition, I found their chapter on eMindfulness – how paying attention helps us use media more wisely – timely and highly applicable for our ultra-connected young adults."
1266,0,"I particularly enjoyed their roadmap for building mindfulness practices in children throughout the years, so that they do not fall into “mindfulness fatigue”.  Hassed and Chambers begin with Elementary School – Years 1-3: “simple mindfulness exercises to provide some quiet at the start and end of class” and end with College or University: “Teach how mindfulness applies to leadership, professional development, higher executive functioning, and self-care” (2014, p.142-143).  It is powerful to envision what mindfulness can look like if woven into long-term educational planning.  Of course, this roadmap is only an example of what can happen, as educators very well know the intricate complexities of planning and implementing curricula in large educational systems."
1267,0,"Lest you think Hassed and Chambers focus only on students, fear not.  They thoughtfully round out their mindfulness tour with a focus on the teacher.  As someone who has experienced almost all of the major barriers to teaching – burnout, stress, poor mental health, to name a few – it was cathartic to have someone put these difficulties into words and how mindfulness can help us to work through or around these so-called barriers."
1268,0,"Just when you get the sense that something might be missing from their whole tour, Hassed and Chambers admit that the attention training aspect of mindfulness can seem a little cold by itself.  They broaden mindfulness beyond the classroom by noting how mindfulness can be equally thought of as heartfulness.  They write, “The word mindfulness implies ‘mind’ – which many people equate to the brain – and so risks obscuring what is most important about learning to be more awake, open, and loving in each moment of life” (2014, p. 162).  As I arrived at the end of the book, I sensed some warm and fuzzies, fully opening to the potential of mindfulness to transform our way of being in the world."
1269,0,"Overall, I am filled with gratitude toward Hassed and Chambers for providing teachers, administrators, and parents with some clarity in our lifelong journeys to becoming mindful people and role models for our children.  I envision Mindful Learning as a useful resource for a school district or university interested in implementing mindfulness.  The text probably will appeal more-so to teachers of older students who are expected to study independently and become more aware of their learning habits, but the principles apply to every age level.  For a school district, it would be a great way for teachers to become more well-versed in what mindfulness actually is and how it can help.  The chapters can be used as stand-alone resources over a longer period of time, leaving plenty of room for discussion and dialogue.  After all, it is up to individuals and small groups to decide what to do with this valuable information."
1270,0,"Keep in mind as you continue your exploration of mindfulness in education that there is a multitude of resources to drawn from.  To learn more about the unmindfulness, or mindlessness, check out Ellen Langer’s ""Mindfulness"" (1990).  Interested in the neurobiology of mindfulness?  Read Willoughby Britton and Arielle Sydnor’s “Neurobiological models of meditation practices: Implications for application with youth” (2015) in Chris Willard and Amy Saltzman’s “Teaching Mindfulness Skills to Kids and Teens”.  Amishi Jha also delves into the science behind mindfulness in her talk, “Improving Attention and Working Memory” (2012), which can be found on Vimeo.  Searching for more guided mindfulness meditation practice?  Try the Headspace app, which leads you through a 30-day foundational practice before opening up to different themes such as health, relationships, or performance.

1271,0,"There is so much fascinating information in here about how the brain works, plus how we can best help our students learn.  I highly recommend it!"
1272,0,"Clear, concise, well-supported. Very helpful to anyone hoping to gain an overview of well-documented aspects of mindfulness and the brain!"
1273,0,"Dry book. Interesting material, but it's a chore to read. This may be because I had to read it for a class. Take it with a grain of salt."
1274,0,Excellent book on Mindfulness .. well written with lots of good ideas //recommended
1275,0,Excellent
1276,0,"This book provides the reader with an A - Z understanding of mindful learning.  What became clear to me in reading this book is that mindful learning is not just for the classroom, but for the curriculum of life. If you value learning this book if for you.  Well written, well researched and practical."
1277,0,"This book is made for me. I lived many years as absent mind person, now this book is helping to overcome that and I am enjoying my life."
1278,0,"I purchased this for my brother as a Christmas gift. Like me, he is a book collector, and has been wanting the first volume of this title, ""A Dream of Red Mansions"" for some time now (he already has Volumes 2 and 3). I purchased this book through a third party vendor here on Amazon and the book arrived intact and in excellent, almost new condition. It is a hardcover, printed in China, and is the first edition. The book contains some beautiful color illustrations depicting important scenes from the book. A classic of Chinese literature, this is a story that will appeal to readers keen to explore the diversity in world literature."
1279,0,"This is one of the most interesting and profound novels I have read, a masterpiece of Chinese literature and a world class contribution. I genuinely enjoyed this translation of this 250-year old novel. The text flowed well and was clear and understandable.  The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature. The descriptions and characterization are so realistic you feel as if you have known those people and places for years. I would say this is a must-read!"
1280,0,"I am studying Chinese and but my reading is not good enough to be able to read the original of this famous classic novel.  What I really liked about this edition was having Chinese and English face to face, which helps me practice reading my Chinese.  The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.  The 6 volumes are thick and heavy, and we are treated to a full page illustration in the style of Chinese painting every other chapter.  That's about 60 paintings."
1281,0,"The reason I give it a star less is the prevalence of typos.  You're likely to encounter one every page or every few pages.  Most were obvious and easy to correct, but it was rather annoying.  A little more quality control in the typesetting would have helped."
1282,0,"It will take a while to finish, but I love the book so far!"
1283,0,"Present Chinese culture rests on seven pillars. One of these is the sayings of Kung Fu Tse, the others are found embodied in the ""Four Classics"", of which this is one. An easy read, an easy interpretation. Highly recommend for any traveler, and those who want to understand our Oriental Neighbor."
1284,0,I read this book second of the 4 classics (or 5 depending on who you speak to)
1285,0,"It was like watching a long, slow soap opera. The descriptions of food, clothing, and gifts were amazing."
1286,0,Just the long chapters discussing house politics and Baoyu's aloofness made me force myself to finish.
1287,0,"The ending was really good, and somewhat unexpected."
1288,0,"Romanization schemes for Chinese are notoriously imperfect, if for no other reasons than that 4 tones -- 5 if you count a null tone sometimes used -- are not immediately obvious to those who do not have a speaking knowledge of any of the Chinese dialects."
1289,0,"Perhaps I am prejudiced, having learned Chinese primarily using texts that happened to (mostly) rely on the Pinyin system.  However, it seems to me that Pinyin has the distinct merit of adhering most closely to the principles of most of the primary European languages (especially Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages) where vowel sounds are far more regular and predictable than they are in English, particularly."
1290,0,"I can't comment (yet) on this particular translation, though I am working through several other bilingual editions that are part of the same Foreign Language Press publication project, and can give a few early impressions based on what I've read so far."
1291,0,"These translations are commendable in that they seek to provide a full translation of the works in question, thereby attempting to avoid some of the cultural ""hyperbole"" that has been attached to some of these works by translators approaching the texts from outside the context of Chinese culture.  As a native-born speaker of English, I did not begin studying Chinese until my late teens and will never have the complete understanding of the culture to argue persuasively over the finer points of these translations."
1292,0,"However, on the intuitive side, I do not a certain defensiveness at times and an effort to provide translations that are either culturally acceptable to present-day political realities in the Chinese mainland regions, or that may simply be dodging some of the tougher editorial calls to be made."
1293,0,"It is very clear, especially in some of the introductory matter that accompanies many texts in this series, that the final English version was approved by someone not a native speaker of idiomatic English.  In most cases, the evidence appears in simple errors of literal translation of phrases that make perfect idiomatic sense in Chinese, but, rendered with too much literal faithfulness, are puzzling to say the least when they are rendered in English."
1294,0,"I would agree with others who've commented that these texts are probably best for someone whose knowledge of Chinese is limited and is looking for an English ""crib sheet"" for entering into the Chinese originals (or in some cases, modern Chinese renditions of Classical Chinese texts, as in FLP's 2 volume translation of the works of Zhuangzi).  Note, however, that the FLP translation of Zhuangzi is (unless I'm mistaken) the most complete translation presently available in English, and this is true of many other texts in the FLP's publishing project)."
1295,0,"As a student of Chinese language, I really don't care much what romanization method is used.  They are all far from ideal.  What I care about is that someone is making these texts available in English, even if the translations are not always the most poetic -- where poetry is called for."
1296,0,"I love this story, I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back. The Original book is over 5000 pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the 1835 original unfinished work. Le's put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is 28 episodes each an hour and a half long"
1297,0,"I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the ""Redists"", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!"
1298,0,Not a good translation and hard to follow. I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.
1299,0,This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline.  It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him.  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful.  I think the story takes place in the 17th century.  I don't think it can be read in a hurry.  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book.
1300,0,Allow a year or so to enjoy it.  I return to it again and again.
1301,0,"This is a Chinese classic, which is nicely translated to English. It's an interesting story and provides a glimpse into aristocratic culture in 18th century China."
1302,0,"It's a little hard to read, with a staggering number of characters who are referred to by both their names and their informal familiar titles. I gave up trying to keep track of all the characters and decided to power through the book focusing on the main plot and the central characters. For the more patient reader, the book is nicely footnoted, explaining the meaning of the names and the familiar titles, so it is possible to follow the details if you have the patience."
1303,0,"Abridged from a multi-volume mid-18-Century novel, this lively retelling captures the essence and the details of life and love in a rich Chinese household. Multiple intrigues and myriad characters mix, some characters disappear, some plots remain unresolved. But there is no complete version, so this greatly shortened rendition is quite satisfactory."
1304,0,This is the greatest novel ever published in the Chinese language. A true classic. Perhaps at the same level as Shakespeare. This novel is so highly regarded that entire schools of thought and research have arisen around it.
1305,0,In China this is considered a literary classic. I read it because I do business with China and I was told it might make understand their culture better. It really didn't it might of lost something in translation but a good story.
1306,0,"Dream of the Red Chamber, written in the 18th century in China, is a book for people who have a particular interest in Chinese culture.  For those of thus who do, we are grateful to have it available.  But for a person just looking for a diverting read, not so much."
1307,0,"An interesting read, makes me wish I understood a bit more of the Chinese writing tradition. Would recommend to someone who is interested in great world literature."
1308,0,"Chinese version, sorta, of Peyton Place.  An amusing and educational (chinese culture) read.  Discovered this book on a list of texts required for a Chinese literature class."
1309,0,"If you don't read another Chinese novel, this one will complete your experience.  It is the quintissential story of family life in China."
1310,0,"I needed this book for my east asian civilization class and I was already dreading reading a required book. This book is actually really well written. It deals with chinese legends and myths mix in with fiction. The names in the story can be confusing (you will mix them up) for a Western reader like myself but the book reminds you every so often who everyone is. Please pick up this book, you won't be disappointed."
1311,0,a great descriptive story
1312,0,"I have been reading a great deal of Urban Fantasy, and I was very much up for a change of pace. This really hit the spot, as they say. I felt like the characters were cohesive, complex and shown to the reader from enough angles to make them feel alive and real. While they all spoke in the flowery speech considered polite, it was easy to tell their personalities from their particular speech habits. I am often cut-throat in my reviews about dialogue so it's refreshing to be able to compliment, not critique it in a review."
1313,0,"The best thing about this book was not the plot -- because this is a fairly old work the plot has many of the tropes we readers come to expect from this sort of work. They may seem cliched now because so many newer works have aped them. However, the descriptions are astounding -- detailed and precise yet not overlong or exhausting. It always maintains the perfect level to engross and trap the reader but not bore them. The 'movie' in my head was awash with wonderful detail, lush backgrounds and perfect costumes. I really haven't read description this good in a very long time."
1314,0,"However, the one thing I didn't care for was the three or four incidents of anachronism stew. Xifeng had a wrist watch centuries before they came into fashion, Baochai had a few too many modernisms in her speech and  the Chinese manners of gift-giving were ignored, possibly to make the work more appropriate for a western audience. If these had not stuck out of the narratives like sudden blotches of bright paint on a somber renaissance portrait, this would have been five stars. UPDATE -- the author has taken the time to address this paragraph in the comments. Please read her replies as they explain a great deal."
1315,0,"This is a translation....so there is usually some loss of understanding.  The book is massively long and the names of the characters are very confusing.  In the front of the book they give a geneology map...you've got to be kidding...no way to keep track....just keep on reading.  It does give a great description of the class system, the mores, and the discrimination that was present. However...I found it to be  an exhausting book to read  and I lost interest in the characters"
1316,0,One of the best books I've read about China during that time frame. I was able to relate to the different characters even though they were totally out of my frame of reference. I had sympathy for the various chactacters and the author
1317,0,Did a very credible job of explaining why they acted the way they did. I always like to think that when I am reading an
1318,0,"Historical novel I am learning much about the period, the place, the history, and how it affected those people that lived through it. I will not soon forget this wonderful novel. I am so glad that this author re-wrote this historical novel and made it simpler for the present readers. it must have been a difficult undertaking and I can see from Pauline Chen's impressive degrees that she truly was in a position to write such an intelligent book. Please write more!!!"
1319,0,I consider this story a fan fiction based on the original rather than a abridged version of the original considering the number of characters the author either kills off at the beginning or allowed to live till the end.
1320,0,The bad: It is written in present tense. Why did the author do this? It makes reading it more awkward. Four stars if it had not been written in present tense. Seems common for debut authors for some reason.
1321,0,"The good: It's an interesting, easy to read version of a very long plodding confusing classic. Her version of the ending is mostly believable (except the epilogue!) and the characters are well drawn if perhaps seemingly a bit different from the original."
1322,0,"Read this and then read the five volume version, you'll appreciated both more."
1323,0,I've been reading various versions and translations of  A Dream of Red Chambers since the mid 70's and approached this book with some trepidation. Well I enjoyed it so much I bought the audio book (which brought came with the extra bonus of learning the correct pronounciation of charactar's names) and have listened several times over which then leads to a re-reading of the original:-)
1324,0,BTW a set of unabridged audio books of ADoRC would be worth the expense...
1325,0,There were too many characters with names that I couldn't even pretend to sound out. The book was too long then just ended. I did not enjoy this book
1326,0,"suggest you read this book of you have an interest in China, it's customs and politics. The love stories may make this book appeal more to women."
1327,0,"I think this novel may have been received better had Chen creditted the Red Chamber rather than fashion this book as a retelling. The closed world of a family in standing within the classical world of its Emporors, feels like a peeping with Daiyu into a secret world.  I am intrigued with the linked lives of the women of this world and how they live out their lives often within a few rooms. Despite its failure to stand alone as ""The"" Red Chamber, Chen has brought us to a different way of seeing the world"
1328,0,"I have never read Dream of the Red Chamber but decided to pick up this novel as a condensed version of the aforementioned.  Pauline Chen's The Red Chamber is a captivating read from the get-go, especially in that it provides the right balance of historical context while not detracting from the depths of the main characters.  Some may be unhappy at the changes that have been made in this novel, but if it's taken as a separated, individual novel rather than a reworking of the classic, it will prove to be an enjoyable read.  I was caught up in the novel to the point that I was in tears by the end."
1329,0,"Descriptive, thought provoking, emotional. Very easy to read and I literally could not put the book down. The names of the characters took a little getting used to, but I soon got familiar with them. Highly recommend."
1330,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
1331,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
1332,0,This book is superb. I have read the Chinese version. Mr Hawkes' work is not only a translation but a gloss on the original text in modern language albeit in English.
1333,0,"This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing."
1334,0,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
1335,0,"I have now read all three volumes of the David Hawkes' translation of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' and I am simply blown away by the sheer volume of the text, and how there is never a dull moment. Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."
1336,0,Don't miss this series.
1337,0,Excellent edition with all three in new shape.
1338,0,Love the book and the series! It's a fascinating book and I highly suggest it. Can't wait to read it!
1339,0,'Thank the Lord for that!' said Bao-yu fervently. 'If only she could shake it off altogether!'
1340,0,Nightingale looked up at him with amusement:
1341,0,'It's not often we hear you calling on the Lord.'
1342,0,Bao-yu returned her smile:
1343,0,'Any doctor will do in an emergency.'
1344,0,"Man oh man, this is one bittersweet book, folks. It's the sunset of an era for the Jia family, and everyone and their dog knows it. Dai-yu, Bao-yu, Xi-feng, and nearly half of the characters are either sick or depressed. Anything not nailed down is being pawned off out the yinyang. Prospect Garden empties out its beautiful girls. Hell-- things are so bad, the servants can't even keep the damn gates locked at night. As Xi-feng bemoans when trying to bean-count the family's way out of bankruptcy, the Jias are slaves to their own past good fortunes and it's about time that the chickens come home to roost."
1345,0,"To be frank, it doesn't have the spellbinding whimsy of the The Golden Days, or the splendorous atmosphere of The Crab-Flower Club. What The Warning Voice does have, however, is a helluva mood. True to its spirit of Taoism, the characters are liberated by their own true natures, and entrapped by spider webs of their own design:"
1346,0,"In the first half, the girls of Prospect Garden explore their talents, their ambitions, and even their sexualities and genders. One girl pretends to be the wife of another girl until it feels real, while one of Bao-yu's servants begins to adopt a male persona. And both are treated with such wonder, sensitivity, and total lack of sensationalism that it sneaks up on you. But all it takes is some jealous and irrational busybodies, and next thing you know -- Bao-yu is wandering an empty garden."
1347,0,"I wanted to yell at this book for how it puts these people, who I feel like I've known since they were boys and girls, through terrible misery. At the center of the impending disasters is Dai-yu, because like a flower, she is blooming into something beautiful -- and also very, very, very, VERY not long for this world. Bao-yu, meanwhile, is shaping up to be quite a sensitive, smart, and caring man...just in time to wave goodbye to her."
1348,0,"The most bittersweet thing of it all is knowing there's two more volumes, and things must get worse before they get better. And it's bittersweet to move on without David Hawkes as the trusty translator, my companion through this foreign world (I sure hope the next volume explains why he stopped, because half the joy is cross-referencing his translation with the Chinese, and appreciating Hawkes's good sense and creativity). But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."
1349,0,"A must read from my favorite Trump trollbuster on the Twittersphere. From hilarious online antics, expert trollbustering tips, horse sense, religion, politics and more. Read it!"
1350,0,"comfy as sorghum over steamin' hot cornbread. Words for the soul. I don't think I'm alone in feeling like I woke one morning and my beloved country, flawed but kind, humane and striving for fairness and sufficiency, had turned into a moldering Confederate zombie. Except it hadn't just become that zombie--that rot, that evil, had been with us all along, and I guess I'd been choosing not to see. Tea Pain made the same journey many of us have. He's found clarity beyond the anger and the outrage. He's become one of the unique voices of our time. Through the clouds of religious jibberjabber, waves of fact-free soundbites and shrieking hoards fomenting treason while proclaiming patriotism, Tea's is a voice of clarity: It's wrong to hurt others. It's good to help others. Be nice on twitter. Or at least check your spelling. I've apparently been over complexifyin': There's right and there's wrong and it's past time to make a choice."
1351,0,"I, like Tea, was a Republican. I grew up in that area of Arkansas and, God willing, my wife and I will be able to afford a bit of land up in those mountains around Ponca and Jasper someday. We spend every opportunity we have on or near the Buffalo River. So Tea's words may have resonated a bit deeper with me--that river and those mountains are precious and worth fighting to save. So is the rest of the country. Tea's gift is to help keep us focused. To cut through the rivers of crap and manipulation. To remind us of our values. And remind us that we're not alone. He does it with humor and with humanity. Hypocrites get petarded while us good but somewhat flawed folks receive compassion. There's insight, illumination and world-class snark. It's a hell of a book."
1352,0,"If you like Mr. Tea, buy this book! And if you know nothing about him, buy it anyway!"
1353,0,"For those who know TeaPain from Twitter, you likely already love him. For those who don't know him, you will quickly learn to love his razor sharp repartee as he takes us on his journey from being a Tea Party Republican to the recovered Republican he is today. He offers his perspective on what's happened & continues to in today's screwed up political environment with such humor that you won't want to stop getting this education! It's definitely a must read for all political junkies! I'm looking forward to the sequel already! Thanks, Tea, for the much needed coming relief. You're the best!"
1354,0,"You don’t need to be a Twitter user to enjoy this book. TeaPain, using Tweets, aptly demonstrates how our human foibles & follies reveal themselves in Twitter world. He shows how some cantankerous Tweeters ""step in it"" (with a little encouragement, of course) & uses folksy witticisms & plainly spoken truths to describe his different Twitter encounters, good & bad."
1355,0,"He also provides well thought out, sound guidance (for newbies & seasoned Tweeters alike) on how to safely navigate the often shark-infested waters in Tweet World."
1356,0,"I laughed. I cried over tender stories. I learned more about myself & grasped a better  understanding of others with views different than my own. This book became my refuge from the stress&strife of daily life. It was like sitting down for a great conversation with a best friend. I found myself singing 🎵Let me call you Tweetheart🎵as I prepared to sit down with my tea (orange pekoe & Mr. Pain) to read. I was truly sad when I came to the end. I hope Mr. TeaPain will consider writing another book sharing his experiences & perspectives, continuing the journey he laid out for us. TeaPain, you are America's Tweetheart!"
1357,0,"If you enjoy his tweets, you'll love this book. It's especially interesting to learn how he came around to his views and political philosophy. He is an American treasure and his book is a hoot!"
1358,0,I am about halfway through the book and it is even better than I had hoped it would be. Can't wait for some quiet time this weekend to read the rest.  If you like TeaPain on Twitter you will love this book!
1359,0,"I stayed up late laughing so hard that even the dog left me looking for quieter quarters. Tea Pain fearlessly takes on God, Guns and Gays, along with the 1st and 2nd amendments and the Alt-Right, as he mows down the falsely self-professed ""Christian patriot"" haters on Twitter with his lethal wit. Most importantly, Tea Pain luvs us and speaks the truth with grace and love. Best political humor ever!"
1360,0,"Like many other Americans, I joined Twitter last year to weigh in on the presidential election. (OK, I admit it, I really joined to do what I could to promote Hillary and to resist the Russian-backed candidate!)"
1361,0,"In addition to deciding exactly WHAT I wanted to tweet, as a new user, one of the other important initial decisions I had to make was whom I wanted to “follow” on Twitter. Certainly, it was easy to select prominent elected officials who espoused and supported my own political philosophy and leanings. Then there were the various media folks and other “famous” people whose opinions I valued and respected. But who after that? So much cacophony, so many diverse viewpoints being expressed daily on Twitter. (Not to mention the legions of Russian trolls and bots!)"
1362,0,"One tweeter who consistently showed up on my timeline (information “feed,” for non-tweeters), and one who consistently attracted my attention and interest was Tea Pain. He almost always had something interesting, timely and insightful to say in his tweets. Plus, his tweets were always infused with good humor and wry wit. Needless to say, I soon became one of his growing number of followers."
1363,0,"Perhaps as the logical extent of his popularity on Twitter, Tea Pain recently published his new book, American Tweetheart. I ordered the Kindle edition of his book and just finished reading it. I wasn’t disappointed, and neither will you be, if you decide to order and read it!"
1364,0,"He uses the same basic approach in American Tweetheart that he uses daily in his tweets. The barbs and zingers at the pompous asses among us (and their hanger-on sheep followers) are well aimed and quite effective in exposing their absurdity and not-so-infrequent hypocrisy. As any Tea Pain follower would expect, the book is definitely funny, and often borders on the hilarious. We even learn a little something about WHO Tea Pain actually is, as a person, although I’m still not certain if he is completely leveling with us or merely, once again, pulling our chain. In truth, it really doesn’t matter. It’s a book well worth the read, particularly if you are one of the many Tea Pain followers."
1365,0,"Do yourself a favor, get off Twitter for a couple of hours and download (or order the paperback) and read American Tweetheart. You will certainly be glad you did!"
1366,0,"Even though I joined twitter over a year ago, I actually didn't start tweeting till early spring of 2017. The level of stress I was experiencing since the election was rising out of control. I turned to twitter to engage so I didn't feel quite so helpless in the face of such an unbelievable turn in our political landscape. One of the first twitterites (that's a word right?) I followed was TeaPain. His information was always enlightening, insightful and, more importantly, truthful. I was so happy to find he had written this book which I immediately purchased and I cannot recommend it enough no matter which side of the fence you're on and which fence you choose. Liberal, conservative, libertarian, whatever - you'll find some great wisdom within these pages with a great dose of humor to remind you there is, hopefully, a lighter side to all the crazy."
1367,0,"Don't buy this edition unless Dover fixes the print quality. Currently the printing of the edition is visibly, albeit subtly pixelated, like they printed with the wrong resolution. I exchanged with Amazon and the second copy was identically pixelated. I will be calling Dover about this."
1368,0,This book came in amazing condition! I was very pleased.
1369,0,This book is great. Nothing is pixelated. The other buyer must have gotten a defective copy.
1370,0,"As the SF Opera was featuring an adaptation, I decided to read the Kindle so-called ""abridged"" version of this classic. While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."
1371,0,"Be advised, due to type font it's 3 times as long as regular Kindle books of this size. It take's between 1 and 2 hours to read a chapter and there are 56 of them!"
1372,0,"Children's book rather than the authentic, adult version classic. Buyer be ware!"
1373,0,Bad translation. I have heard great things about this story but could not get past the poor translation.
1374,0,"Reminds me of Jane Austin. Interesting peak into Chinese society. Well Ming era anyway.The 2nd book maybe better, I hope."
1375,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
1376,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
1377,0,The Hawkes translation 
1378,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
1379,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
1380,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
1381,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
1382,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
1383,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
1384,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
1385,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
1386,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
1387,0,"I was a competitive swimmer as a kid, and now I've returned to the pool after more than 25 years to try to become a competitive masters swimmer."
1388,0,"The basics came back like riding a bicycle (except for the butterfly, which I couldn't remember how to do at all) but a lot has changed over the years, and my technique was clearly rusty."
1389,0,"I don't have a coach, doing it on my own, and this book has been a tremendous help... and I'm not even done with it!"
1390,0,"The tips on a proper catch, and their little listening trick to correct hand entry, took 2 full strokes off my pool length in freestyle, for example."
1391,0,"This week I used their 4 phase method for learning butterfly to teach myself the stroke, and did my first pool lengths in fly.  I'm looking forward to using their other tips to refine the stroke and start adding it into my regular workout."
1392,0,This is just a tremendous book.  Easy to read and follow.
1393,0,"I strongly recommend it for anyone starting out, or making the transition from fitness swimming to competition, or returning to the water after a long time away."
1394,0,Definitely worth many times the cover price.
1395,0,My swimming background.
1396,0,"I have been a swimmer all of my life. I swum competitively since the age of 12, began swimming Masters in 1978. I have been coaching masters in 1998. Like most masters coaches I always emphasized strokes and  seasonal conditioning periodizatuion meven though like most masters teams only about 1/3 of the swimmers compete. Even my swimmers who don't compete enjoy the variety. Also, we have growing number of triathletes most of whom were not from a competitive  swimming background."
1397,0,"Ahl off this to is to say that this the most useful information and tools one book that hi have found. If you want to coach masters or you are a swimmer wants to improve you own swimming or to help your coach, BUY THIS BOOK! If you are a triathlete who wants to learn to "" swIm like a swimmer"" buy the book, but also find a masters team with a coach who emphasizes stroke instruction over long sets without technical instruction./"
1398,0,Only had this book for a day and it's already given me so much information on anything I've had questions on. It goes straight into detail on every strokes and how to be properly prepared and what you should do before meets and what levels you feel comfortable with. I recommend for people like me who have a little late start in pursuing the swimming dream.
1399,0,"Some Parts May be lacking in detail, but this overall targets the fears and weaknesses of the newbie swimmer. It has definitely improved my view on technique in stroke, breathing, and the importance of psychological stability in water."
1400,0,"If you aren't that good at swimming, and you want to swim faster, stronger, and enjoy the water, then this book is for you"
1401,0,"This is a great book.  It has a lot of drills, which if followed, will enhance you swimming skills.  Jim Montgomery has a lot of information he is willing to share."
1402,0,the difference between this book and the other kindle books available on swimming technique is that it includes a section on open water swimming. I was surprised to see this. Usually that gets skipped in beginners books.
1403,0,Good reference book for Masters swimmers.  You can always pick up a tip or two.  This book has lots of them.
1404,0,"I was a swimmer my whole childhood, but dropped it when in highschool. Last year, I finally started swimming again. This book is an amazing tool for perfecting stroke technique and swimming mechanics. It also has some very interesting information on training, as well as cool drills and clear pictures."
1405,0,This book is an introductory book of what swimming is.
1406,0,Despite well written an not boring most of those that had some back ground in swimming will not find new things or methods.
1407,0,Although it is a good introduction for someone that wants to know a bit more about the world of swimming.
1408,0,I am adult learner and this book has proven so beneficial. VERY methodical and practical.
1409,0,"A must read from my favorite Trump trollbuster on the Twittersphere. From hilarious online antics, expert trollbustering tips, horse sense, religion, politics and more. Read it!"
1410,0,"comfy as sorghum over steamin' hot cornbread. Words for the soul.

1411,0,"I, like Tea, was a Republican. I grew up in that area of Arkansas and, God willing, my wife and I will be able to afford a bit of land up in those mountains around Ponca and Jasper someday. We spend every opportunity we have on or near the Buffalo River. So Tea's words may have resonated a bit deeper with me--that river and those mountains are precious and worth fighting to save. So is the rest of the country. Tea's gift is to help keep us focused. To cut through the rivers of crap and manipulation. To remind us of our values. And remind us that we're not alone. He does it with humor and with humanity. Hypocrites get petarded while us good but somewhat flawed folks receive compassion. There's insight, illumination and world-class snark. It's a hell of a book."
1412,0,"If you like Mr. Tea, buy this book! And if you know nothing about him, buy it anyway!"
1413,0,"For those who know TeaPain from Twitter, you likely already love him. For those who don't know him, you will quickly learn to love his razor sharp repartee as he takes us on his journey from being a Tea Party Republican to the recovered Republican he is today. He offers his perspective on what's happened & continues to in today's screwed up political environment with such humor that you won't want to stop getting this education! It's definitely a must read for all political junkies! I'm looking forward to the sequel already! Thanks, Tea, for the much needed coming relief. You're the best!"
1414,0,"You don’t need to be a Twitter user to enjoy this book. TeaPain, using Tweets, aptly demonstrates how our human foibles & follies reveal themselves in Twitter world. He shows how some cantankerous Tweeters ""step in it"" (with a little encouragement, of course) & uses folksy witticisms & plainly spoken truths to describe his different Twitter encounters, good & bad."
1415,0,"He also provides well thought out, sound guidance (for newbies & seasoned Tweeters alike) on how to safely navigate the often shark-infested waters in Tweet World."
1416,0,"I laughed. I cried over tender stories. I learned more about myself & grasped a better  understanding of others with views different than my own. This book became my refuge from the stress&strife of daily life. It was like sitting down for a great conversation with a best friend. I found myself singing 🎵Let me call you Tweetheart🎵as I prepared to sit down with my tea (orange pekoe & Mr. Pain) to read. I was truly sad when I came to the end. I hope Mr. TeaPain will consider writing another book sharing his experiences & perspectives, continuing the journey he laid out for us. TeaPain, you are America's Tweetheart!"
1417,0,"If you enjoy his tweets, you'll love this book. It's especially interesting to learn how he came around to his views and political philosophy. He is an American treasure and his book is a hoot!"
1418,0,I am about halfway through the book and it is even better than I had hoped it would be. Can't wait for some quiet time this weekend to read the rest.  If you like TeaPain on Twitter you will love this book!
1419,0,"I stayed up late laughing so hard that even the dog left me looking for quieter quarters. Tea Pain fearlessly takes on God, Guns and Gays, along with the 1st and 2nd amendments and the Alt-Right, as he mows down the falsely self-professed ""Christian patriot"" haters on Twitter with his lethal wit. Most importantly, Tea Pain luvs us and speaks the truth with grace and love. Best political humor ever!"
1420,0,"Like many other Americans, I joined Twitter last year to weigh in on the presidential election. (OK, I admit it, I really joined to do what I could to promote Hillary and to resist the Russian-backed candidate!)"
1421,0,"In addition to deciding exactly WHAT I wanted to tweet, as a new user, one of the other important initial decisions I had to make was whom I wanted to “follow” on Twitter. Certainly, it was easy to select prominent elected officials who espoused and supported my own political philosophy and leanings. Then there were the various media folks and other “famous” people whose opinions I valued and respected. But who after that? So much cacophony, so many diverse viewpoints being expressed daily on Twitter. (Not to mention the legions of Russian trolls and bots!)"
1422,0,"One tweeter who consistently showed up on my timeline (information “feed,” for non-tweeters), and one who consistently attracted my attention and interest was Tea Pain. He almost always had something interesting, timely and insightful to say in his tweets. Plus, his tweets were always infused with good humor and wry wit. Needless to say, I soon became one of his growing number of followers."
1423,0,"Perhaps as the logical extent of his popularity on Twitter, Tea Pain recently published his new book, American Tweetheart. I ordered the Kindle edition of his book and just finished reading it. I wasn’t disappointed, and neither will you be, if you decide to order and read it!"
1424,0,"He uses the same basic approach in American Tweetheart that he uses daily in his tweets. The barbs and zingers at the pompous asses among us (and their hanger-on sheep followers) are well aimed and quite effective in exposing their absurdity and not-so-infrequent hypocrisy. As any Tea Pain follower would expect, the book is definitely funny, and often borders on the hilarious. We even learn a little something about WHO Tea Pain actually is, as a person, although I’m still not certain if he is completely leveling with us or merely, once again, pulling our chain. In truth, it really doesn’t matter. It’s a book well worth the read, particularly if you are one of the many Tea Pain followers."
1425,0,"Do yourself a favor, get off Twitter for a couple of hours and download (or order the paperback) and read American Tweetheart. You will certainly be glad you did!"
1426,0,"Even though I joined twitter over a year ago, I actually didn't start tweeting till early spring of 2017. The level of stress I was experiencing since the election was rising out of control. I turned to twitter to engage so I didn't feel quite so helpless in the face of such an unbelievable turn in our political landscape. One of the first twitterites (that's a word right?) I followed was TeaPain. His information was always enlightening, insightful and, more importantly, truthful. I was so happy to find he had written this book which I immediately purchased and I cannot recommend it enough no matter which side of the fence you're on and which fence you choose. Liberal, conservative, libertarian, whatever - you'll find some great wisdom within these pages with a great dose of humor to remind you there is, hopefully, a lighter side to all the crazy."
