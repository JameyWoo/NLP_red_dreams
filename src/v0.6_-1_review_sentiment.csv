1,0,0.20909090909090908,"I don't know how someone read this and thought it would make a good series.  I'm glad they did, but don't expect the series to be like the books.  I read a lot, all types of genres, but I had to force myself to get through as much as I did.  The books and the series are so different I could not watch and read at the same time.  Just as a book, without comparing it to the series, it is filled with way too much unnecessary information.  There were far too many characters that didn't matter to warrant mentioning there name.  If I had to read what someone was wearing one more time, I was going to throw the book.  It needs to be cut by 70% to remove the waste."

Now that Sansa's traitor father is dead, Joffrey and his mother refuse to let her go home.  Sansa's sister, Arya is posing as an orphan boy and trying to get back to Winterfell.

There are 1000 characters, and you sometimes get a little lost on who belongs to you, but it doesn't distract from the story.  Even though he writes about a fictional world, he doesn't make up words just to make them up.  He makes those 1000 pages fly by."

5,0,0.3416666666666667,"I tried reading the first book a while ago, and honestly got lost with all of the characters. After watching the TV show, it was easier for me to keep them all straight in my head. This is coming from a life-long avid reader (I read almost every day and have a library of books under my belt). All that said, once you get your mind wrapped around the characters, the books are phenomenal. It's not an easy read, no - but it's well worth the effort. Even if you've seen the TV show, the books keep you enthralled in this fantasy world. Highly recommend!"
6,0,0.27314814814814814,"As with the first novel in this fabulous series ""A Clash of Kings"" features memorable characters interwoven into a richly complex story of kings and lords, soldiers and knights, ladies and princesses.  It is hard to overstate how engrossing this story is.  Many of the characters are quite literally unforgettable.  It all takes place in a world that never was, but which bears some resemblance to medieval Europe and Asia."

11,0,-0.1,"This books pick up from where the Game of Thrones left after the  throne was succeeded by the son of Robert Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon. Yet his succession to the Iron Throne is packed with controversies. This is the very same reason that prompted others to claim for the same throne."
12,0,0.11000000000000001,But what I find to be most frustrating was Stannis is claim to the throne is based on his legitimate succession as the eldest sibling of the former king but why the hell would his younger brother Renly made the same claim? Wouldn’t it be great if Stannis and Renly were on the same side against the Lannisters but that is how deep and complex the story and plots of the series that’s why I love it.
13,0,0.04999999999999999,I reccommend this to all the fans of the Game of Thrones series and those who are seeking books that has some element of political allegories in it. The same reason why I am reading the series aside from being fan of the popular TV series.

15,0,0.23000000000000004,"Wonderful second installment to llnent to the Song of Ice and Fire series. I enjoyed this book as much as the first, despite having watched the entire HBO series prior to reading any of the books. I'll repeat my comment in my review of the first book: JK Rowling got me hooked on reading as a child, and George R R Martin got me hooked back on reading as an adult."
16,0,-0.15,"I completed all five books of the series before reviewing.  I might give it 2.5 stars.  The series suffers from repetition.  The author literally reminds you of plot points that just occurred, all the time.  The characters regularly repeat the same mantras over and over.  So there is simply too much repetition.  It's tedious."
17,0,-0.0214285714285714,"The series as a whole also suffers because, at it's heart, it's a fantasy soap opera.  It's about plot.  It's not about characters, it's not about conflict (strange as that may seem in books that have ample violence).  It literally could go on forever.  And sometimes it seems that way.  The plot also suffers from too many characters with too much detail and story lines that really don't forward the narrative."
18,0,0.1551948051948052,"For example, Pretty Pig, a pet of no importance whatsoever, gets more press time than Rikon, Bran, and Cately Stark, all central characters. It's as if the author refuses to pick up story lines of important characters or else the story would conclude.  This trend will worsen as the books progress.  The books will devote chapter after chapter of newly introduced characters, back story and machinations that end with their deaths leaving the reader to surmise what the hell the point of all that ink was."

21,0,0.06380952380952382,"After I finished ""Game of Thrones,"" I immediately downloaded ""Clash of Kings"" and began reading, eager to continue the story that so fully captured my attention.  This series is highly addicting, and I'm incredibly late reviewing this because it's impossible to stop reading after finishing a book to compose a review.  Also, the second and third book sort of run together, which makes it difficult to review them separately.  This is the perfect follow up to the first book - carries the momentum from the events introduced there and sets up its own story.  It somehow manages to be darker and grittier than the first installment without stepping into the realm of being gratuitous .  In fact, it's probably one of the best second novels I've read. Spoilers follow."
22,0,0.0076923076923076945,"I usually give a brief summary of the novel's story in my review, but with ""Clash of Kings,"" a brief summary simply isn't possible since there's so much going on in the book and a lot of it ties deeply to the events from the first novel.  Instead, I'll supply a very brief overview.  With Robert Baratheon dead and the legitimacy of his children brought into question, the Iron Throne is up for grabs and Westeros is plunged into civil war as (at least) four different people claim the Throne as theirs.  Meanwhile, the Night's Watch in the North begins to investigate the people beyond the Wall, the Wildlings.  In the East, Daenerys Targaryen moves forward with her plan to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for herself.  Her following has dwindled after the death of her husband, but her three newborn dragons make her notorious.  Though she refuses to give them away to secure aid, Daenerys hopes she can use her dragons to her advantage to reclaim what, in her mind, rightfully belongs to her family."
23,0,0.2287719298245614,"Martin sure knows how to tell a riveting story.  I've read a fair bit of fantasy over the years and eventually had to take a break from the genre due to becoming bored with seeing the same clichés and tropes used over and over again.  As I read ""Clash of Kings,"" I found myself waiting to see the book fall into the same pattern of predictability that I've seen elsewhere.  The first book was great in being unique and unpredictable, but could Martin really maintain that high standard throughout a second book?  The joke's on me because he definitely can...and I've learned better than to doubt his originality.  There isn't much in the way of resolution in this book, but that's ok since there are several more books that follow it.  Instead, ""Clash of Kings"" serves to propel the ideas established in the first book.  We see how events from ""Game of Thrones"" have unfolded and developed into something bigger and more widespread, and what we see is fascinating.  It's also worth mentioning that there are a lot of big players in this war, but Martin manages to make all of them distinct.  None are just thrown in to be there and all of them are fleshed out.  This isn't a generic world filled with the normal trappings of the genre - Martin's Westeros is unique and fully realized.  Reading about the different factions alone would be compelling...combine it with an intriguing plot and you've got one Hell of a good read!"
24,0,-0.09083333333333334,"It should also be noted that Martin pulls no punches when describing his dark, gritty world.  If you're squeamish and prefer to read about characters that blush when thinking about kissing or battles that are over and done with relatively quickly and cleanly, this probably isn't your book.  The big theme in ""Clash of Kings"" is the huge, ongoing civil war that has erupted across the entirety of Westeros, and no detail is spared.  The full horrors of the battlefield - bones being crushed, flesh split, the gruesome results of someone being turned into a bloody pulp via being bludgeoned by a blunt object, soldiers being trampled by their own horses, pretty much any awful battle-related thing you can come up with - are portrayed in graphic detail.  These fights aren't glorious; they're long, agonizing, and brutal, and Martin writes them so well that you'll find yourself on the battlefield alongside the characters (for better or worse, in some cases).  He's done his research on the tools and tactics of the medieval period, and it definitely shows.  He also doesn't hesitate to show us the other not-so-pleasant aspects of humanity.  Sex (whether consensual or the spoils of war) is a common occurrence and it isn't portrayed in a nice, chaste manner.  Like many other things in the books, it's blunt, realistic, and often uncomfortable...both for the characters and the reader.  The people who populate Martin's world drink, curse, and entertain lewd, violent, or otherwise nasty thoughts.  Sanitation is what you'd expect it to be in a war torn, medieval country.  These things often aren't fun to read about, but they add a level of authenticity to the novel, and I personally find it refreshing to read an author who doesn't sugarcoat the realities of armed conflict.  The details characterize the world and the people in it - if you read ""Clash of Kings"" and think ""Wow, this person/event/place is awful!"" then you're probably thinking what Martin intended with this characterization.  Westeros is not a fun place to be, and Martin's attention to the dark, gritty, unpleasant details bring that into sharp focus."
25,0,0.07966666666666666," Much like with ""Game of Thrones,"" this book has several main characters with the point of view changing in each chapter.  This continues to work well by providing different viewpoints of big events without becoming repetitive and tiresome.  More importantly, it showcases Martin's talent for creating dynamic, three-dimensional, complex, fully realized characters.  I've read a lot of novels lately that have been in first person point of view, but have ultimately failed to capture the essence of the character or put the reader in the protagonist's head.  ""Clash of Kings,"" though written in third person, doesn't have this problem.  Each character's viewpoint is distinctly different with the characters' biases and backgrounds moving prominently to the forefront.  Even better, with the figures' biases colouring events, you'll often wonder whose version of events is the correct version or if any of them are truly accurate.  It makes of an interesting, unique reading experience, especially with the big events that unfold in this book."
26,0,0.10354497354497355,"It's also worth mentioning that although there are certain characters who are clearly protagonists and antagonists, whether or not you like them will be largely dependent on how you react to their characterization, not what their role in the story is.  Since starting ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" I've noticed that everyone seems to like and dislike different characters - and what one person may like about a certain character may cause another person to dislike them.  I think this demonstrates how realistic Martin has made his characterization.  It's a lot like reading about an actual person: very few people are simply classified as good or bad - instead, they have numerous aspects to their personalities that resonate well with some people and act as turn-offs to others.  The characters in this book are much the same...and with many of them doing or being witness to darker, nastier things in the second novel, there are plenty of opportunities for your opinions on certain characters to change."
27,0,0.14921536796536797,"On a random, character-related note, I'm pleased to see that Martin actually has a wide array of female characters.  I'll be honest and say that the stereotypical female tropes that pop up in the fantasy genre bug the Hell out of me: women tend to be either delicate damsels or kickass warriors, neither of which has ever struck me as particularly interesting or realistic.  In ""Clash of Kings,"" we're treated both to some of our favourite women from the first book as well as new heroines.  There are no stereotypes here and each character embodies her own strengths and flaws.  Sure, there are women who fall in line with the traditional gender roles of a medieval wife and those who prefer a more warrior-esque life (as well as many who lie somewhere in between), but they're so wonderfully characterized that they never become predictably stereotypical, nor are they overlooked in favour of the male characters.  A lot of authors could learn something from Martin: it's possible to write a varied female cast without them becoming stereotypes.  Furthermore, it never feels like a character is included to provide ""another female perspective"" (or another male perspective, for that matter) - they all matter and they all provide valuable insight into Westeros, the war, and their unique situations."
28,0,0.17247023809523807,"While there isn't a ""main character"" per se, if I had to pick a point of view character that features most prominently, it would definitely be Tyrion.  This is his book: how he rises to the lofty position of the King's Hand and how he uses his intellect and cunning to overcome his lack of physical prowess in a book that's largely about battles, knights, and their consequences.  While Tyrion isn't my favourite character, his perspective is always interesting since he has to go about things in a vastly different way than the book's other figures.  If you're a fan of Tyrion, this is your book!"
29,0,-0.034166666666666665,"""Clash of Kings"" is a solid follow up to ""Game of Thrones.""  It manages to be darker and grittier than its predecessor without coming off as gratuitous and continues the story without seeming like it's being unnecessarily dragged out.  Martin's writing and characters are just as satisfying as they were in the first book, and I finished the novel feeling like I needed to start the next one immediately (and I did - thank goodness I didn't have to wait!).  ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is a truly unique and refreshing entry in the fantasy genre...and it's impossible to stop reading after one (or even two) books."

Even though Joffrey doesn't mind a word his uncle says, Tyrion does not back down! He totally lets his halfwit nephew and his MEGABRAT of a sister have it!! And you are probably wondering about Daenerys. Well, she stuck out too, though not as much as her newly-hatched dragons. Even before I watch the second season, I understood the whole ""Where are my dragons?!"" thing. I would laugh if I knew how. And let us not forget Davos, the right-hand man of Stannis Baratheon.

Primarily because I, by no means, expected this story to be akin to the much-anticipated Winds of Winter. Also, I simply have higher expectations when purchasing an illustrated book, be it for children (though there has been some debate as to whether this is or is not a ""children's story"") or adults. When a book comes illustrated, the greater part of the reader's imagination retires throughout the reading experience and I honestly did not like Yvonne Gilbert's artwork in the previous edition of The Ice Dragon. This is not to say that Gilbert is not a fine artist. Her work simply did not align with my imaginings of Martin's world(s) and so I sadly put off The Ice Dragon with hopes that some day the proper stars would align and I would find myself reading it then."

I found Martin's story to be interesting and unique and I enjoyed the intimate fireside flow of The Ice Dragon. As I read, I felt like a Stark child listening to one of Old Nan's tales. I won't give away any spoilers but, for me, the ending was typically Martinesque and left me conflicted. As a ""Winter Child"" myself I wanted things to end differently for Adara and her dragon.

This was written by George RR Martin from the famous Game of Thrones.  It takes place before the GoT time frame when dragons still existed.  However, it is not necessary to know that.

For me, I loved the illustrations, each and every one.  The detail of each of these for me is worth the price of the book alone.  Drawing dragons is an exercise of insanity.

The characterization of the main person in the book was strong, with the reader feeling the loneliness and longing for a warm relationship with the family.  Still, you are drawn to the development of the acceptance of the Ice Dragon as well.

By the end, Martin leaves us with several cliff-hangers with very little resolved. This book does introduce several new characters some of which may or may not be important or even interesting.

The chapters I was interested in reading were about Cersi, Jaime and Brienne (in that order) and I didn’t get excited about Briennes part until the last chapter of her. Now I’m like WTF happened to her?! Anyway, back to Cersi, reading about her made me understand why she is like this. She wants to be treated as an equal so she does ruthless things that she believes men would do in her place. Still a bitch though. Jaime, he certainly changes after having his hand cut off and traveling with Brienne in the last book. I kind of felt bad for him, but I think he needed that to happen in order for him to change. Otherwise he’d still be a dick. I like that there was an underlining show of respect (or affection if you really wanted it that way) with Jaime and Brienne. A part of me wants them together lol The book also talked about Arya and Sansa. It was more about their journey of what they go through to end up where they should be in the next book or so.

Also the sound quality is muffled and much poorer than books 1-3.  After some research I found that someone named John Lee narrated this book originally because Mr. Dotrice was too ill to do it.  However apparently Random House had the book re-recorded by Mr. Dotrice at a later date due to fan demand.  THE BOOK I RECEIVED FROM AMAZON IS NOT THE ROY DOTRICE VERSION!

Also, I simply have higher expectations when purchasing an illustrated book, be it for children (though there has been some debate as to whether this is or is not a ""children's story"") or adults. When a book comes illustrated, the greater part of the reader's imagination retires throughout the reading experience and I honestly did not like Yvonne Gilbert's artwork in the previous edition of The Ice Dragon.

I don't want to get into reviewing plots or anything like that because that's already been done elsewhere. If you are considering the leather bound set, you do need to pay attention to the measurements and take a look at the customer images and reviews before you make a decision. These books are small and fat, with barely passable small print that a fair number of readers will need reading glasses to view. They are very much like the leather bound bibles that you can find in many churches and book stores."

I checked mine when they arrived and they were in perfect condition.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

If you enjoy brilliant, incredibly-developed, thought-provoking stories... those with a strongly developed cast of characters who blissfully lack being ""good vs. evil"" and instead all display their shades of grey, good traits, evil traits, unique traits, all sorts of traits... then this book is for you.

There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.  That character as portrayed by Peter Dinkwater was so much more complex and interesting.  His charm and wit fit with this handsome actor.  Brienne -- the same.

Likewise, there's no point in bringing more attention to the novels because they're already some of the most famous in fantasy. It's pretty much the same with the spin-offs as there's not much point in talking about Game of Thrones since everyone and their brother is watching that show."
168,0,0.0625,"  I've made an exception for Telltale's Game of Thrones because that's a side-story but this is the first book I feel comfortable recommending which might have slipped under fans' radars. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a compilation of three novellas (The Hedge Knight, The Sworn Sword, and The Mystery Knight) written by George R.R. Martin for various anthologies."
169,0,0.06166666666666667,"  The premise is a young hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall (a self-granted title since his master never knighted him), takes on a squire named Egg after the death of his mentor Ser Arlan. A hedge knight is a knight with no prestige or lineage but has the training as well as equipment to be a mounted soldier in the Seven Kingdoms. At the absolute bottom of the social hierarchy's warrior class but still part of it, Duncan has a unique perspective on events occurring in the century before A Game of Thrones."
170,0,0.14774410774410773,"  The three novellas take place in a very different Westeros from the one described in the books because the Targaryens are still at, if not the height of the rule then some distance from their twilight. The lands have been at peace for a decade and the nobility, if not following the example of chivalry in spirit, is at least trying to follow the example of chivalry in appearance. In a very real way, the book serves as an argument for a Targaryen Restoration because it shows everyone more or less getting along and the peasants able to live reasonably secure lives."
171,0,0.1492647058823529,"  George R.R. Martin, the father of grimdark, still treats the Medieval romance with a good deal of disdain but it's not nearly as cynical in many respects. Ser Duncan's basic decency makes him a far better knight than those born into the role but the absence of Gregor Cleganes, Boltons, Bloody Mummers, and even Lannisters make the villains of a decidedly more sympathetic bent. They're still very realistic fantasy with only the occasional prophetic dream keeping it from being absent magic together but the heart of the stories is a peasant-born warrior trying to navigate the complicated social dynamics of Westeros' knightly class."
172,0,0.104,"  The Hedge Knight is, in a weird way, not that dissimilar from Heath Ledger's A Knight's Tale. Duncan is a peasant knight from Fleabottom who has a vision of becoming a famous warrior after Ser Arlan's death. Unfortunately, Ser Duncan lacks William Thatcher's godlike skill with a lance and swiftly finds himself in hot water with a Targaryen prince. In a very real way, this is a sports story and the deadly stakes of the event make it all the more entertaining to read about. Of the three, The Hedge Knight is my least favorite as I never really found that much interest in jousting and its central role in peacetime Medieval life."
173,0,0.030000000000000006,"  The Sworn Sword is a follow up to The Hedge Knight where Duncan has managed to find himself as an actual proper sworn knight to a lord--sort of. Having taken up service to a lord of something which barely qualifies as a tower, Duncan ends up caught up in a conflict between his lord and the beautiful widow across the river. The central conflict turns out to be not one of good and evil but the legacy of a war which had, to quote George Lucas, heroes on both sides. I like how it managed to take a very Medieval concept of fighting for a ladies' honor and play it straight while also illustrating how absurd it was."
174,0,0.275,"  The Mystery Knight is, bluntly, one of my favorite stories in fantasy. I've re-read this novella five times and am probably going to do so again. It's a story with a lot of parallels to Bonnie Prince Charlie's revolt and is basically a Medieval spy novel set against the backdrop of a tournament. I love the characters of Lord Butterwell, the Fiddler, and Fireball's bastard. They are eccentric, larger than life, and yet believable. I also loved finally getting a chance to meet"
175,0,0.4673611111111111,"  These stories are,obviously, going to be enjoyed more by fans of the books than by the show. Aside from the possible relationship between Duncan and Brienne, many of the details of the history will fly by television viewers. Despite this, I think they would be enjoyable even to those who have no experience with the world. Fans of grimdark will find the stories a good deal more idealistic and pleasant but still possessed of the moral ambiguity as well as ""realism"" which made the original books so enjoyable."
176,0,0.145,"  The chief draw of the books for me is the relationship between Ser Duncan and Egg. Duncan is, to be honest, dumb but decent while Egg is highly-intelligent and somewhat more ruthless than his master. The contrast between their social positions, viewpoints, and attitudes provides an endless array of interesting conversations. It's kind of sad I know how their story works out due to The World of Ice and Fire but their tale is one I could follow through its own series. They're hilarious, insightful, and fun together--and what more can you ask from your heroes?"
177,0,0.37857142857142856,"  In conclusion, I really really recommend this book. I almost wish George R.R. Martin would take more time from The Winds of Winter to do more of these stories. They're fun, light, and entertaining reads which deserve to be looked into. This version of the story is illustrated and while I tend to prefer the comic book versions of these story, it lends a sort of ""Illustrated King Arthur"" feel to things."

Suffice it to say Ser Duncan is delightful to follow as an everyday common hero. Egg is terrific. Most of all Martin writes here in a style of old that flows like water and goes down smooth. He lets you chuckle when appropriate while painting a picture so vivid it fills the room. I couldn’t put it down and that’s the best compliment I can give a writer.

Taking place a century before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire, the story follows Ser Duncan, a man who was recently knighted before his master passed away. While traveling to a tourney, he meets a bald boy named Egg who, despite Duncan's efforts to have it otherwise, becomes his squire. Duncan learns some surprising things while at the tourney, but ends up making a name for himself in front of the Targaryans, who are the family of kings and queens in Westeros. Afterwards, he and Egg have several adventures, including trying to help a disgraced lord save his lands and his smallfolk (peasants) from a drought while a rival house is taking all the resources, and participating in a tourney while looking for a performer that is hinted that Duncan might have feelings for. Underneath it all is the threat of the embers of a rebellion that had been beaten years ago, but is struggling to rise to power again. Will Duncan and Egg be able to help the Seven Kingdoms?"

Martin has promised more in this storyline, but my hope is he expands the plot to novel-length rather than giving us a book of three or four short stories. One thing readers may appreciate in this book, over the ASOIAF series, is that there is less tragedy and, since the lives of our two heroes are already ""written"" as it were, the reader does not have to worry about them dying in a bloody mess (at least not until they are much, much older). There is also notably no sex in these stories, and very little profanity. While not written for a young audience, the book is different from his other novels in that respect."

Along the way he meets Egg who, like Dunk, may just be more than he seems. It's a short little novella, but is full of all those things that have given Martin the following he has. Westeros has always to me felt like our world with slight changes. It doesn't take much to imagine it clearly, as Martin paints it so vividly.

We are treated to some juicy Westeros history in this one, as we follow Dunk during his time as Ser Eustace Osgrey's sworn sword; a knight whose house, previously of renown and good standing, is down on its luck. Ser Eustace and his men fought in the Blackfyre Rebellion, which is an intensely interesting portion of ASOIAF history, and I was pleased to hear more about it through his recollections. Bloodraven is also a frequent topic of discussion, as he is the King's Hand during the time of this story, and that was interesting to hear."

Where GoT and the other books are ponderous and turgid, and disgusting with rancid descriptions of poo and blood and death, The Dunk & Egg Show is instead charming. I get the feeling that George R.R.

I don’t think very much new information is included that is not already present in World of Ice and Fire.

This  fantasy ""sword and sorcery"" collection contains a range of stories, so of course some will appeal to some people and others to other people, but by and large this ""sword and sorcery"" collection fell flat to me. Holland, Parker, Liu, and Cherryh wrote fairly good tales, so if you are a big fan of one of these authors you might want to look at this book. Martin's own short story was a weak, dry telling of past Westeros history. Where Martin excels is in making complex characters live and suffer and become real to the reader, but his recent short story work just seems to sound like dry history of an imaginary place."

I don't want to get into reviewing plots or anything like that because that's already been done elsewhere. If you are considering the leather bound set, you do need to pay attention to the measurements and take a look at the customer images and reviews before you make a decision. These books are small and fat, with barely passable small print that a fair number of readers will need reading glasses to view.

This is an ancient world, not like our own. He allows that story to happen without foisting modern sensibilities on it.

265,0,0.026652892561983475,"What could be said about Game of Thrones, the first of George R.R. Martin's epic series, that hasn't been said a million times? It's absolutely brilliant. Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

If you enjoy brilliant, incredibly-developed, thought-provoking stories... those with a strongly developed cast of characters who blissfully lack being ""good vs. evil"" and instead all display their shades of grey, good traits, evil traits, unique traits, all sorts of traits... then this book is for you.

My eyes crossed over the endless descriptions of every morsel of food cooked or eaten, along with the emblems/heraldry of even the most minor character.  There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.  That character as portrayed by Peter Dinkwater was so much more complex and interesting.  His charm and wit fit with this handsome actor.  Brienne -- the same.

284,0,0.15541666666666668,"How can Martin write SO many pages yet have so little happen? I mean, if you want to know what a character is eating to break their fast, or what color someone's surcoat or tokar is, or what color the bricks of a city are that day, or that words are wind, then this book will be riveting to you. And are we supposed to care more about Westeros or Essos? Becasue ADWD sure is Essos-centric. In fact, 99% of Martin's world seems to be made up of it, with the people living there viewing Westeros as some insignificant backwater. Reading AGoT, I thought that part of the world would just be a jumping-off point for Daenerys. But no, it now has become the virtual main setting of ASOIAF. Why did Martin make that decision? I want to find out what happens in Westeros. Or do I? I'm not sure what the reader is supposed to be focused on because Martin is just all over the place. Toward the end of the book, Dany hallucinates and talks to Jorah Mormont who reiterates that he told her to go to Westeros because Meereen was not where she belonged. I felt as if Martin was mocking us because it's what every frickin' reader would have told her as well. So why did you make us read hundreds of pages about her fretting away in Meereen?! And, at the end, she seemingly ends ups in the same place she was in AGoT!"

I'm sure some readers do, but do most of us care at all about characters like Asha, Victarion, and Euron? Even Theon/Reek got old by the second half of the book. And honestly, are we supposed to care about what happens to the the billions of people in Meereen like the Brazen Beasts, Stormcrows, Sons of the Harpy, Hizdahr, etc.? Everyone in Meereen, save a couple, are pretty much terrible people and I couldn't care less what their ultimate fate is."

But, my goodness, nothing uplifting at all happens. It's just one gloomy event after another and everyone is either angry, oppressed, or psychotic. Martin goes out of his way to ensure that absolutely nothing remotely pleasant happens. I understand there are books with such tones, but after nearly 5,000 pages of it, you get a bit worn down. I know a big appeal of the series are the ""gray"" characterizations, and I agree, but does nearly everyone have to be a murderous sociopath with no regard for human life? This worked in the first three books because we weren't sure what characters we were going to root for or against.

Usually, I'd just abandon a book I wasn't enjoying, but after reading 4,000 pages of the series I couldn't quit on it. Books 1-3 were fantastic. A Feast For Crows began the downslide but I figured it was merely setup. But ADWD was even worse than setup because NOTHING HAPPENS. I'm really torn over whether I'll read The Winds of Winter if and when it's released. I don't think I have it in me to read another novel like ADWD. I only started this series a few months ago, so I read all these books back-to-back (excluding the one I read three-quarters of the way through ADWD to keep my sanity), so I saw the decline of storytelling with this series happen in real time."

The word painting is incredible, he is able to transport readers in to his world, and he leaves you desperately wanting more.  I still have not seen one single episode, but I have seen far more of this world than any viewer has.  Great book.  Now, that being said, I am livid that the story simply STOPS, leaving every single character and situation hanging in limbo.  There is no resolution for anyone or anything.  Oh, please, Mr. Martin, finish this series before I am forced to contaminate my perceptions by finally watching the show (which I know does not follow the book exactly, and geez, how does your mind pictures compare to the commercial pictures?).  Fortunately, or not, my daughters and I spend a lot of time discussing what they are seeing versus what I am reading, and I at least have some idea where my beloved Tyrion goes.

Bran is openly one; Jon has warg tendencies which he hides but which others suspect, and his enemies taunt him with it.

The story as written is different in many ways from the TV series. I don't mind that at all. Surprisingly, the author Martin did not have all the gratuitous sex as the TV series, but I guess that's what sells on TV.

I will not buy Books 6 through Infinity as I don't want to read about unrelenting hatred, gratuitous violence, baby killing, blood sacrifice, grotesque animal abuse, face eating and/or excrement eating, body fluids, gore, little boys being thrown overboard because ""their kind"" shouldn't be allowed to live, and men whose only use for women is to ""take"" them forcibly as a prelude to killing them.

The quantity of characters is so vast that one loses interest in some of them.  The first book was amazing and the first 3 together were very, very enjoyable.  I'm disappointed in the last two and frustrated that we have what started out as a fascinating journey turn into ""a maze of twisty passages, all alike"" (for those of you who remember the old Adventure game).

309,0,0.29120370370370374,"As a fan of the aSoIaF series, I have to say, I understand why the series has come under scrutiny post-Storm of Swords. After that book, which was the best in the series (well-plotted, fast moving, just overall awesome), a Feast for Crows was released, which showed a noticeable slowing down of things. I believe George RR Martin, while still being able to write beautifully and create whole characters, has lost his ability of pacing the story well. Ultimately, A Dance with Dragons, like aFfC, suffers the same problems, but this time even more so than its predecessor."
310,0,0.0,"At least in aFfC, things were kicking into high-gear in the last 150 pages or so. A Dance with Dragons only became exciting to me in the last chapter and the epilogue. The first three books were filled with exciting moments placed throughout the story--that's why they call them 'page-turners'. Getting through this book at times was a struggle. When I got to chapters that I knew would be boring (Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, for example), the only thing that got me through it was flipping ahead and seeing that a Reek or Arya chapter was soon to follow. Don't get me wrong, I like Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, but particularly with Dany's story in Meereen, barely ANYTHING happens in the book. It is paced so poorly that I really feel like half of her chapters could've been axed. Also, what is up with the ONE Jaime chapter in which, again, basically nothing happens? Martin ended aFfC with this huge (and kind of lame) cliffhanger with Brienne...and when we finally see her again, we learn absolutely nothing. We're just left with another cliffhanger, this one just lamer than the last."

He seems like a menacing guy, and I can't wait to see how he ties into the main plot concerning Dany."

Fans are still invested in this story and these characters, but please, get things moving!

Likewise, there's no point in bringing more attention to the novels because they're already some of the most famous in fantasy. It's pretty much the same with the spin-offs as there's not much point in talking about Game of Thrones since everyone and their brother is watching that show."
332,0,0.0625,"  I've made an exception for Telltale's Game of Thrones because that's a side-story but this is the first book I feel comfortable recommending which might have slipped under fans' radars. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a compilation of three novellas (The Hedge Knight, The Sworn Sword, and The Mystery Knight) written by George R.R. Martin for various anthologies."
333,0,0.06166666666666667,"  The premise is a young hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall (a self-granted title since his master never knighted him), takes on a squire named Egg after the death of his mentor Ser Arlan. A hedge knight is a knight with no prestige or lineage but has the training as well as equipment to be a mounted soldier in the Seven Kingdoms. At the absolute bottom of the social hierarchy's warrior class but still part of it, Duncan has a unique perspective on events occurring in the century before A Game of Thrones."
334,0,0.14774410774410773,"  The three novellas take place in a very different Westeros from the one described in the books because the Targaryens are still at, if not the height of the rule then some distance from their twilight. The lands have been at peace for a decade and the nobility, if not following the example of chivalry in spirit, is at least trying to follow the example of chivalry in appearance. In a very real way, the book serves as an argument for a Targaryen Restoration because it shows everyone more or less getting along and the peasants able to live reasonably secure lives."
335,0,0.1492647058823529,"  George R.R. Martin, the father of grimdark, still treats the Medieval romance with a good deal of disdain but it's not nearly as cynical in many respects. Ser Duncan's basic decency makes him a far better knight than those born into the role but the absence of Gregor Cleganes, Boltons, Bloody Mummers, and even Lannisters make the villains of a decidedly more sympathetic bent. They're still very realistic fantasy with only the occasional prophetic dream keeping it from being absent magic together but the heart of the stories is a peasant-born warrior trying to navigate the complicated social dynamics of Westeros' knightly class."
336,0,0.104,"  The Hedge Knight is, in a weird way, not that dissimilar from Heath Ledger's A Knight's Tale. Duncan is a peasant knight from Fleabottom who has a vision of becoming a famous warrior after Ser Arlan's death. Unfortunately, Ser Duncan lacks William Thatcher's godlike skill with a lance and swiftly finds himself in hot water with a Targaryen prince. In a very real way, this is a sports story and the deadly stakes of the event make it all the more entertaining to read about. Of the three, The Hedge Knight is my least favorite as I never really found that much interest in jousting and its central role in peacetime Medieval life."
337,0,0.030000000000000006,"  The Sworn Sword is a follow up to The Hedge Knight where Duncan has managed to find himself as an actual proper sworn knight to a lord--sort of. Having taken up service to a lord of something which barely qualifies as a tower, Duncan ends up caught up in a conflict between his lord and the beautiful widow across the river. The central conflict turns out to be not one of good and evil but the legacy of a war which had, to quote George Lucas, heroes on both sides. I like how it managed to take a very Medieval concept of fighting for a ladies' honor and play it straight while also illustrating how absurd it was."
338,0,0.275,"  The Mystery Knight is, bluntly, one of my favorite stories in fantasy. I've re-read this novella five times and am probably going to do so again. It's a story with a lot of parallels to Bonnie Prince Charlie's revolt and is basically a Medieval spy novel set against the backdrop of a tournament. I love the characters of Lord Butterwell, the Fiddler, and Fireball's bastard. They are eccentric, larger than life, and yet believable. I also loved finally getting a chance to meet"
339,0,0.4673611111111111,"  These stories are,obviously, going to be enjoyed more by fans of the books than by the show. Aside from the possible relationship between Duncan and Brienne, many of the details of the history will fly by television viewers. Despite this, I think they would be enjoyable even to those who have no experience with the world. Fans of grimdark will find the stories a good deal more idealistic and pleasant but still possessed of the moral ambiguity as well as ""realism"" which made the original books so enjoyable."
340,0,0.145,"  The chief draw of the books for me is the relationship between Ser Duncan and Egg. Duncan is, to be honest, dumb but decent while Egg is highly-intelligent and somewhat more ruthless than his master. The contrast between their social positions, viewpoints, and attitudes provides an endless array of interesting conversations. It's kind of sad I know how their story works out due to The World of Ice and Fire but their tale is one I could follow through its own series. They're hilarious, insightful, and fun together--and what more can you ask from your heroes?"
341,0,0.37857142857142856,"  In conclusion, I really really recommend this book. I almost wish George R.R. Martin would take more time from The Winds of Winter to do more of these stories. They're fun, light, and entertaining reads which deserve to be looked into. This version of the story is illustrated and while I tend to prefer the comic book versions of these story, it lends a sort of ""Illustrated King Arthur"" feel to things."

Suffice it to say Ser Duncan is delightful to follow as an everyday common hero. Egg is terrific. Most of all Martin writes here in a style of old that flows like water and goes down smooth. He lets you chuckle when appropriate while painting a picture so vivid it fills the room. I couldn’t put it down and that’s the best compliment I can give a writer.

346,0,0.24,"This book is actually three books merged into one. Taking place a century before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire, the story follows Ser Duncan, a man who was recently knighted before his master passed away. While traveling to a tourney, he meets a bald boy named Egg who, despite Duncan's efforts to have it otherwise, becomes his squire. Duncan learns some surprising things while at the tourney, but ends up making a name for himself in front of the Targaryans, who are the family of kings and queens in Westeros. Afterwards, he and Egg have several adventures, including trying to help a disgraced lord save his lands and his smallfolk (peasants) from a drought while a rival house is taking all the resources, and participating in a tourney while looking for a performer that is hinted that Duncan might have feelings for. Underneath it all is the threat of the embers of a rebellion that had been beaten years ago, but is struggling to rise to power again. Will Duncan and Egg be able to help the Seven Kingdoms?"

It helps add to the world's history, and allows us to see characters we read about in The World of Ice and Fire to get some attention. While not as intense as the series A Song of Ice and Fire, it still has that flare of Martin's to explore real people facing real medieval problems. The illustrations done by Gary Gianni also help bring this world and time period to life. It's definitely worth reading."

Martin has promised more in this storyline, but my hope is he expands the plot to novel-length rather than giving us a book of three or four short stories. One thing readers may appreciate in this book, over the ASOIAF series, is that there is less tragedy and, since the lives of our two heroes are already ""written"" as it were, the reader does not have to worry about them dying in a bloody mess (at least not until they are much, much older). There is also notably no sex in these stories, and very little profanity. While not written for a young audience, the book is different from his other novels in that respect."

Along the way he meets Egg who, like Dunk, may just be more than he seems. It's a short little novella, but is full of all those things that have given Martin the following he has. Westeros has always to me felt like our world with slight changes. It doesn't take much to imagine it clearly, as Martin paints it so vividly. In some alternate reality, it would be our own deep history but slightly larger, a tough more grand. A world as varied and realistic as our own."

It takes place around two years after the first story, and I think it was every bit as good, maybe even a little better. We are treated to some juicy Westeros history in this one, as we follow Dunk during his time as Ser Eustace Osgrey's sworn sword; a knight whose house, previously of renown and good standing, is down on its luck. Ser Eustace and his men fought in the Blackfyre Rebellion, which is an intensely interesting portion of ASOIAF history, and I was pleased to hear more about it through his recollections. Bloodraven is also a frequent topic of discussion, as he is the King's Hand during the time of this story, and that was interesting to hear."

376,0,0.075625,"Though the Game of Thrones series drives me mad, I found myself to be enjoying this series of three related novellas very much indeed. Probably becaus it focuses on two characters, the sorry-excuse-for-a-knight-but-brave-and-goodhearted knight Dunk and the young squire who is far more than he seems, Egg (real name Aegon). Where GoT and the other books are ponderous and turgid, and disgusting with rancid descriptions of poo and blood and death, The Dunk & Egg Show is instead charming. I get the feeling that George R.R. Martin's editors reined him considerably on this one, much to the book's improvement.

I really hope they plan on doing this with the rest of the series because i will be the first to buy them.

392,0,0.09666666666666668,"The vast majority of pictures feel like black and white photo copies.  These black and white pictures are placed at the beginning of each chapter.  Many feature the most dramatic scene from within the chapter.  This unfortunate arrangement results in starting several chapters with a spoiler.  I first noticed this on page 140 at the beginning of Catelyn's chapter.  There is a picture of Summer mauling the man with the knife.  This scene does not occur until page 145.  It would have been stronger to have this picture on page 146.  This happens again and again.  Maybe not a huge deal if you have already read the series but I would have greatly preferred it if the publisher had cared enough to figure out the best location for each picture within the story.  A first time reader should definitely steer clear.  Also, it may have looked nicer if the images did not fill the entire page edge to edge with no margins or decorative border, but that is just a stylistic choice."

Page 764 was on page 9.  Page 486 was on pg 46.  Inexplicably, pg 268 has a picture of Ser Elmo Tully from pg 160.  That just feels sloppy."

They serve to make the black and white pictures more disappointing by the comparison.  A few of these are placed more appropriately within the story.  But not all.  Aroung page 436 a picture from the previous Bran chapter appears within a Tyrion chapter.  Plus this picture is all wrong as it has Theon aiming at Stiv from the front not from behind.  The picture after page 757 shows what will happen to Ned on page 761.  Big spoiler there.  A great picture of Dany is at the end of a Jon chapter instead of at the end of the book."

Don't get me wrong --  I like reading-- just not fiction. When it comes to fiction, I'd rather just watch the movie -- weird, I know but so many details get missed in movie adaptations of good books that I'd just as soon not ""waste"" 6-8 hours reading the fictional work, getting pumped for movie release and then being inevitably disappointed about what the directors forgot or what they took liberties with in the movie."

Yes, the forward actually goes out of its way to spoil three moments in the book, perhaps under the ridiculous assumption that you've already seen the HBO TV series and excusing them as ""being easy to see coming"" and ""foreshadowing"". The man who wrote the forward not only comes across as arrogant and nasty, but bumbling and dull headed."

While beautiful, a good chunk of them (perhaps a fourth) are actually placed in the wrong chapters or flat out spoil events that will happen in the future. Again with the spoilers; it strikes me that the editors for this edition have no regard for the integrity of the work and care more for filling the pages with pretty colors. This problem could very easily be solved by only placing illustrations at the end of chapters (showing events that have happened or are happening at the chapter close) or by placing all of the illustrations at the end of the book. Placing them at the beginning of the chapter (with some near the end of certain key chapters) only serves to spoil the upcoming events.

I am very pleased with it. My only complaint is that the pages are a bit thin. Which if your going to make a beautiful 20 year edition of the book you might as well go all out and use thicker paper. All in all though it looks beautiful. Well worth the money. I just can't wait for the others to come out.

I thought there were plenty of illustrations, though some are placed in odd locations within the story content, but my two main quibbles are 1) the sticker on the back and 2) the red title band that wraps around the cover. The sticker is removable but of course leaves a residue behind - for those who don't know, after carefully removing the sticker and any paper bits left behind, use a very small amount (nickel-size) of olive oil on a paper towel and wipe over the residue using a little pressure to remove the residue. Then use another paper towel very slightly damp and wipe off the remaining olive oil. Wiping in small circles with a little bit of pressure works best. You can probably get some kind of cleaner for this but I was worried anything like that might damage the cover. Olive oil does the job with no damage, just don't get it inside the book!"

410,0,0.0,This is not a story book; it’s a history book and it’s written as such.  The idea is that Maester Yandel wrote this book as a gift to the king. (The Baratheons get treated quite favorably in this tome; this is a Maester who is trying to get somewhere.)

If not, you may not—though you will love the beautiful illustrations, the embossed dragons on the front cover and the parchment-like background designs.  And you will love the way this book feels.  It’s wonderfully constructed.  The covers are padded and the pages are sewn to the book’s spine.  And the pages themselves are not the cheap-feeling pages you normally get; they’re thick and slightly glossy. So the illustrations and the construction are superb."

I was particularly interested in the legends the Maester mentions again and again only to dismiss them as a learned man is taught to do.  Anyone who has either read R. R.

It was written by a maester for King Robert Baratheon, and you'll notice the language becomes very flowery when his reign is mentioned.  Some topics mentioned did not make it into the TV show until at least a year or two after the book was published.  It offers a detailed account of events of the past deeds of Tywin Lannister, and you kinda see why he was like he was.  The front and back covers are padded and feel very high-quality.  The artwork all throughout this book is nothing short of amazing.  It's worth the price just for that if you don't feel like reading it.  There are pictures on almost every page, but it may still take awhile to read due to small type and double-column format.  Also included is a Targaryen family tree, which is more complicated and has more branches than you would expect.  It becomes very hard to keep up with the ones of that family who are mentioned in the historical narrative because SO MANY of the Targaryens have the same names.  For those of us who have yet to read the Game of Thrones books, this one is a great read.  Very informative and well worth your time."

420,0,0.35696428571428573,"As far as the text, which many of the reviews here are quick to slam or to praise, I felt the truth was in the middle and uneven would be the best word to describe.  Some of the narratives are very well done - the ""short story"" of the Conquest, the reign of King Jaehaerys, and the history of the Vale in particular stood out as well done; the narrative flowed well, and the characterizations were very satisfying, but most importantly gave itself identity and value.  As far as a common identifier of the best pieces, the text is at its best and finds a nice rhythm when it becomes character-centric as opposed to purely event-centric.  When Martin et. immerse you in the rich characterizations of Nymeria, Aegon, Robar Royce, and Tywin, and let the history flow around them is extremely enjoyable."
421,0,-0.03012820512820513,"Other portions were frustrating - several histories of reigns and a couple of the Kingdoms really felt like obligated filler as opposed to a seized opportunity to provide rich lore, and all too often the ""Untold History"" teased on the cover produced only empty text containing no more than ""going through the motions"" summations of previously known information,providing no additional lore or color.  It is understandable in areas where it's obvious that Martin isn't ready to show his cards; others such as the War of the Ninepenny Kings from a 10,000 foot view and the Greyjoy Rebellion being reduced to a couple paragraphs and passing on the opportunity to add color and depth as opposed to regurgitation due to necessity were a letdown."
422,0,0.025000000000000022,"The choice of the maester as a point of view was overall a sound decision.  The additional layer adds richness: bias is introduced, sources are referenced, and the environment of the ASOIAF novels needs to be taken into account by the reader - a very Martin-esque move.  The ""cop outs"", where the decision to use a maester as the writer leads to lack of expansion or evasion were an unfortunate consequence."
423,0,0.24687499999999998,"As far as the artwork, I expected the illustrations to be filler, almost an annoyance beside the lore.  It was the exact opposite - the illustrations are impressive, most absolutely stunning.  The amount of artwork, fantastic detail, and affording a quality template for the production really stood out.  I'm not sold that AWOIAF will be a frequent reread or that the table of contents and index reference enough consistency in the text for it to serve as a reference, but there will definitely be portions worth a bookmark and others worth perusing at times, and the art is worth a complete page through anytime."
424,0,0.32708333333333334,"I won’t waste time trying to add to the many 4-Star & 5-Star reviews already posted since the have pretty much covered it all. I will say this is a striking object, with a plush, leathery cover that I don’t find on many modern books. The paper quality is first class and the illustrations are magnificent.  If I wrote a book I would show my publisher this book and say, “I want my book to have the high-quality feel of this cover and the paper”. Definitely something best appreciated by the serious ASOIAF fan. It’s not a novel written from the first person perspective like the series. It’s a history book that’s supposed to be written by a Maester living after the events of Roberts Rebellion. It starts in the ancient world of the Dawn Age, covers the Children of the Forest, the migration of the First Men to Westeros, the arrival of the Andals, the Doom of Valyria, and a lot more. You get some good information on the uniting of the 7 Kingdoms by Aegon I “The Conquerer” and his sister queens Visenya and Rhenyra that Arya recounts to Tywin Lannister when reserving as his cupbearer in the HBO series. Since it’s written more around the events than many of the people, some readers may find it dry like history book, but that’s essentially what it is. Overall a beautiful object worth the money for those who wonder about the world of GoT/ASOIAF."

And the fact that it tells the story of Westeros from the beginning of time and before all the events in the Games of Thrones is simply amazing.

The pages are THICK and and full of colorful illustrations. I love that there are side notes to identify who/what is in the picture. This is not a book with dialogue between characters, but it is rich in history and full of information that could potentially be a foundation for multiple prequels of the Game of Thrones book/television series.

As a result, there is very little information that has not already been included in the Song of Fire and Ice. There are tedious recitations of family lineages for each of the major houses in Westeros but there are no stories or personalities to match to the names. The history is told from such a distance that there is no character development and no emotional attachment."

436,0,0.26125,"Without offering any spoilers, here's an overview of the Dragon's Hoard campaign. The adventures in this book are inspired by a throwaway line from the first book in George R.R. Martin's fantasy series and hearken back to the last days of the Targaryen dynasty, when Robert's Rebellion against King Aerys II was gaining momentum and all of the Seven Kingdoms were in disarray. Drawing inspiration from events of long ago was kind of genius, since so many of George R.R. Martin's own story lines from the novels hinge upon things which happened during the same period (e.g., John Snow's parentage, the legitimacy of Griff's claim to Targaryen blood, etc)-- giving the player characters their own mystery dating back to the days of Robert's Rebellion feels very much in the spirit of the original series."
437,0,0.11078431372549022,"The adventures themselves are set throughout the Seven Kingdoms and the free city of Braavos, and do a great job of presenting players with a wide variety of different challenges over the course of their travels. Some scenarios can be solved with brute force, others through logic and deduction, while still others require a deft amount of diplomacy, subtlety, and tact. Presenting such a wide variety of challenges ensures that each of your players will have ample opportunity to contribute to the overall success or failure of their House throughout the campaign, whether they're a brave knight or a scheming householder or a pious septon, practically guaranteeing that everyone at the table has at least a few chances to be the story's hero.  This balanced approach to the game is extremely important in any Song of Ice and Fire campaign, since it prevents anyone from being left out."
438,0,0.19563492063492063,"Most of the adventures in this campaign can be interspersed with your own original adventures, if desired, allowing the campaign story-line to be inserted gradually into an existing campaign; the overall story arc is such an important part of these adventures, though, that they probably wouldn't work very well as stand-alone scenarios without undergoing a major overhaul. To me, this seems like a massive waste of time, especially since the campaign is already so well thought-out and beautifully-written-- there's no reason to buy a campaign supplement as good as this one and then use anything less than the full campaign. A couple of the adventures in Dragon's Hoard are time-sensitive races against the clock, and really need to be run consecutively with each other.  The campaign itself works best with a little advance set-up, in terms of introducing some non-player characters to the group ahead of time, especially if some of these characters can be incorporated into the players' household during house creation-- although there are also tons of great suggestions for introducing this campaign to an existing game, without any advance setup."
439,0,0.11428571428571428,"One thing that I really liked about Dragon's Hoard is that the rewards at the end of the campaign can be adjusted to suit the style of your game.  It's possible for players to acquire vast wealth, or heightened status, or legendary fame, or some combination of the three, if they make solid decisions throughout the course of the game. This open-ended approach also allows the GM to tailor the rewards to suit the players' expectations and in proportion to their in-game accomplishments."

They were really pretty and paper quality was very good. But the down side is they are really small books. So I got the paperback edition books. These books are bigger than leather bound and easy to read. So it totally depends on the customer what size book you would like to buy. I attached a photo to compare. Hope this helps

I don't want to get into reviewing plots or anything like that because that's already been done elsewhere. If you are considering the leather bound set, you do need to pay attention to the measurements and take a look at the customer images and reviews before you make a decision. These books are small and fat, with barely passable small print that a fair number of readers will need reading glasses to view.

I checked mine when they arrived and they were in perfect condition.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.  That character as portrayed by Peter Dinkwater was so much more complex and interesting.  His charm and wit fit with this handsome actor.  Brienne -- the same.

I've followed this series since the beginning and I've always been the one drooling over the delicious food I see them eating. I made Crusty White Bread and Medieval Creme Bastard from The Wall, Honeyed Chicken from The North, and Lemonsweet from Dorne. The bread held it's shape and was fairly easy to make. It says to knead it but if you are using a mixer, be careful not to over mix it or it will end up being dense. It was crunchy on the outside and oooo so soft on the inside. If you hold it up, it makes the crunching sound when you push on it. The chicken was delicious. I was wary of the apple cider vinegar because it made the sauce smell quite strong but it was delicious. Don't be fooled by the vinegar smell. YUM! For dessert, creme bastard was delicious. The cream was not overly sweet and the burst of the frozen blueberries made for a happy plate from me and my guest. Lastly, the Lemonsweet took some elbow grease from juicing. The fresh taste of this beverage is everything. I will admit, it is very sweet. If you don't care for overly sweet drinks, this might not be for you but for me...I was in heaven. This entire dinner put me in the spirit for GoT Season 7 Episode 2. I would recommend this book to any GoT lover. It will not disappoint you!"

I love that there is a medieval and modern version to each recipe, and they are different enough to be worth trying both. My first round was Medieval Leek Soup and Modern Beef and Bacon Pie, which my roommate renamed them Reek Soup and Frey Pie. The pie is fantastically photogenic, and I changed the filling to a chicken pot pie for round two with equally popular results.

Now I know not everyone is a Game of Thrones fan, and I've even tried to not dismiss the non-fans from my life, but this is a hard one. While George R.R. Martin throws in a lot of food descriptions and moments at the table, he's not exactly giving ingredient lists or techniques (we're talking the books here, not the TV series). The authors don't let that stop them, and have managed to delve into what amounts to medieval English cooking and modern English cooking, and find a strangely satisfying balance. They speculate on classic dishes that come close to fitting the descriptions of what Martin meanders on about, try it out, present it, photograph it (beautifully I might add), and then in many of the cases, turn around and come up with a modern take on the same dish or ingredients, and do the same. The one drawback, in some ways, is the subject matter - though it may be my own failing, I don't think there was a single recipe that enticed me to try making it - it felt like the kind of food one might make for a dinner party of fans of either the books or TV series, but probably for little other reason."

Also, I simply have higher expectations when purchasing an illustrated book, be it for children (though there has been some debate as to whether this is or is not a ""children's story"") or adults. When a book comes illustrated, the greater part of the reader's imagination retires throughout the reading experience and I honestly did not like Yvonne Gilbert's artwork in the previous edition of The Ice Dragon.

I won't give away any spoilers but, for me, the ending was typically Martinesque and left me conflicted. As a ""Winter Child"" myself I wanted things to end differently for Adara and her dragon.

Plus, it was a shorter story than I thought it would be; definitely not for an older girl.  Luckily I have a granddaughter who just turned 8 so I decided to give this to her.  I read the book in an hour myself so it isn't a long book.  And if your kiddo is not at the level to read by themselves it would certainly be a good nighttime book for a parent to read to the child.  This was written by George RR Martin from the famous Game of Thrones.  It takes place before the GoT time frame when dragons still existed.  However, it is not necessary to know that.  It is a light-hearted  and this is supposed to be years before that time frame story in itself."

The book was worth it just for that. I was debating on a kindle book or hardback. Glad I got the hardback (it is also cheaper than the kindle) as I can appreciate the art on paper more than on a screen. The girl looks a lot like a girl from a book that was published in the 1950's.

The Ice Dragon is a small cute story about a little girl in the frozen north.  The story itself is something that the wonders of Disney could do a whole movie about.  For me, I loved the illustrations, each and every one.  The detail of each of these for me is worth the price of the book alone.  Drawing dragons is an exercise of insanity.  Drawing dragons with this level of detail is simply amazing.  I was very impressed.  Besides, it gives us something to read and wonder at while we are all restlessly waiting for the next book if and when they finally do arrive."

However, as I leave no cereal box or book in my possession unread, I spent a pleasant afternoon with this book.  The  now famous imagery of George RR Martin did not falter here.  The characterization of the main person in the book was strong, with the reader feeling the loneliness and longing for a warm relationship with the family.  Still, you are drawn to the development of the acceptance of the Ice Dragon as well.  The climax and resolution were not unexpected, but still well done by Mr. Martin, as not one, but all, characters had to accept the inevitability of life, death, and loss.  This acceptance is maturity.  A good story for all."

The revised edition book provides a very thorough explanation of the world (though it's expanded upon on the Campaign Guide) and includes a few starting adventures (including the epic-length ""Kings Landing"" adventure).

Now I’m not really worried about the pages being bent or improperly cut cause it’s going to be used quite a bit, but I did pay the full price for a new copy. Like I said I’m not really worried about it in the long run, returning items is a big hassle for something as small as two pages worth of damage."

I don't want to get into reviewing plots or anything like that because that's already been done elsewhere. If you are considering the leather bound set, you do need to pay attention to the measurements and take a look at the customer images and reviews before you make a decision.

By that, I mean there is rampant sexism, violence, etc. Not pretty elements, but the author is not casting a modern eye on them apologizing for every undesirable trait. This is an ancient world, not like our own. He allows that story to happen without foisting modern sensibilities on it.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

If you enjoy brilliant, incredibly-developed, thought-provoking stories... those with a strongly developed cast of characters who blissfully lack being ""good vs. evil"" and instead all display their shades of grey, good traits, evil traits, unique traits, all sorts of traits... then this book is for you.

My eyes crossed over the endless descriptions of every morsel of food cooked or eaten, along with the emblems/heraldry of even the most minor character.  There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.  That character as portrayed by Peter Dinkwater was so much more complex and interesting.  His charm and wit fit with this handsome actor.  Brienne -- the same.

At any rate, this DVD is simply AMAZING! Another high-quality show from Steve! Such an amazing tour! He was also joined by Steven Wilson and John Wetton!!! His bassist Nick Beggs was simply an amazing guy to watch! Nick also plays and tours with Steven Wilson. But of course watching Mr. Hackett play guitar was the absolute highlight! There is no one who plays as brilliantly and with such range of emotion as Steve does. So very, very skilled and gifted. All the musicians performances were top-notch. It just doesn't get much better than this! Also got to relive many old Genesis songs and moments! Sometimes brought tears to the eyes!

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.

Some of Tolkien's mythological material made it into 'The Lord of the Rings.' Much of it did not. He wanted to publish the histories--the Silmarillion saga--alongside the books we all know today, but the publishers turned him down repeatedly. He died without seeing any of that work published, and when his son Christopher tried to make one cohesive text from the massive amounts of material, much of it was bastardized. Only later did Christopher edit and release over a dozen volumes of original texts, showing us a bit more of the scope of the history Tolkien had imagined."

So far he has been giving us his 'Lord of the Rings,' his drama of the minutiae, but in the process he got caught up in the grand and glorious visions of the Targaryens, just as Tolkien was swept up into the glories of the First Age.

In the Starry Sept, the High Septon railed and thundered, calling down the wroth of the gods upon the Targaryens. The archmaesters of the Citadel met in conclave. The men of the City Watch filled sacks with sand and pails with water to fight the fires they knew were coming. Along the city walls, crossbows, scorpions, spitfires, and spear-throwers were hoisted onto the battlements in hopes of bringing down the dragons when they appeared.

I read the Kindle edition when I can, and listen to the professional narration edition while commuting or otherwise enjoying the countryside in what “The People’s Almanac” referred to as ‘The Empty Quarter.” Listening to “Fire & Blood” while cruising through these wind-blown prairies, I found myself speculating that perhaps, just perhaps, when the ancient ones entered these lands several eons ago, they may have slew dragons and brute goliaths to wrestle the Upper Midwest free from some precursors of the human race…THAT is one mark of a good writer of fantasy, the learned one some refer to as George R.

Then he repackaged his short stories Sons of the Dragon,  The Rogue Prince, and The Princess and the Queen and published them in Fire and Blood.  So far 65% of this book is previously published material  I already own.  It's disappointing when an author who is rich and famous beyond his wildest dreams chooses to scam his fans this way.  The only way I recommend you buy this book is if you don't already have the anthologies the stories were previously released in.

The horror initiates in the personalities of the characters. So, in addition to having a good, strong plot you have to have well developed characters. This isn't the case here. The characters act inappropriately (engaging in light banter after horrific events, for example) and their dialogue is unconvincing. One of the main characters (d'Branin,the brain), included the phrase ""my friend"" at least once in every sentence he spoke - kind of maddening after a while.

But from what I have read elsewhere, everyone says that the Vinge story is the first imagining of a virtually embodied cyberspace, as seen not long thereafter in books written by William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and later Tad Williams (among others). It's an important idea, and a tip of the hat for setting the stage, but I struggled with the anachronistic view of technology that Vinge used to describe how the ""Other Plane"" would work. I'll probably read it again, though, because it's not really a fair criticism, particularly because he was trying to do something extremely difficult to do in the late seventies: situate a computationally interconnected world in a near-future that no one could have possibly yet understood."

Martin's story works this way. In contrast to Vinge's hard science story, Martin uses mysticism as a major device. One of the things I love about his stories is the way he situates magic as part of the fabric of the universe. It never feels out of place to me, perhaps because in the worlds he imagines magic never really does anyone any good. I suppose you could say he's a postmodern fantasist, and I've always enjoyed that about him. The one problem I had with Nightflyers was the amount of character development that Martin tried to cram into such a short novella. I found myself constantly flipping back to the page where he introduced the entire cast of characters in one massive dump of details. It felt like he just wanted to get us up to speed on who these people were so we could move forward with the story, but the names and faces are so unfamiliar that it was just too hard to differentiate them without more space and backstory between the introductions. Even still, the novella stuck with me and it was worth the read. But if you're just getting into old Martin sci-fi, and you're not interested in Vinge, you might want to check out Tuf Voyaging."

In fact, 99% of Martin's world seems to be made up of it, with the people living there viewing Westeros as some insignificant backwater. Reading AGoT, I thought that part of the world would just be a jumping-off point for Daenerys. But no, it now has become the virtual main setting of ASOIAF. Why did Martin make that decision? I want to find out what happens in Westeros. Or do I? I'm not sure what the reader is supposed to be focused on because Martin is just all over the place. Toward the end of the book, Dany hallucinates and talks to Jorah Mormont who reiterates that he told her to go to Westeros because Meereen was not where she belonged. I felt as if Martin was mocking us because it's what every frickin' reader would have told her as well. So why did you make us read hundreds of pages about her fretting away in Meereen?!

I know a big appeal of the series are the ""gray"" characterizations, and I agree, but does nearly everyone have to be a murderous sociopath with no regard for human life?

A Feast For Crows began the downslide but I figured it was merely setup. But ADWD was even worse than setup because NOTHING HAPPENS.

When I got to chapters that I knew would be boring (Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, for example), the only thing that got me through it was flipping ahead and seeing that a Reek or Arya chapter was soon to follow. Don't get me wrong, I like Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, but particularly with Dany's story in Meereen, barely ANYTHING happens in the book. It is paced so poorly that I really feel like half of her chapters could've been axed. Also, what is up with the ONE Jaime chapter in which, again, basically nothing happens? Martin ended aFfC with this huge (and kind of lame) cliffhanger with Brienne...and when we finally see her again, we learn absolutely nothing.

She wants to be treated as an equal so she does ruthless things that she believes men would do in her place. Still a bitch though. Jaime, he certainly changes after having his hand cut off and traveling with Brienne in the last book. I kind of felt bad for him, but I think he needed that to happen in order for him to change. Otherwise he’d still be a dick. I like that there was an underlining show of respect (or affection if you really wanted it that way) with Jaime and Brienne. A part of me wants them together lol The book also talked about Arya and Sansa. It was more about their journey of what they go through to end up where they should be in the next book or so.

The horror initiates in the personalities of the characters. So, in addition to having a good, strong plot you have to have well developed characters. This isn't the case here. The characters act inappropriately (engaging in light banter after horrific events, for example) and their dialogue is unconvincing.

It's an important idea, and a tip of the hat for setting the stage, but I struggled with the anachronistic view of technology that Vinge used to describe how the ""Other Plane"" would work.

Martin's story works this way. In contrast to Vinge's hard science story, Martin uses mysticism as a major device. One of the things I love about his stories is the way he situates magic as part of the fabric of the universe. It never feels out of place to me, perhaps because in the worlds he imagines magic never really does anyone any good. I suppose you could say he's a postmodern fantasist, and I've always enjoyed that about him. The one problem I had with Nightflyers was the amount of character development that Martin tried to cram into such a short novella. I found myself constantly flipping back to the page where he introduced the entire cast of characters in one massive dump of details. It felt like he just wanted to get us up to speed on who these people were so we could move forward with the story, but the names and faces are so unfamiliar that it was just too hard to differentiate them without more space and backstory between the introductions.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

My eyes crossed over the endless descriptions of every morsel of food cooked or eaten, along with the emblems/heraldry of even the most minor character.  There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.  That character as portrayed by Peter Dinkwater was so much more complex and interesting.  His charm and wit fit with this handsome actor.  Brienne -- the same.

916,0,0.15541666666666668,"How can Martin write SO many pages yet have so little happen? I mean, if you want to know what a character is eating to break their fast, or what color someone's surcoat or tokar is, or what color the bricks of a city are that day, or that words are wind, then this book will be riveting to you. And are we supposed to care more about Westeros or Essos? Becasue ADWD sure is Essos-centric. In fact, 99% of Martin's world seems to be made up of it, with the people living there viewing Westeros as some insignificant backwater. Reading AGoT, I thought that part of the world would just be a jumping-off point for Daenerys. But no, it now has become the virtual main setting of ASOIAF. Why did Martin make that decision? I want to find out what happens in Westeros. Or do I? I'm not sure what the reader is supposed to be focused on because Martin is just all over the place. Toward the end of the book, Dany hallucinates and talks to Jorah Mormont who reiterates that he told her to go to Westeros because Meereen was not where she belonged. I felt as if Martin was mocking us because it's what every frickin' reader would have told her as well. So why did you make us read hundreds of pages about her fretting away in Meereen?! And, at the end, she seemingly ends ups in the same place she was in AGoT!"

I'm sure some readers do, but do most of us care at all about characters like Asha, Victarion, and Euron? Even Theon/Reek got old by the second half of the book. And honestly, are we supposed to care about what happens to the the billions of people in Meereen like the Brazen Beasts, Stormcrows, Sons of the Harpy, Hizdahr, etc.? Everyone in Meereen, save a couple, are pretty much terrible people and I couldn't care less what their ultimate fate is."

But, my goodness, nothing uplifting at all happens. It's just one gloomy event after another and everyone is either angry, oppressed, or psychotic. Martin goes out of his way to ensure that absolutely nothing remotely pleasant happens. I understand there are books with such tones, but after nearly 5,000 pages of it, you get a bit worn down. I know a big appeal of the series are the ""gray"" characterizations, and I agree, but does nearly everyone have to be a murderous sociopath with no regard for human life? This worked in the first three books because we weren't sure what characters we were going to root for or against. But now, we know who has a shred of decency or not and the incessant melancholy is tiresome."

Usually, I'd just abandon a book I wasn't enjoying, but after reading 4,000 pages of the series I couldn't quit on it. Books 1-3 were fantastic. A Feast For Crows began the downslide but I figured it was merely setup. But ADWD was even worse than setup because NOTHING HAPPENS. I'm really torn over whether I'll read The Winds of Winter if and when it's released. I don't think I have it in me to read another novel like ADWD. I only started this series a few months ago, so I read all these books back-to-back (excluding the one I read three-quarters of the way through ADWD to keep my sanity), so I saw the decline of storytelling with this series happen in real time."

The word painting is incredible, he is able to transport readers in to his world, and he leaves you desperately wanting more.  I still have not seen one single episode, but I have seen far more of this world than any viewer has.  Great book.  Now, that being said, I am livid that the story simply STOPS, leaving every single character and situation hanging in limbo.  There is no resolution for anyone or anything.  Oh, please, Mr. Martin, finish this series before I am forced to contaminate my perceptions by finally watching the show (which I know does not follow the book exactly, and geez, how does your mind pictures compare to the commercial pictures?).  Fortunately, or not, my daughters and I spend a lot of time discussing what they are seeing versus what I am reading, and I at least have some idea where my beloved Tyrion goes.

Martin's world is so dark and his characters so despicable that nothing worthy can endure. Tolkien wrote about a quest, Martin writes about --what? -- who cares?"

I found myself skimming several parts (especially the Reek/Theon parts) because they were so iterative and slow moving.  The quantity of characters is so vast that one loses interest in some of them.  The first book was amazing and the first 3 together were very, very enjoyable.  I'm disappointed in the last two and frustrated that we have what started out as a fascinating journey turn into ""a maze of twisty passages, all alike"" (for those of you who remember the old Adventure game).  You have to read the book, if you've read all the others, but it definitely doesn't stand alone."
941,0,0.29120370370370374,"As a fan of the aSoIaF series, I have to say, I understand why the series has come under scrutiny post-Storm of Swords. After that book, which was the best in the series (well-plotted, fast moving, just overall awesome), a Feast for Crows was released, which showed a noticeable slowing down of things. I believe George RR Martin, while still being able to write beautifully and create whole characters, has lost his ability of pacing the story well. Ultimately, A Dance with Dragons, like aFfC, suffers the same problems, but this time even more so than its predecessor."
942,0,0.0,"At least in aFfC, things were kicking into high-gear in the last 150 pages or so. A Dance with Dragons only became exciting to me in the last chapter and the epilogue. The first three books were filled with exciting moments placed throughout the story--that's why they call them 'page-turners'. Getting through this book at times was a struggle. When I got to chapters that I knew would be boring (Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, for example), the only thing that got me through it was flipping ahead and seeing that a Reek or Arya chapter was soon to follow. Don't get me wrong, I like Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, but particularly with Dany's story in Meereen, barely ANYTHING happens in the book. It is paced so poorly that I really feel like half of her chapters could've been axed. Also, what is up with the ONE Jaime chapter in which, again, basically nothing happens? Martin ended aFfC with this huge (and kind of lame) cliffhanger with Brienne...and when we finally see her again, we learn absolutely nothing. We're just left with another cliffhanger, this one just lamer than the last."

He seems like a menacing guy, and I can't wait to see how he ties into the main plot concerning Dany."

That Martin was at least partially inspired by actual historical events and settings for his novels is well known, and this book explores the aspect of chivalry in the stories in depth by drawing comparisons to historical sources.  In chapters on concepts such as ‘loyalty’, ‘vengeance’ and ‘prowess’, Professor Jamison examines how they are depicted in the stories is comparison to their historical depiction.  Given the gritty realism of the novels and TV show, it’s no surprise that many of the noble and knightly characters are compromised in light of the chivalric ideals of both Westeros and the European world of the Middle Ages."

For many readers (including this reviewer), their primary (if not only) experience of the saga will be via the TV show and this helps make the work more relevant to a broader audience.  Most assuredly, this is a scholarly work and, while certainly engagingly written, reads as such, which may diminish its appeal to some readers who may wish a more accessible and less rigorous book.  However a reader with knowledge of and interest in chivalry, both historical and fictional, will be rewarded by going along with Jamison's exploration."

No matter how terrifying the White Walkers from beyond The Wall might be, it's still the unexpected betrayal from human allies which will probably cut the deepest. I often run games at conventions, and the Night's Watch setting is particularly useful for running that sort of one-shot adventure; it's much harder to get deeply into stories of political intrigue in a single session with players who may be unfamiliar with the works of George R.R.

Some of Tolkien's mythological material made it into 'The Lord of the Rings.' Much of it did not. He wanted to publish the histories--the Silmarillion saga--alongside the books we all know today, but the publishers turned him down repeatedly. He died without seeing any of that work published, and when his son Christopher tried to make one cohesive text from the massive amounts of material, much of it was bastardized.

So far he has been giving us his 'Lord of the Rings,' his drama of the minutiae, but in the process he got caught up in the grand and glorious visions of the Targaryens, just as Tolkien was swept up into the glories of the First Age.

Then he repackaged his short stories Sons of the Dragon,  The Rogue Prince, and The Princess and the Queen and published them in Fire and Blood.  So far 65% of this book is previously published material  I already own.  It's disappointing when an author who is rich and famous beyond his wildest dreams chooses to scam his fans this way.  The only way I recommend you buy this book is if you don't already have the anthologies the stories were previously released in.  That way you have all the stories collected in one volume without having to buy his cash grab, useless anthologies for a 75 page GOT story."

This  fantasy ""sword and sorcery"" collection contains a range of stories, so of course some will appeal to some people and others to other people, but by and large this ""sword and sorcery"" collection fell flat to me. Holland, Parker, Liu, and Cherryh wrote fairly good tales, so if you are a big fan of one of these authors you might want to look at this book. Martin's own short story was a weak, dry telling of past Westeros history.

Instead of 6 core abilities and a multitude of related skills, GR combines these concepts and sets up 19 abilities. An average score is 2, but could range up to 7. There are no classes in GR, but rather the player assigns experience points to abilities or specialties to form the character as he sees fit, rather than getting a lump package of improvements per level."

If the total rolled on the test dice meet or beat the difficulty the character succeeds. The use of skills, combat, and even intrigue are all handled using this same concept."
1068,0,0.10476190476190476,"In D&D there was nothing half so frustrating as having a huge attack roll only to follow up with minimal damage. That situation is mitigated with the GR system. The greater your attack roll, the more damage inflicted."
1069,0,0.04629629629629631,"With so few abilities in D&D it was easy to buff up one or two to really excel at combat. This isn't an issue in the GR system. In combat the difficulty of your attack is your opponent's Combat Defense (similar to AC). This is basically number derived from various abilities (Agility + Awareness + Athletics). That means multiple abilities become important to avoid getting hit besides just one (as with Dexterity in D&D). Testing the Fighting ability is typically used for melee combat, but damage is usually dependant of Athletics (rather than both relying on Strength as in D&D)."
1070,0,0.0988095238095238,"The players have much more control over what happens to their characters in combat. D&D would have some situations where characters could get killed quite easily before their player could react. GR introduces injuries and wounds to give more control back to the player. While characters have relatively low Health scores (hit points), whenever they receive damage the player decides to accept the damage or take an injury to lower the damage sustain a small amount, but then suffer a small penalty for the injury until healed. Additionally, players could choose to take a wound to remove all damage sustained from the attack, but then suffer a much larger penalty. Also, wounds can take a long time to heal. If a character is reduced to zero Health the person who defeated them chooses their fate (unconsciousness, maiming, or most commonly death). Basically, the staving off of instant death gives much more opportunity for retreat or surrender rather than death."

It was written by a maester for King Robert Baratheon, and you'll notice the language becomes very flowery when his reign is mentioned.  Some topics mentioned did not make it into the TV show until at least a year or two after the book was published.  It offers a detailed account of events of the past deeds of Tywin Lannister, and you kinda see why he was like he was.  The front and back covers are padded and feel very high-quality.  The artwork all throughout this book is nothing short of amazing.  It's worth the price just for that if you don't feel like reading it.  There are pictures on almost every page, but it may still take awhile to read due to small type and double-column format.  Also included is a Targaryen family tree, which is more complicated and has more branches than you would expect.  It becomes very hard to keep up with the ones of that family who are mentioned in the historical narrative because SO MANY of the Targaryens have the same names.

Some of the narratives are very well done - the ""short story"" of the Conquest, the reign of King Jaehaerys, and the history of the Vale in particular stood out as well done; the narrative flowed well, and the characterizations were very satisfying, but most importantly gave itself identity and value.  As far as a common identifier of the best pieces, the text is at its best and finds a nice rhythm when it becomes character-centric as opposed to purely event-centric.  When Martin et. immerse you in the rich characterizations of Nymeria, Aegon, Robar Royce, and Tywin, and let the history flow around them is extremely enjoyable."

It is understandable in areas where it's obvious that Martin isn't ready to show his cards; others such as the War of the Ninepenny Kings from a 10,000 foot view and the Greyjoy Rebellion being reduced to a couple paragraphs and passing on the opportunity to add color and depth as opposed to regurgitation due to necessity were a letdown."

I'm not sold that AWOIAF will be a frequent reread or that the table of contents and index reference enough consistency in the text for it to serve as a reference, but there will definitely be portions worth a bookmark and others worth perusing at times, and the art is worth a complete page through anytime."

If I wrote a book I would show my publisher this book and say, “I want my book to have the high-quality feel of this cover and the paper”. Definitely something best appreciated by the serious ASOIAF fan. It’s not a novel written from the first person perspective like the series. It’s a history book that’s supposed to be written by a Maester living after the events of Roberts Rebellion. It starts in the ancient world of the Dawn Age, covers the Children of the Forest, the migration of the First Men to Westeros, the arrival of the Andals, the Doom of Valyria, and a lot more. You get some good information on the uniting of the 7 Kingdoms by Aegon I “The Conquerer” and his sister queens Visenya and Rhenyra that Arya recounts to Tywin Lannister when reserving as his cupbearer in the HBO series. Since it’s written more around the events than many of the people, some readers may find it dry like history book, but that’s essentially what it is. Overall a beautiful object worth the money for those who wonder about the world of GoT/ASOIAF."

As a result, there is very little information that has not already been included in the Song of Fire and Ice.

This series is highly addicting, and I'm incredibly late reviewing this because it's impossible to stop reading after finishing a book to compose a review.  Also, the second and third book sort of run together, which makes it difficult to review them separately.  This is the perfect follow up to the first book - carries the momentum from the events introduced there and sets up its own story.

Instead, I'll supply a very brief overview.  With Robert Baratheon dead and the legitimacy of his children brought into question, the Iron Throne is up for grabs and Westeros is plunged into civil war as (at least) four different people claim the Throne as theirs.  Meanwhile, the Night's Watch in the North begins to investigate the people beyond the Wall, the Wildlings.

1131,0,0.2287719298245614,"Martin sure knows how to tell a riveting story.  I've read a fair bit of fantasy over the years and eventually had to take a break from the genre due to becoming bored with seeing the same clichés and tropes used over and over again.  As I read ""Clash of Kings,"" I found myself waiting to see the book fall into the same pattern of predictability that I've seen elsewhere.  The first book was great in being unique and unpredictable, but could Martin really maintain that high standard throughout a second book?  The joke's on me because he definitely can...and I've learned better than to doubt his originality.  There isn't much in the way of resolution in this book, but that's ok since there are several more books that follow it.  Instead, ""Clash of Kings"" serves to propel the ideas established in the first book.  We see how events from ""Game of Thrones"" have unfolded and developed into something bigger and more widespread, and what we see is fascinating.  It's also worth mentioning that there are a lot of big players in this war, but Martin manages to make all of them distinct.  None are just thrown in to be there and all of them are fleshed out.  This isn't a generic world filled with the normal trappings of the genre - Martin's Westeros is unique and fully realized.  Reading about the different factions alone would be compelling...combine it with an intriguing plot and you've got one Hell of a good read!"
1132,0,-0.09083333333333334,"It should also be noted that Martin pulls no punches when describing his dark, gritty world.  If you're squeamish and prefer to read about characters that blush when thinking about kissing or battles that are over and done with relatively quickly and cleanly, this probably isn't your book.  The big theme in ""Clash of Kings"" is the huge, ongoing civil war that has erupted across the entirety of Westeros, and no detail is spared.  The full horrors of the battlefield - bones being crushed, flesh split, the gruesome results of someone being turned into a bloody pulp via being bludgeoned by a blunt object, soldiers being trampled by their own horses, pretty much any awful battle-related thing you can come up with - are portrayed in graphic detail.  These fights aren't glorious; they're long, agonizing, and brutal, and Martin writes them so well that you'll find yourself on the battlefield alongside the characters (for better or worse, in some cases).  He's done his research on the tools and tactics of the medieval period, and it definitely shows.  He also doesn't hesitate to show us the other not-so-pleasant aspects of humanity.  Sex (whether consensual or the spoils of war) is a common occurrence and it isn't portrayed in a nice, chaste manner.  Like many other things in the books, it's blunt, realistic, and often uncomfortable...both for the characters and the reader.  The people who populate Martin's world drink, curse, and entertain lewd, violent, or otherwise nasty thoughts.  Sanitation is what you'd expect it to be in a war torn, medieval country.  These things often aren't fun to read about, but they add a level of authenticity to the novel, and I personally find it refreshing to read an author who doesn't sugarcoat the realities of armed conflict.  The details characterize the world and the people in it - if you read ""Clash of Kings"" and think ""Wow, this person/event/place is awful!"" then you're probably thinking what Martin intended with this characterization.  Westeros is not a fun place to be, and Martin's attention to the dark, gritty, unpleasant details bring that into sharp focus."
1133,0,0.07966666666666666," Much like with ""Game of Thrones,"" this book has several main characters with the point of view changing in each chapter.  This continues to work well by providing different viewpoints of big events without becoming repetitive and tiresome.  More importantly, it showcases Martin's talent for creating dynamic, three-dimensional, complex, fully realized characters.  I've read a lot of novels lately that have been in first person point of view, but have ultimately failed to capture the essence of the character or put the reader in the protagonist's head.  ""Clash of Kings,"" though written in third person, doesn't have this problem.  Each character's viewpoint is distinctly different with the characters' biases and backgrounds moving prominently to the forefront.  Even better, with the figures' biases colouring events, you'll often wonder whose version of events is the correct version or if any of them are truly accurate.  It makes of an interesting, unique reading experience, especially with the big events that unfold in this book."
1134,0,0.10354497354497355,"It's also worth mentioning that although there are certain characters who are clearly protagonists and antagonists, whether or not you like them will be largely dependent on how you react to their characterization, not what their role in the story is.  Since starting ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" I've noticed that everyone seems to like and dislike different characters - and what one person may like about a certain character may cause another person to dislike them.  I think this demonstrates how realistic Martin has made his characterization.  It's a lot like reading about an actual person: very few people are simply classified as good or bad - instead, they have numerous aspects to their personalities that resonate well with some people and act as turn-offs to others.  The characters in this book are much the same...and with many of them doing or being witness to darker, nastier things in the second novel, there are plenty of opportunities for your opinions on certain characters to change."
1135,0,0.14921536796536797,"On a random, character-related note, I'm pleased to see that Martin actually has a wide array of female characters.  I'll be honest and say that the stereotypical female tropes that pop up in the fantasy genre bug the Hell out of me: women tend to be either delicate damsels or kickass warriors, neither of which has ever struck me as particularly interesting or realistic.  In ""Clash of Kings,"" we're treated both to some of our favourite women from the first book as well as new heroines.  There are no stereotypes here and each character embodies her own strengths and flaws.  Sure, there are women who fall in line with the traditional gender roles of a medieval wife and those who prefer a more warrior-esque life (as well as many who lie somewhere in between), but they're so wonderfully characterized that they never become predictably stereotypical, nor are they overlooked in favour of the male characters.  A lot of authors could learn something from Martin: it's possible to write a varied female cast without them becoming stereotypes.  Furthermore, it never feels like a character is included to provide ""another female perspective"" (or another male perspective, for that matter) - they all matter and they all provide valuable insight into Westeros, the war, and their unique situations."
1136,0,0.17247023809523807,"While there isn't a ""main character"" per se, if I had to pick a point of view character that features most prominently, it would definitely be Tyrion.  This is his book: how he rises to the lofty position of the King's Hand and how he uses his intellect and cunning to overcome his lack of physical prowess in a book that's largely about battles, knights, and their consequences.  While Tyrion isn't my favourite character, his perspective is always interesting since he has to go about things in a vastly different way than the book's other figures.  If you're a fan of Tyrion, this is your book!"

And you are probably wondering about Daenerys. Well, she stuck out too, though not as much as her newly-hatched dragons. Even before I watch the second season, I understood the whole ""Where are my dragons?!"" thing. I would laugh if I knew how. And let us not forget Davos, the right-hand man of Stannis Baratheon.

It’s wonderfully constructed.  The covers are padded and the pages are sewn to the book’s spine.

I was particularly interested in the legends the Maester mentions again and again only to dismiss them as a learned man is taught to do.  Anyone who has either read R. R.

It was written by a maester for King Robert Baratheon, and you'll notice the language becomes very flowery when his reign is mentioned.  Some topics mentioned did not make it into the TV show until at least a year or two after the book was published.  It offers a detailed account of events of the past deeds of Tywin Lannister, and you kinda see why he was like he was.  The front and back covers are padded and feel very high-quality.  The artwork all throughout this book is nothing short of amazing.  It's worth the price just for that if you don't feel like reading it.  There are pictures on almost every page, but it may still take awhile to read due to small type and double-column format.  Also included is a Targaryen family tree, which is more complicated and has more branches than you would expect.  It becomes very hard to keep up with the ones of that family who are mentioned in the historical narrative because SO MANY of the Targaryens have the same names.  For those of us who have yet to read the Game of Thrones books, this one is a great read.  Very informative and well worth your time."

Some of the narratives are very well done - the ""short story"" of the Conquest, the reign of King Jaehaerys, and the history of the Vale in particular stood out as well done; the narrative flowed well, and the characterizations were very satisfying, but most importantly gave itself identity and value.  As far as a common identifier of the best pieces, the text is at its best and finds a nice rhythm when it becomes character-centric as opposed to purely event-centric.

It is understandable in areas where it's obvious that Martin isn't ready to show his cards; others such as the War of the Ninepenny Kings from a 10,000 foot view and the Greyjoy Rebellion being reduced to a couple paragraphs and passing on the opportunity to add color and depth as opposed to regurgitation due to necessity were a letdown."

I will say this is a striking object, with a plush, leathery cover that I don’t find on many modern books. The paper quality is first class and the illustrations are magnificent.  If I wrote a book I would show my publisher this book and say, “I want my book to have the high-quality feel of this cover and the paper”. Definitely something best appreciated by the serious ASOIAF fan. It’s not a novel written from the first person perspective like the series. It’s a history book that’s supposed to be written by a Maester living after the events of Roberts Rebellion. It starts in the ancient world of the Dawn Age, covers the Children of the Forest, the migration of the First Men to Westeros, the arrival of the Andals, the Doom of Valyria, and a lot more. You get some good information on the uniting of the 7 Kingdoms by Aegon I “The Conquerer” and his sister queens Visenya and Rhenyra that Arya recounts to Tywin Lannister when reserving as his cupbearer in the HBO series. Since it’s written more around the events than many of the people, some readers may find it dry like history book, but that’s essentially what it is. Overall a beautiful object worth the money for those who wonder about the world of GoT/ASOIAF."

Remember Frankenstein? But moreover, any genre can support horror. Think of the great horror stories in classic literature - Turn of the Screw, for one. The horror initiates in the personalities of the characters. So, in addition to having a good, strong plot you have to have well developed characters. This isn't the case here. The characters act inappropriately (engaging in light banter after horrific events, for example) and their dialogue is unconvincing. One of the main characters (d'Branin,the brain), included the phrase ""my friend"" at least once in every sentence he spoke - kind of maddening after a while.

It's an important idea, and a tip of the hat for setting the stage, but I struggled with the anachronistic view of technology that Vinge used to describe how the ""Other Plane"" would work. I'll probably read it again, though, because it's not really a fair criticism, particularly because he was trying to do something extremely difficult to do in the late seventies: situate a computationally interconnected world in a near-future that no one could have possibly yet understood."

Martin's story works this way. In contrast to Vinge's hard science story, Martin uses mysticism as a major device. One of the things I love about his stories is the way he situates magic as part of the fabric of the universe. It never feels out of place to me, perhaps because in the worlds he imagines magic never really does anyone any good. I suppose you could say he's a postmodern fantasist, and I've always enjoyed that about him. The one problem I had with Nightflyers was the amount of character development that Martin tried to cram into such a short novella. I found myself constantly flipping back to the page where he introduced the entire cast of characters in one massive dump of details. It felt like he just wanted to get us up to speed on who these people were so we could move forward with the story, but the names and faces are so unfamiliar that it was just too hard to differentiate them without more space and backstory between the introductions. Even still, the novella stuck with me and it was worth the read. But if you're just getting into old Martin sci-fi, and you're not interested in Vinge, you might want to check out Tuf Voyaging."

He wanted to publish the histories--the Silmarillion saga--alongside the books we all know today, but the publishers turned him down repeatedly. He died without seeing any of that work published, and when his son Christopher tried to make one cohesive text from the massive amounts of material, much of it was bastardized.

1238,0,0.31428571428571433,"I enjoyed this fiction that felt like a true history. I confess that I enjoyed the Audible edition a bit more than the Kindle edition, but, for me, that is becoming the case with most reading. I read the Kindle edition when I can, and listen to the professional narration edition while commuting or otherwise enjoying the countryside in what “The People’s Almanac” referred to as ‘The Empty Quarter.” Listening to “Fire & Blood” while cruising through these wind-blown prairies, I found myself speculating that perhaps, just perhaps, when the ancient ones entered these lands several eons ago, they may have slew dragons and brute goliaths to wrestle the Upper Midwest free from some precursors of the human race…THAT is one mark of a good writer of fantasy, the learned one some refer to as George R. R. Martin."
1239,0,0.11428571428571427,"The one downside of this epic history is that this book is only the first volume and the author himself admits that he has other pressing epics to bring forth before he can get around to writing the conclusion. In that sense, this book ends without being complete. An annoyance to me and, I’m certain, many other readers."

That was an outright lie.  So far with just a cursory inspection Aegon's Conquest was word for word copied and pasted from The World of Ice and Fire.  Then he repackaged his short stories Sons of the Dragon,  The Rogue Prince, and The Princess and the Queen and published them in Fire and Blood.  So far 65% of this book is previously published material  I already own.  It's disappointing when an author who is rich and famous beyond his wildest dreams chooses to scam his fans this way.  The only way I recommend you buy this book is if you don't already have the anthologies the stories were previously released in.  That way you have all the stories collected in one volume without having to buy his cash grab, useless anthologies for a 75 page GOT story."
1246,0,0.05416666666666666,"Was hoping for something more like Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, or something with story and contributes more toward the overall world of Westeros. Instead it reads more like a history book: bland, boring, lifeless prose. Actually, I've read many history books that are way better than this. There are no interesting characters here, no real redeeming qualities or characters. This is a poor excuse for mindless fluff. The artwork is good, but that's about it."

My patience has been rewarded with a scholarly work that connects the old-old with the new-old, and does so in compelling fashion.  Those who have read Martin's works or viewed the HBO adaptation might well be taken aback at what they didn't see or fully appreciate the first time around. Armed with the insights offered by Jamison, they will critically reconsider what they have seen and marvel at the historical and literary riches that almost certainly eluded them initially."

1249,0,0.06000000000000001,"This slim, but very informative, volume explores the connections between the medieval mores, behaviors and thinking of George RR Martin’s fictional setting in both the “Song of Ice and Fire” novels and the HBO “Game of Thrones” based on those books and the historical and literary “real” world.  That Martin was at least partially inspired by actual historical events and settings for his novels is well known, and this book explores the aspect of chivalry in the stories in depth by drawing comparisons to historical sources.  In chapters on concepts such as ‘loyalty’, ‘vengeance’ and ‘prowess’, Professor Jamison examines how they are depicted in the stories is comparison to their historical depiction.  Given the gritty realism of the novels and TV show, it’s no surprise that many of the noble and knightly characters are compromised in light of the chivalric ideals of both Westeros and the European world of the Middle Ages."
1250,0,0.3038888888888888,"Astutely, Jamison bases her analysis on both Martin’s novels and the popular HBO series.  For many readers (including this reviewer), their primary (if not only) experience of the saga will be via the TV show and this helps make the work more relevant to a broader audience.  Most assuredly, this is a scholarly work and, while certainly engagingly written, reads as such, which may diminish its appeal to some readers who may wish a more accessible and less rigorous book.  However a reader with knowledge of and interest in chivalry, both historical and fictional, will be rewarded by going along with Jamison's exploration."

Likewise, there's no point in bringing more attention to the novels because they're already some of the most famous in fantasy. It's pretty much the same with the spin-offs as there's not much point in talking about Game of Thrones since everyone and their brother is watching that show."
1253,0,0.0625,"  I've made an exception for Telltale's Game of Thrones because that's a side-story but this is the first book I feel comfortable recommending which might have slipped under fans' radars. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a compilation of three novellas (The Hedge Knight, The Sworn Sword, and The Mystery Knight) written by George R.R. Martin for various anthologies."
1254,0,0.06166666666666667,"  The premise is a young hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall (a self-granted title since his master never knighted him), takes on a squire named Egg after the death of his mentor Ser Arlan. A hedge knight is a knight with no prestige or lineage but has the training as well as equipment to be a mounted soldier in the Seven Kingdoms. At the absolute bottom of the social hierarchy's warrior class but still part of it, Duncan has a unique perspective on events occurring in the century before A Game of Thrones."
1255,0,0.14774410774410773,"  The three novellas take place in a very different Westeros from the one described in the books because the Targaryens are still at, if not the height of the rule then some distance from their twilight. The lands have been at peace for a decade and the nobility, if not following the example of chivalry in spirit, is at least trying to follow the example of chivalry in appearance. In a very real way, the book serves as an argument for a Targaryen Restoration because it shows everyone more or less getting along and the peasants able to live reasonably secure lives."
1256,0,0.1492647058823529,"  George R.R. Martin, the father of grimdark, still treats the Medieval romance with a good deal of disdain but it's not nearly as cynical in many respects. Ser Duncan's basic decency makes him a far better knight than those born into the role but the absence of Gregor Cleganes, Boltons, Bloody Mummers, and even Lannisters make the villains of a decidedly more sympathetic bent. They're still very realistic fantasy with only the occasional prophetic dream keeping it from being absent magic together but the heart of the stories is a peasant-born warrior trying to navigate the complicated social dynamics of Westeros' knightly class."
1257,0,0.104,"  The Hedge Knight is, in a weird way, not that dissimilar from Heath Ledger's A Knight's Tale. Duncan is a peasant knight from Fleabottom who has a vision of becoming a famous warrior after Ser Arlan's death. Unfortunately, Ser Duncan lacks William Thatcher's godlike skill with a lance and swiftly finds himself in hot water with a Targaryen prince. In a very real way, this is a sports story and the deadly stakes of the event make it all the more entertaining to read about. Of the three, The Hedge Knight is my least favorite as I never really found that much interest in jousting and its central role in peacetime Medieval life."
1258,0,0.030000000000000006,"  The Sworn Sword is a follow up to The Hedge Knight where Duncan has managed to find himself as an actual proper sworn knight to a lord--sort of. Having taken up service to a lord of something which barely qualifies as a tower, Duncan ends up caught up in a conflict between his lord and the beautiful widow across the river. The central conflict turns out to be not one of good and evil but the legacy of a war which had, to quote George Lucas, heroes on both sides. I like how it managed to take a very Medieval concept of fighting for a ladies' honor and play it straight while also illustrating how absurd it was."
1259,0,0.275,"  The Mystery Knight is, bluntly, one of my favorite stories in fantasy. I've re-read this novella five times and am probably going to do so again. It's a story with a lot of parallels to Bonnie Prince Charlie's revolt and is basically a Medieval spy novel set against the backdrop of a tournament. I love the characters of Lord Butterwell, the Fiddler, and Fireball's bastard. They are eccentric, larger than life, and yet believable. I also loved finally getting a chance to meet"
1260,0,0.4673611111111111,"  These stories are,obviously, going to be enjoyed more by fans of the books than by the show. Aside from the possible relationship between Duncan and Brienne, many of the details of the history will fly by television viewers. Despite this, I think they would be enjoyable even to those who have no experience with the world. Fans of grimdark will find the stories a good deal more idealistic and pleasant but still possessed of the moral ambiguity as well as ""realism"" which made the original books so enjoyable."
1261,0,0.145,"  The chief draw of the books for me is the relationship between Ser Duncan and Egg. Duncan is, to be honest, dumb but decent while Egg is highly-intelligent and somewhat more ruthless than his master. The contrast between their social positions, viewpoints, and attitudes provides an endless array of interesting conversations. It's kind of sad I know how their story works out due to The World of Ice and Fire but their tale is one I could follow through its own series. They're hilarious, insightful, and fun together--and what more can you ask from your heroes?"
1262,0,0.37857142857142856,"  In conclusion, I really really recommend this book. I almost wish George R.R. Martin would take more time from The Winds of Winter to do more of these stories. They're fun, light, and entertaining reads which deserve to be looked into. This version of the story is illustrated and while I tend to prefer the comic book versions of these story, it lends a sort of ""Illustrated King Arthur"" feel to things."

Taking place a century before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire, the story follows Ser Duncan, a man who was recently knighted before his master passed away. While traveling to a tourney, he meets a bald boy named Egg who, despite Duncan's efforts to have it otherwise, becomes his squire. Duncan learns some surprising things while at the tourney, but ends up making a name for himself in front of the Targaryans, who are the family of kings and queens in Westeros. Afterwards, he and Egg have several adventures, including trying to help a disgraced lord save his lands and his smallfolk (peasants) from a drought while a rival house is taking all the resources, and participating in a tourney while looking for a performer that is hinted that Duncan might have feelings for. Underneath it all is the threat of the embers of a rebellion that had been beaten years ago, but is struggling to rise to power again. Will Duncan and Egg be able to help the Seven Kingdoms?"

Martin has promised more in this storyline, but my hope is he expands the plot to novel-length rather than giving us a book of three or four short stories. One thing readers may appreciate in this book, over the ASOIAF series, is that there is less tragedy and, since the lives of our two heroes are already ""written"" as it were, the reader does not have to worry about them dying in a bloody mess (at least not until they are much, much older). There is also notably no sex in these stories, and very little profanity. While not written for a young audience, the book is different from his other novels in that respect."

Westeros has always to me felt like our world with slight changes. It doesn't take much to imagine it clearly, as Martin paints it so vividly.

We are treated to some juicy Westeros history in this one, as we follow Dunk during his time as Ser Eustace Osgrey's sworn sword; a knight whose house, previously of renown and good standing, is down on its luck. Ser Eustace and his men fought in the Blackfyre Rebellion, which is an intensely interesting portion of ASOIAF history, and I was pleased to hear more about it through his recollections. Bloodraven is also a frequent topic of discussion, as he is the King's Hand during the time of this story, and that was interesting to hear."

Where GoT and the other books are ponderous and turgid, and disgusting with rancid descriptions of poo and blood and death, The Dunk & Egg Show is instead charming. I get the feeling that George R.R.

1300,0,-0.04246794871794871,"""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is a little different from most other fantasy roleplaying games. Player characters don't spend their time and energies looting ancient tombs-- at least, not in a typical campaign. This isn't a game about fighting orcs or kobolds to reclaim ancient dwarven treasure. This setting is about playing the Game of Thrones-- and when you play the Game of Thrones, you win or die; there is no middle ground. In this context, ""playing the Game of Thrones"" means advancing the interests of your characters' houses, being continuously wary of betrayal by other houses, and engaging in that sort of skulduggery or courtly intrigue yourself. Physical combat is often incidental to these larger plots and machinations. Everyone is a potential ally-- or a potential betrayer. And that means that to GM this game, you need an entire world full of other houses to interact with-- allies, enemies, friends, neighbors, and so forth. The need to create and populate these other houses puts an incredible burden on Game Masters, and while the "

This means that if your player characters' house is located in the Riverlands, it's incredibly easy to integrate each family presented here into your own game-- and even if your players decide to locate their house in another region, it should also be possible to relocate at least one or two of these houses to that area with minimal or no effort. Each of these minor houses has its own history and defining characteristics, with game stats for all of its major family members and householders. The Chronicle Starter also offers guidance on how each of these houses might interact with each other, as well as with the Great Houses, and even provides suggestions for 'muddying the palate' so that each of these families might not be exactly what they appear to be from the outside."

There are 1000 characters, and you sometimes get a little lost on who belongs to you, but it doesn't distract from the story.  Even though he writes about a fictional world, he doesn't make up words just to make them up.  He makes those 1000 pages fly by."

All that said, once you get your mind wrapped around the characters, the books are phenomenal. It's not an easy read, no - but it's well worth the effort.

This series is highly addicting, and I'm incredibly late reviewing this because it's impossible to stop reading after finishing a book to compose a review.  Also, the second and third book sort of run together, which makes it difficult to review them separately.  This is the perfect follow up to the first book - carries the momentum from the events introduced there and sets up its own story.  It somehow manages to be darker and grittier than the first installment without stepping into the realm of being gratuitous .  In fact, it's probably one of the best second novels I've read.

Instead, I'll supply a very brief overview.  With Robert Baratheon dead and the legitimacy of his children brought into question, the Iron Throne is up for grabs and Westeros is plunged into civil war as (at least) four different people claim the Throne as theirs.  Meanwhile, the Night's Watch in the North begins to investigate the people beyond the Wall, the Wildlings.  In the East, Daenerys Targaryen moves forward with her plan to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for herself.  Her following has dwindled after the death of her husband, but her three newborn dragons make her notorious.

1333,0,0.2287719298245614,"Martin sure knows how to tell a riveting story.  I've read a fair bit of fantasy over the years and eventually had to take a break from the genre due to becoming bored with seeing the same clichés and tropes used over and over again.  As I read ""Clash of Kings,"" I found myself waiting to see the book fall into the same pattern of predictability that I've seen elsewhere.  The first book was great in being unique and unpredictable, but could Martin really maintain that high standard throughout a second book?  The joke's on me because he definitely can...and I've learned better than to doubt his originality.  There isn't much in the way of resolution in this book, but that's ok since there are several more books that follow it.  Instead, ""Clash of Kings"" serves to propel the ideas established in the first book.  We see how events from ""Game of Thrones"" have unfolded and developed into something bigger and more widespread, and what we see is fascinating.  It's also worth mentioning that there are a lot of big players in this war, but Martin manages to make all of them distinct.  None are just thrown in to be there and all of them are fleshed out.  This isn't a generic world filled with the normal trappings of the genre - Martin's Westeros is unique and fully realized.  Reading about the different factions alone would be compelling...combine it with an intriguing plot and you've got one Hell of a good read!"
1334,0,-0.09083333333333334,"It should also be noted that Martin pulls no punches when describing his dark, gritty world.  If you're squeamish and prefer to read about characters that blush when thinking about kissing or battles that are over and done with relatively quickly and cleanly, this probably isn't your book.  The big theme in ""Clash of Kings"" is the huge, ongoing civil war that has erupted across the entirety of Westeros, and no detail is spared.  The full horrors of the battlefield - bones being crushed, flesh split, the gruesome results of someone being turned into a bloody pulp via being bludgeoned by a blunt object, soldiers being trampled by their own horses, pretty much any awful battle-related thing you can come up with - are portrayed in graphic detail.  These fights aren't glorious; they're long, agonizing, and brutal, and Martin writes them so well that you'll find yourself on the battlefield alongside the characters (for better or worse, in some cases).  He's done his research on the tools and tactics of the medieval period, and it definitely shows.  He also doesn't hesitate to show us the other not-so-pleasant aspects of humanity.  Sex (whether consensual or the spoils of war) is a common occurrence and it isn't portrayed in a nice, chaste manner.  Like many other things in the books, it's blunt, realistic, and often uncomfortable...both for the characters and the reader.  The people who populate Martin's world drink, curse, and entertain lewd, violent, or otherwise nasty thoughts.  Sanitation is what you'd expect it to be in a war torn, medieval country.  These things often aren't fun to read about, but they add a level of authenticity to the novel, and I personally find it refreshing to read an author who doesn't sugarcoat the realities of armed conflict.  The details characterize the world and the people in it - if you read ""Clash of Kings"" and think ""Wow, this person/event/place is awful!"" then you're probably thinking what Martin intended with this characterization.  Westeros is not a fun place to be, and Martin's attention to the dark, gritty, unpleasant details bring that into sharp focus."
1335,0,0.07966666666666666," Much like with ""Game of Thrones,"" this book has several main characters with the point of view changing in each chapter.  This continues to work well by providing different viewpoints of big events without becoming repetitive and tiresome.  More importantly, it showcases Martin's talent for creating dynamic, three-dimensional, complex, fully realized characters.  I've read a lot of novels lately that have been in first person point of view, but have ultimately failed to capture the essence of the character or put the reader in the protagonist's head.  ""Clash of Kings,"" though written in third person, doesn't have this problem.  Each character's viewpoint is distinctly different with the characters' biases and backgrounds moving prominently to the forefront.  Even better, with the figures' biases colouring events, you'll often wonder whose version of events is the correct version or if any of them are truly accurate.  It makes of an interesting, unique reading experience, especially with the big events that unfold in this book."
1336,0,0.10354497354497355,"It's also worth mentioning that although there are certain characters who are clearly protagonists and antagonists, whether or not you like them will be largely dependent on how you react to their characterization, not what their role in the story is.  Since starting ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" I've noticed that everyone seems to like and dislike different characters - and what one person may like about a certain character may cause another person to dislike them.  I think this demonstrates how realistic Martin has made his characterization.  It's a lot like reading about an actual person: very few people are simply classified as good or bad - instead, they have numerous aspects to their personalities that resonate well with some people and act as turn-offs to others.  The characters in this book are much the same...and with many of them doing or being witness to darker, nastier things in the second novel, there are plenty of opportunities for your opinions on certain characters to change."
1337,0,0.14921536796536797,"On a random, character-related note, I'm pleased to see that Martin actually has a wide array of female characters.  I'll be honest and say that the stereotypical female tropes that pop up in the fantasy genre bug the Hell out of me: women tend to be either delicate damsels or kickass warriors, neither of which has ever struck me as particularly interesting or realistic.  In ""Clash of Kings,"" we're treated both to some of our favourite women from the first book as well as new heroines.  There are no stereotypes here and each character embodies her own strengths and flaws.  Sure, there are women who fall in line with the traditional gender roles of a medieval wife and those who prefer a more warrior-esque life (as well as many who lie somewhere in between), but they're so wonderfully characterized that they never become predictably stereotypical, nor are they overlooked in favour of the male characters.  A lot of authors could learn something from Martin: it's possible to write a varied female cast without them becoming stereotypes.  Furthermore, it never feels like a character is included to provide ""another female perspective"" (or another male perspective, for that matter) - they all matter and they all provide valuable insight into Westeros, the war, and their unique situations."
1338,0,0.17247023809523807,"While there isn't a ""main character"" per se, if I had to pick a point of view character that features most prominently, it would definitely be Tyrion.  This is his book: how he rises to the lofty position of the King's Hand and how he uses his intellect and cunning to overcome his lack of physical prowess in a book that's largely about battles, knights, and their consequences.  While Tyrion isn't my favourite character, his perspective is always interesting since he has to go about things in a vastly different way than the book's other figures.  If you're a fan of Tyrion, this is your book!"

And you are probably wondering about Daenerys. Well, she stuck out too, though not as much as her newly-hatched dragons.

And as time moves forward in the story you experience those characters exult in victory, seethe with hatred, quail in defeat, rage in frustrated schemes, and hope against hope.  Not only that - but they grow with their experiences.  Their motivations can at times be complex scheming or simple earthy passion (whether that be angry violence or lust or daydreaming).

This is a sophisticated story that has such content in its proper place and not gratuitously.  There is fighting but it's not center piece as a simpleton's hack and slash hero-save-princess-defeat-demonprince novel.  Nor is this series meager on action.  There is plenty - yes there's fighting, but there's also violence, there's action-y physical feats, there's sex.  Sometimes it can be raw brutality, exposing the crueler and despicable side found in humanity (torture, rape, etc).

1354,0,0.20833333333333331,"It wouldn't be possible to adequately sum up everything that happens in this book in an appropriately succinct manner, so I'll just give a brief, bare-bones overview.  Westeros is still caught up in the war raging for the Iron Throne.  With five claimants competing to rule the Seven Kingdoms, it doesn't look like there's an end in sight for the violence and destruction.  Things are also brewing in the North, where the Wildlings beyond are organizing an attack to break through the Wall, overwhelm the severely undermanned Night's Watch, and invade.  Meanwhile, in the East, Daenerys continues to amass resources to aid in her plans to attack for the Throne.  She moves through the cities of Slaver's Bay, gaining support and exercising her growing authority as both the Khaleesi and the Mother of Dragons."
1355,0,0.11557017543859649,"I'll start by addressing perhaps the most obvious characteristic of ""A Storm of Swords:"" it's huge.  Granted, if you downloaded it for your Kindle like I did, the monstrous size of the novel might not be as immediately striking, but you'll undoubtedly notice pretty quickly that it's over a thousand pages long.  Books this long tend to be one of two things: unnecessarily descriptive with plenty of filler to pad out the pages or complex with an intricately layered story that fills the pages with content.  I'm pleased to say that this book is definitely the latter of the two possibilities.  It would perhaps be feared that the middle book of a lengthy series, especially one with a humongous page count, would be repetitive and full of fluff and padding, serving only to lengthen the series and sell more books.  Again, that simply isn't the case with ""A Storm of Swords.""  The plot doesn't stall at all; in fact, every chapter moves the story forward and works to develop the overall plot.  The story is exciting with so many power players devising and implementing their own schemes as well as the war raging over the Iron Throne.  Martin has a lot to say about his world, which makes for a fascinating story and guarantees that none of the thousand-and-some-odd pages are boring.  With the pace being consistent throughout the novel, you'll be flipping through pages with the desperate need to know what happens next to your favourite character or faction.  For the first time I can recall, I finished a thousand plus page novel thinking that it wasn't long enough!  Martin's story is so enthralling, unique, and captivating that you'll want more than even a book this long can offer."
1356,0,0.08014705882352943,"I'll also note that the story is far from predictable.  I've mostly given up trying to guess what will happen because the actual events typically far exceed my predictions.  I'll probably end up mentioning this in every ""Song of Ice and Fire"" review, but I ended up taking a bit of a break from fantasy due to being frustrated with the same plots and tired clichés that seemed to crop up in every book.  Martin has actually managed to write not only a unique fantasy novel, but a series that stands above many others simply because he strays from the commonly tread path.  Pretty much anything can happen to anyone; good characters aren't given immunity and bad characters aren't doomed to death (and really, calling characters good and bad isn't completely accurate since most are various shades of grey).  The plot twists and turns like crazy, but it's handled deftly and the author clearly knows where he's going, putting the reader an exciting ride and a gamut of emotions.  And just when you think you've got it figured out, something comes up that throws your predictions out the window.  It's a nice change from being able to guess everything before it happens, as tends to be the case with other books in the genre."
1357,0,0.06456521739130436,"It's well established by this point that Martin doesn't shy away from the violence of war...and ""A Storm of Swords"" practically has blood dripping from its pages.  With the war for the Iron Throne in full swing, the death count in this book is high.  The horrors of battle are portrayed in all their gritty glory; these aren't nice people and they don't do nice things.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, neither the violence nor the sex present comes off as gratuitous (for the most part), but instead works to flesh out Martin's world and reinforce the concept that no one is safe.  Yes, this is the book with the Red Wedding.  There are a couple weddings that take place, so it's not immediately obvious which one will be THE wedding if you haven't already been informed.  And yes, some well-loved characters meet their end in this bloodbath, families betray one another, alliances change...all the jazz that one can expect from such an event.  There are also other grisly surprises that determine the fate of some, well, not as well-loved characters.  In the East, Daenerys is faced with the brutality of slavery and the effects of anarchy as she conquers the Slave Cities, and it's not pretty.  If you were bothered by the dark content of the two previous books, you probably shouldn't read this one because the author has really upped his game in that aspect.  Personally, I'm of the opinion that the grittiness adds authenticity to the world, but I've always preferred a darker, more realistic setting."
1358,0,-0.05122549019607842,"While I usually don't find the sex and violence in these books to be gratuitous, there is one instance of it that I'll have to complain about; and weirdly enough, it's probably one of the more ""normal"" sexual relationships we see in the book: Jon and Ygritte.  I totally get the significance of Jon breaking his vows with Ygritte, both in terms of his background as a bastard and as a member of the Night's Watch, and I enjoyed seeing him struggle with his conflicting emotions on the matter.  However, I got a little tired of reading about them getting it on in detail multiple times every night.  Sure, a few times is fine to give us an idea of Jon's situation, but the frequency came off as really unnecessary.  Of all the gruesome things one could complain about in this novels, that's what stuck out to me as being gratuitous and over the top...who'd have thought?"
1359,0,0.08431677018633542,"The characters just get better and better with each book.  That's not to say they necessarily become better people (in the brutal world of Westeros, that almost never seems to happen), but they definitely grow and become more intriguing with each installment.  With so many storylines and characters, it would be easy to shove a couple off to the side, but, again, Martin seems to have this under control and every character is more than adequately fleshed out.  The changing point of view in each chapter works well because it ensures that every story and every character continues to move forward.  Each chapter, and therefore each point of view, is in some way significant; I never finished a chapter wondering what the point of it was or what it added to the story.  The characters continue to be portrayed in shades of grey, each one unique and changing and none of them fall into the typical archetypes.  You'll be frustrated with some and cheer on others and, as I mentioned earlier, some well-loved characters (and some that we love to hate) meet their ends in ""A Storm of Swords.""  You never know what the characters are going to throw at you (or at each other, as the case often is) or who's going to make it out alive...and in a book as brutal as this one, that certainly adds a level of suspense and excitement."

Jaime is an incredibly nuanced character and begins to undergo a lot of change in this novel, and much like Tyrion, he walks the line between protagonist and antagonist, never really being one or the other.  With his background and unique perspective, I hope we see Jaime as a point of view character (and, indeed, that he survives whatever the next books throw at him) in future books."

As I've mentioned in my other reviews, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is so great partially because different characters will resonate differently with each reader, so your favourite character may be someone else's least favourite.  As I was reading this book, I found that the character that tended to make me groan aloud when I started a chapter and saw his name was Bran.  That's not to say he's a poorly written character; he just doesn't really appeal to me.  Perhaps it's because there are so many other plot lines to focus on, but I found him and his story to be a tad boring.  I don't doubt that he and his quest will be significant since he's one of the few characters that encounters magic (a rarity in this world), but his position as the wise, future-seeing, up-and-coming mage just doesn't interest me personally."

It takes the themes and plots from the first two books and builds upon them to create a novel that is better, darker, and more intriguing than the first two.  The plot is still steadily moving forward, building momentum and adding layers of story with each book.  With the cast being as massive as it is and the number of storylines being many, I find myself wondering how Martin will tie everything together.  He's proven to be a capable writer so far, so I'm sure he'll figure it out.  At any rate, this monstrous book is one Hell of a good read.  Five stars!"

Super engaging plots, music, interior and exterior settings, color, characters, suspense, eroticism and everything else are top of the heap.  I've bought entire seasons and watched 2-3 episodes a night.  Can't begin to recommend it highly enough.  I can't believe that  Season 8 isn't going to be aired until next year.  When I heard it was going to be aired this summer I got freaked out wondering how I could wait an entire year without seeing a new season.  Recently learned that it won't come out until next year (2019) and that it will only have 6 episodes.  What an immense bummer.  But I'm sure it will be more than worth it.

The production values are outstanding for a TV series.  I also like that it realistically presents the moral choices facing those who lead and those who seek to honor their sometimes conflicting obligations to family, oath and tribes.

This was particularly helpful for skipping the lengthy intro (an awesome work in itself really, but after seeing it several times I preferred to skip it) by skipping that chapter (the entire chapter was the intro).

1422,0,0.18392857142857144,"To begin, understand that ""A Dance with Dragons"" is the 5th book in the series. There is much confusion about this book release. In the U.K., publishers divided the book into two parts to make it easier to read due to the length of the book. In the U.S., most of the publishers released it as one book. So, when you see Part 1 and Part 2, these are not different books with different information. You can read it all in one book, or read parts 1 and 2 and get the same story. That being said, also make sure to read the page from the author regarding the chronology of the book. Basically, this book is written to back-fill information and stories from book 4, ""A Feast for Crows."" And Martin explains this at the beginning of the book. If you read this book without first understanding the chronology, you may be lost. I have really loved this fantasy world and I cannot wait until this Fall when the 6th book, ""The Winds of Winter"" is supposed to be released. Martin is not sure when the series will end and how many books will be written to complete the story. I've heard anywhere from 6-8 books may comprise the series.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong."

There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.  That character as portrayed by Peter Dinkwater was so much more complex and interesting.  His charm and wit fit with this handsome actor.  Brienne -- the same.

I mean, if you want to know what a character is eating to break their fast, or what color someone's surcoat or tokar is, or what color the bricks of a city are that day, or that words are wind, then this book will be riveting to you. And are we supposed to care more about Westeros or Essos? Becasue ADWD sure is Essos-centric. In fact, 99% of Martin's world seems to be made up of it, with the people living there viewing Westeros as some insignificant backwater. Reading AGoT, I thought that part of the world would just be a jumping-off point for Daenerys. But no, it now has become the virtual main setting of ASOIAF. Why did Martin make that decision? I want to find out what happens in Westeros. Or do I? I'm not sure what the reader is supposed to be focused on because Martin is just all over the place. Toward the end of the book, Dany hallucinates and talks to Jorah Mormont who reiterates that he told her to go to Westeros because Meereen was not where she belonged. I felt as if Martin was mocking us because it's what every frickin' reader would have told her as well. So why did you make us read hundreds of pages about her fretting away in Meereen?!

I'm sure some readers do, but do most of us care at all about characters like Asha, Victarion, and Euron? Even Theon/Reek got old by the second half of the book. And honestly, are we supposed to care about what happens to the the billions of people in Meereen like the Brazen Beasts, Stormcrows, Sons of the Harpy, Hizdahr, etc.? Everyone in Meereen, save a couple, are pretty much terrible people and I couldn't care less what their ultimate fate is."

But, my goodness, nothing uplifting at all happens. It's just one gloomy event after another and everyone is either angry, oppressed, or psychotic. Martin goes out of his way to ensure that absolutely nothing remotely pleasant happens. I understand there are books with such tones, but after nearly 5,000 pages of it, you get a bit worn down. I know a big appeal of the series are the ""gray"" characterizations, and I agree, but does nearly everyone have to be a murderous sociopath with no regard for human life? This worked in the first three books because we weren't sure what characters we were going to root for or against.

A Feast For Crows began the downslide but I figured it was merely setup. But ADWD was even worse than setup because NOTHING HAPPENS. I'm really torn over whether I'll read The Winds of Winter if and when it's released. I don't think I have it in me to read another novel like ADWD. I only started this series a few months ago, so I read all these books back-to-back (excluding the one I read three-quarters of the way through ADWD to keep my sanity), so I saw the decline of storytelling with this series happen in real time."

The word painting is incredible, he is able to transport readers in to his world, and he leaves you desperately wanting more.  I still have not seen one single episode, but I have seen far more of this world than any viewer has.  Great book.  Now, that being said, I am livid that the story simply STOPS, leaving every single character and situation hanging in limbo.  There is no resolution for anyone or anything.  Oh, please, Mr. Martin, finish this series before I am forced to contaminate my perceptions by finally watching the show (which I know does not follow the book exactly, and geez, how does your mind pictures compare to the commercial pictures?).  Fortunately, or not, my daughters and I spend a lot of time discussing what they are seeing versus what I am reading, and I at least have some idea where my beloved Tyrion goes.

After that book, which was the best in the series (well-plotted, fast moving, just overall awesome), a Feast for Crows was released, which showed a noticeable slowing down of things. I believe George RR Martin, while still being able to write beautifully and create whole characters, has lost his ability of pacing the story well. Ultimately, A Dance with Dragons, like aFfC, suffers the same problems, but this time even more so than its predecessor."
1505,0,0.0,"At least in aFfC, things were kicking into high-gear in the last 150 pages or so. A Dance with Dragons only became exciting to me in the last chapter and the epilogue. The first three books were filled with exciting moments placed throughout the story--that's why they call them 'page-turners'. Getting through this book at times was a struggle. When I got to chapters that I knew would be boring (Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, for example), the only thing that got me through it was flipping ahead and seeing that a Reek or Arya chapter was soon to follow. Don't get me wrong, I like Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, but particularly with Dany's story in Meereen, barely ANYTHING happens in the book. It is paced so poorly that I really feel like half of her chapters could've been axed. Also, what is up with the ONE Jaime chapter in which, again, basically nothing happens? Martin ended aFfC with this huge (and kind of lame) cliffhanger with Brienne...and when we finally see her again, we learn absolutely nothing. We're just left with another cliffhanger, this one just lamer than the last."

You have a vast range of personalities, motivations, biases, vices, scheming, hurts, etc.  You watch upon a stage where the marionette has directed their interplay so intricately it is a believable plotline that echoes real life as action and schemes between characters collide.  And as time moves forward in the story you experience those characters exult in victory, seethe with hatred, quail in defeat, rage in frustrated schemes, and hope against hope.  Not only that - but they grow with their experiences.  Their motivations can at times be complex scheming or simple earthy passion (whether that be angry violence or lust or daydreaming).

The machinations of each character in this vast stage - competing and colliding with one another's - and that ends up speaking for itself.  The reader may cheer or curse depending on a particular turn of events, but that has more to do with the efforts of one party or another succeeding against all others.  It's a dose of near-reality.

This is a sophisticated story that has such content in its proper place and not gratuitously.  There is fighting but it's not center piece as a simpleton's hack and slash hero-save-princess-defeat-demonprince novel.  Nor is this series meager on action.  There is plenty - yes there's fighting, but there's also violence, there's action-y physical feats, there's sex.  Sometimes it can be raw brutality, exposing the crueler and despicable side found in humanity (torture, rape, etc).

The protagonists (assumedly so because of their nobler aspirations) don't necessarily win.  Plenty of characters whom the reader may come to empathize with may be frustrated (even killed).

1543,0,0.20833333333333331,"It wouldn't be possible to adequately sum up everything that happens in this book in an appropriately succinct manner, so I'll just give a brief, bare-bones overview.  Westeros is still caught up in the war raging for the Iron Throne.  With five claimants competing to rule the Seven Kingdoms, it doesn't look like there's an end in sight for the violence and destruction.  Things are also brewing in the North, where the Wildlings beyond are organizing an attack to break through the Wall, overwhelm the severely undermanned Night's Watch, and invade.  Meanwhile, in the East, Daenerys continues to amass resources to aid in her plans to attack for the Throne.  She moves through the cities of Slaver's Bay, gaining support and exercising her growing authority as both the Khaleesi and the Mother of Dragons."
1544,0,0.11557017543859649,"I'll start by addressing perhaps the most obvious characteristic of ""A Storm of Swords:"" it's huge.  Granted, if you downloaded it for your Kindle like I did, the monstrous size of the novel might not be as immediately striking, but you'll undoubtedly notice pretty quickly that it's over a thousand pages long.  Books this long tend to be one of two things: unnecessarily descriptive with plenty of filler to pad out the pages or complex with an intricately layered story that fills the pages with content.  I'm pleased to say that this book is definitely the latter of the two possibilities.  It would perhaps be feared that the middle book of a lengthy series, especially one with a humongous page count, would be repetitive and full of fluff and padding, serving only to lengthen the series and sell more books.  Again, that simply isn't the case with ""A Storm of Swords.""  The plot doesn't stall at all; in fact, every chapter moves the story forward and works to develop the overall plot.  The story is exciting with so many power players devising and implementing their own schemes as well as the war raging over the Iron Throne.  Martin has a lot to say about his world, which makes for a fascinating story and guarantees that none of the thousand-and-some-odd pages are boring.  With the pace being consistent throughout the novel, you'll be flipping through pages with the desperate need to know what happens next to your favourite character or faction.  For the first time I can recall, I finished a thousand plus page novel thinking that it wasn't long enough!  Martin's story is so enthralling, unique, and captivating that you'll want more than even a book this long can offer."
1545,0,0.08014705882352943,"I'll also note that the story is far from predictable.  I've mostly given up trying to guess what will happen because the actual events typically far exceed my predictions.  I'll probably end up mentioning this in every ""Song of Ice and Fire"" review, but I ended up taking a bit of a break from fantasy due to being frustrated with the same plots and tired clichés that seemed to crop up in every book.  Martin has actually managed to write not only a unique fantasy novel, but a series that stands above many others simply because he strays from the commonly tread path.  Pretty much anything can happen to anyone; good characters aren't given immunity and bad characters aren't doomed to death (and really, calling characters good and bad isn't completely accurate since most are various shades of grey).  The plot twists and turns like crazy, but it's handled deftly and the author clearly knows where he's going, putting the reader an exciting ride and a gamut of emotions.  And just when you think you've got it figured out, something comes up that throws your predictions out the window.  It's a nice change from being able to guess everything before it happens, as tends to be the case with other books in the genre."
1546,0,0.06456521739130436,"It's well established by this point that Martin doesn't shy away from the violence of war...and ""A Storm of Swords"" practically has blood dripping from its pages.  With the war for the Iron Throne in full swing, the death count in this book is high.  The horrors of battle are portrayed in all their gritty glory; these aren't nice people and they don't do nice things.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, neither the violence nor the sex present comes off as gratuitous (for the most part), but instead works to flesh out Martin's world and reinforce the concept that no one is safe.  Yes, this is the book with the Red Wedding.  There are a couple weddings that take place, so it's not immediately obvious which one will be THE wedding if you haven't already been informed.  And yes, some well-loved characters meet their end in this bloodbath, families betray one another, alliances change...all the jazz that one can expect from such an event.  There are also other grisly surprises that determine the fate of some, well, not as well-loved characters.  In the East, Daenerys is faced with the brutality of slavery and the effects of anarchy as she conquers the Slave Cities, and it's not pretty.  If you were bothered by the dark content of the two previous books, you probably shouldn't read this one because the author has really upped his game in that aspect.  Personally, I'm of the opinion that the grittiness adds authenticity to the world, but I've always preferred a darker, more realistic setting."
1547,0,-0.05122549019607842,"While I usually don't find the sex and violence in these books to be gratuitous, there is one instance of it that I'll have to complain about; and weirdly enough, it's probably one of the more ""normal"" sexual relationships we see in the book: Jon and Ygritte.  I totally get the significance of Jon breaking his vows with Ygritte, both in terms of his background as a bastard and as a member of the Night's Watch, and I enjoyed seeing him struggle with his conflicting emotions on the matter.  However, I got a little tired of reading about them getting it on in detail multiple times every night.  Sure, a few times is fine to give us an idea of Jon's situation, but the frequency came off as really unnecessary.  Of all the gruesome things one could complain about in this novels, that's what stuck out to me as being gratuitous and over the top...who'd have thought?"
1548,0,0.08431677018633542,"The characters just get better and better with each book.  That's not to say they necessarily become better people (in the brutal world of Westeros, that almost never seems to happen), but they definitely grow and become more intriguing with each installment.  With so many storylines and characters, it would be easy to shove a couple off to the side, but, again, Martin seems to have this under control and every character is more than adequately fleshed out.  The changing point of view in each chapter works well because it ensures that every story and every character continues to move forward.  Each chapter, and therefore each point of view, is in some way significant; I never finished a chapter wondering what the point of it was or what it added to the story.  The characters continue to be portrayed in shades of grey, each one unique and changing and none of them fall into the typical archetypes.  You'll be frustrated with some and cheer on others and, as I mentioned earlier, some well-loved characters (and some that we love to hate) meet their ends in ""A Storm of Swords.""  You never know what the characters are going to throw at you (or at each other, as the case often is) or who's going to make it out alive...and in a book as brutal as this one, that certainly adds a level of suspense and excitement."
1549,0,0.14393939393939392,"""A Storm of Swords"" adds Jaime as a point of view character, and he quickly became one of my personal favourites, especially with Tyrion's viewpoint also being maintained throughout the book to provide a different Lannister perspective.  Jaime is an incredibly nuanced character and begins to undergo a lot of change in this novel, and much like Tyrion, he walks the line between protagonist and antagonist, never really being one or the other.  With his background and unique perspective, I hope we see Jaime as a point of view character (and, indeed, that he survives whatever the next books throw at him) in future books."
1550,0,-0.048750000000000036,"This is also the book where certain characters began to stand out to me as being just plain annoying and, surprisingly, boring.  As I've mentioned in my other reviews, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is so great partially because different characters will resonate differently with each reader, so your favourite character may be someone else's least favourite.  As I was reading this book, I found that the character that tended to make me groan aloud when I started a chapter and saw his name was Bran.  That's not to say he's a poorly written character; he just doesn't really appeal to me.  Perhaps it's because there are so many other plot lines to focus on, but I found him and his story to be a tad boring.  I don't doubt that he and his quest will be significant since he's one of the few characters that encounters magic (a rarity in this world), but his position as the wise, future-seeing, up-and-coming mage just doesn't interest me personally."

It takes the themes and plots from the first two books and builds upon them to create a novel that is better, darker, and more intriguing than the first two.  The plot is still steadily moving forward, building momentum and adding layers of story with each book.  With the cast being as massive as it is and the number of storylines being many, I find myself wondering how Martin will tie everything together.  He's proven to be a capable writer so far, so I'm sure he'll figure it out.  At any rate, this monstrous book is one Hell of a good read.  Five stars!"

I've followed this series since the beginning and I've always been the one drooling over the delicious food I see them eating. I made Crusty White Bread and Medieval Creme Bastard from The Wall, Honeyed Chicken from The North, and Lemonsweet from Dorne. The bread held it's shape and was fairly easy to make. It says to knead it but if you are using a mixer, be careful not to over mix it or it will end up being dense. It was crunchy on the outside and oooo so soft on the inside. If you hold it up, it makes the crunching sound when you push on it. The chicken was delicious. I was wary of the apple cider vinegar because it made the sauce smell quite strong but it was delicious. Don't be fooled by the vinegar smell. YUM! For dessert, creme bastard was delicious. The cream was not overly sweet and the burst of the frozen blueberries made for a happy plate from me and my guest. Lastly, the Lemonsweet took some elbow grease from juicing. The fresh taste of this beverage is everything. I will admit, it is very sweet. If you don't care for overly sweet drinks, this might not be for you but for me...I was in heaven. This entire dinner put me in the spirit for GoT Season 7 Episode 2. I would recommend this book to any GoT lover. It will not disappoint you!"

The pie is fantastically photogenic, and I changed the filling to a chicken pot pie for round two with equally popular results.

Now I know not everyone is a Game of Thrones fan, and I've even tried to not dismiss the non-fans from my life, but this is a hard one. While George R.R. Martin throws in a lot of food descriptions and moments at the table, he's not exactly giving ingredient lists or techniques (we're talking the books here, not the TV series). The authors don't let that stop them, and have managed to delve into what amounts to medieval English cooking and modern English cooking, and find a strangely satisfying balance. They speculate on classic dishes that come close to fitting the descriptions of what Martin meanders on about, try it out, present it, photograph it (beautifully I might add), and then in many of the cases, turn around and come up with a modern take on the same dish or ingredients, and do the same. The one drawback, in some ways, is the subject matter - though it may be my own failing, I don't think there was a single recipe that enticed me to try making it - it felt like the kind of food one might make for a dinner party of fans of either the books or TV series, but probably for little other reason."

If you are considering the leather bound set, you do need to pay attention to the measurements and take a look at the customer images and reviews before you make a decision.

Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show.

There were several points I thought made the TV show much more engaging -- first and foremost, the casting.  Throughout the books, Tyrion is described as deformed and ugly, yet lusty.

What is “sword and sorcery”? The genre that consists of stories with swords and magic and kingdoms set in an alternative-kind-of-medieval land. That’s pretty much all that the stories of this collection have in common. The book does a terrific job representing the wide variety of styles and types of tales that can be told in that genre.

This  fantasy ""sword and sorcery"" collection contains a range of stories, so of course some will appeal to some people and others to other people, but by and large this ""sword and sorcery"" collection fell flat to me. Holland, Parker, Liu, and Cherryh wrote fairly good tales, so if you are a big fan of one of these authors you might want to look at this book. Martin's own short story was a weak, dry telling of past Westeros history. Where Martin excels is in making complex characters live and suffer and become real to the reader, but his recent short story work just seems to sound like dry history of an imaginary place."

Now I am not sure if this is something wrong with my copy specifically or for every copy, but that is what I received so that is what i am going to review.

I first noticed this on page 140 at the beginning of Catelyn's chapter.  There is a picture of Summer mauling the man with the knife.  This scene does not occur until page 145.  It would have been stronger to have this picture on page 146.  This happens again and again.  Maybe not a huge deal if you have already read the series but I would have greatly preferred it if the publisher had cared enough to figure out the best location for each picture within the story.  A first time reader should definitely steer clear.  Also, it may have looked nicer if the images did not fill the entire page edge to edge with no margins or decorative border, but that is just a stylistic choice."

Yes, the forward actually goes out of its way to spoil three moments in the book, perhaps under the ridiculous assumption that you've already seen the HBO TV series and excusing them as ""being easy to see coming"" and ""foreshadowing"".

This problem could very easily be solved by only placing illustrations at the end of chapters (showing events that have happened or are happening at the chapter close) or by placing all of the illustrations at the end of the book. Placing them at the beginning of the chapter (with some near the end of certain key chapters) only serves to spoil the upcoming events.

I thought there were plenty of illustrations, though some are placed in odd locations within the story content, but my two main quibbles are 1) the sticker on the back and 2) the red title band that wraps around the cover. The sticker is removable but of course leaves a residue behind - for those who don't know, after carefully removing the sticker and any paper bits left behind, use a very small amount (nickel-size) of olive oil on a paper towel and wipe over the residue using a little pressure to remove the residue. Then use another paper towel very slightly damp and wipe off the remaining olive oil. Wiping in small circles with a little bit of pressure works best. You can probably get some kind of cleaner for this but I was worried anything like that might damage the cover. Olive oil does the job with no damage, just don't get it inside the book!"

I've found myself hardly able to bear moving to each successive chapter to follow a separate storyline or character due to the gripping story in the one I was reading.  But as I switched gears to the next ""nugget"" in this grandly woven tale, I found myself equally enthralled by THAT storyline."

You have a vast range of personalities, motivations, biases, vices, scheming, hurts, etc.  You watch upon a stage where the marionette has directed their interplay so intricately it is a believable plotline that echoes real life as action and schemes between characters collide.  And as time moves forward in the story you experience those characters exult in victory, seethe with hatred, quail in defeat, rage in frustrated schemes, and hope against hope.  Not only that - but they grow with their experiences.  Their motivations can at times be complex scheming or simple earthy passion (whether that be angry violence or lust or daydreaming).  The stage is set with a great cast as well - both men and women each with their subtleties and unique persona.  Not every woman is a damsel, just as not every man is a hero - which is fantastic."

The machinations of each character in this vast stage - competing and colliding with one another's - and that ends up speaking for itself.  The reader may cheer or curse depending on a particular turn of events, but that has more to do with the efforts of one party or another succeeding against all others.  It's a dose of near-reality.  Plans win and fail - and there isn't an overarching ""blessed"" subset of characters.  It is extremely refreshing and entirely spellbinding."

There are strange creatures and powers, yes.  But this isn't your summer 80s Schwarzenegger/Stallone action flick.  This is a sophisticated story that has such content in its proper place and not gratuitously.  There is fighting but it's not center piece as a simpleton's hack and slash hero-save-princess-defeat-demonprince novel.  Nor is this series meager on action.  There is plenty - yes there's fighting, but there's also violence, there's action-y physical feats, there's sex.  Sometimes it can be raw brutality, exposing the crueler and despicable side found in humanity (torture, rape, etc).  GRRM doesn't have wizards bouncing around making things blow up like ""Tim the Enchanter"" nor do we have some wondrous creature at every turn.

The protagonists (assumedly so because of their nobler aspirations) don't necessarily win.  Plenty of characters whom the reader may come to empathize with may be frustrated (even killed).

1740,0,0.20833333333333331,"It wouldn't be possible to adequately sum up everything that happens in this book in an appropriately succinct manner, so I'll just give a brief, bare-bones overview.  Westeros is still caught up in the war raging for the Iron Throne.  With five claimants competing to rule the Seven Kingdoms, it doesn't look like there's an end in sight for the violence and destruction.  Things are also brewing in the North, where the Wildlings beyond are organizing an attack to break through the Wall, overwhelm the severely undermanned Night's Watch, and invade.  Meanwhile, in the East, Daenerys continues to amass resources to aid in her plans to attack for the Throne.  She moves through the cities of Slaver's Bay, gaining support and exercising her growing authority as both the Khaleesi and the Mother of Dragons."
1741,0,0.11557017543859649,"I'll start by addressing perhaps the most obvious characteristic of ""A Storm of Swords:"" it's huge.  Granted, if you downloaded it for your Kindle like I did, the monstrous size of the novel might not be as immediately striking, but you'll undoubtedly notice pretty quickly that it's over a thousand pages long.  Books this long tend to be one of two things: unnecessarily descriptive with plenty of filler to pad out the pages or complex with an intricately layered story that fills the pages with content.  I'm pleased to say that this book is definitely the latter of the two possibilities.  It would perhaps be feared that the middle book of a lengthy series, especially one with a humongous page count, would be repetitive and full of fluff and padding, serving only to lengthen the series and sell more books.  Again, that simply isn't the case with ""A Storm of Swords.""  The plot doesn't stall at all; in fact, every chapter moves the story forward and works to develop the overall plot.  The story is exciting with so many power players devising and implementing their own schemes as well as the war raging over the Iron Throne.  Martin has a lot to say about his world, which makes for a fascinating story and guarantees that none of the thousand-and-some-odd pages are boring.  With the pace being consistent throughout the novel, you'll be flipping through pages with the desperate need to know what happens next to your favourite character or faction.  For the first time I can recall, I finished a thousand plus page novel thinking that it wasn't long enough!  Martin's story is so enthralling, unique, and captivating that you'll want more than even a book this long can offer."
1742,0,0.08014705882352943,"I'll also note that the story is far from predictable.  I've mostly given up trying to guess what will happen because the actual events typically far exceed my predictions.  I'll probably end up mentioning this in every ""Song of Ice and Fire"" review, but I ended up taking a bit of a break from fantasy due to being frustrated with the same plots and tired clichés that seemed to crop up in every book.  Martin has actually managed to write not only a unique fantasy novel, but a series that stands above many others simply because he strays from the commonly tread path.  Pretty much anything can happen to anyone; good characters aren't given immunity and bad characters aren't doomed to death (and really, calling characters good and bad isn't completely accurate since most are various shades of grey).  The plot twists and turns like crazy, but it's handled deftly and the author clearly knows where he's going, putting the reader an exciting ride and a gamut of emotions.  And just when you think you've got it figured out, something comes up that throws your predictions out the window.  It's a nice change from being able to guess everything before it happens, as tends to be the case with other books in the genre."
1743,0,0.06456521739130436,"It's well established by this point that Martin doesn't shy away from the violence of war...and ""A Storm of Swords"" practically has blood dripping from its pages.  With the war for the Iron Throne in full swing, the death count in this book is high.  The horrors of battle are portrayed in all their gritty glory; these aren't nice people and they don't do nice things.  As I've mentioned in other reviews, neither the violence nor the sex present comes off as gratuitous (for the most part), but instead works to flesh out Martin's world and reinforce the concept that no one is safe.  Yes, this is the book with the Red Wedding.  There are a couple weddings that take place, so it's not immediately obvious which one will be THE wedding if you haven't already been informed.  And yes, some well-loved characters meet their end in this bloodbath, families betray one another, alliances change...all the jazz that one can expect from such an event.  There are also other grisly surprises that determine the fate of some, well, not as well-loved characters.  In the East, Daenerys is faced with the brutality of slavery and the effects of anarchy as she conquers the Slave Cities, and it's not pretty.  If you were bothered by the dark content of the two previous books, you probably shouldn't read this one because the author has really upped his game in that aspect.  Personally, I'm of the opinion that the grittiness adds authenticity to the world, but I've always preferred a darker, more realistic setting."
1744,0,-0.05122549019607842,"While I usually don't find the sex and violence in these books to be gratuitous, there is one instance of it that I'll have to complain about; and weirdly enough, it's probably one of the more ""normal"" sexual relationships we see in the book: Jon and Ygritte.  I totally get the significance of Jon breaking his vows with Ygritte, both in terms of his background as a bastard and as a member of the Night's Watch, and I enjoyed seeing him struggle with his conflicting emotions on the matter.  However, I got a little tired of reading about them getting it on in detail multiple times every night.  Sure, a few times is fine to give us an idea of Jon's situation, but the frequency came off as really unnecessary.  Of all the gruesome things one could complain about in this novels, that's what stuck out to me as being gratuitous and over the top...who'd have thought?"

That's not to say they necessarily become better people (in the brutal world of Westeros, that almost never seems to happen), but they definitely grow and become more intriguing with each installment.  With so many storylines and characters, it would be easy to shove a couple off to the side, but, again, Martin seems to have this under control and every character is more than adequately fleshed out.  The changing point of view in each chapter works well because it ensures that every story and every character continues to move forward.  Each chapter, and therefore each point of view, is in some way significant; I never finished a chapter wondering what the point of it was or what it added to the story.  The characters continue to be portrayed in shades of grey, each one unique and changing and none of them fall into the typical archetypes.  You'll be frustrated with some and cheer on others and, as I mentioned earlier, some well-loved characters (and some that we love to hate) meet their ends in ""A Storm of Swords.""  You never know what the characters are going to throw at you (or at each other, as the case often is) or who's going to make it out alive...and in a book as brutal as this one, that certainly adds a level of suspense and excitement."

Jaime is an incredibly nuanced character and begins to undergo a lot of change in this novel, and much like Tyrion, he walks the line between protagonist and antagonist, never really being one or the other.  With his background and unique perspective, I hope we see Jaime as a point of view character (and, indeed, that he survives whatever the next books throw at him) in future books."

As I've mentioned in my other reviews, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is so great partially because different characters will resonate differently with each reader, so your favourite character may be someone else's least favourite.  As I was reading this book, I found that the character that tended to make me groan aloud when I started a chapter and saw his name was Bran.  That's not to say he's a poorly written character; he just doesn't really appeal to me.  Perhaps it's because there are so many other plot lines to focus on, but I found him and his story to be a tad boring.  I don't doubt that he and his quest will be significant since he's one of the few characters that encounters magic (a rarity in this world), but his position as the wise, future-seeing, up-and-coming mage just doesn't interest me personally."

The plot is still steadily moving forward, building momentum and adding layers of story with each book.  With the cast being as massive as it is and the number of storylines being many, I find myself wondering how Martin will tie everything together.

The paper is wonderful quality but you DON'T take paper like this and fold it, 5 times, and stack them on top of each other, put cheap bands around the corners (which are too loose and accomplish nothing but putting more pressure points on the maps' edges), and plop 'em in a cardboard book.

Westeros shows us the main stage of the stories in better detail.  Beyond the Wall explains itself.

Plus until now there were no city maps detailing specific streets and giving you an idea of scale and distance between one event and another.  This set solves all of that!  I LOVE it.  The maps are easy to read and very well illustrated.  I could have used a bit more detail in terms of landmarks (Example: Catelyn and Robb stop at the grave/statue of a fallen king that's so old no one knows exactly which King it is.  It's not on here.  Plankytown, where Quentyn Martell started his journey to Mereen, is not on here.  Essos looks very empty.) but I am pretty satisfied with what is here.  I was also thrilled to see so many parts of his world that were never mentioned in the books, even once!  By studying these maps you learn new things and new places, lands that his characters are highly unlikely to visit but which sound horrible and fascinating and wonderful on their own!  Please please pretty please George, can you write a short story or graphic novel that takes place in The City of the Winged Men???  Also, the Amazon price is excellent for what's here."
1852,0,0.14749373433583965,"I removed a star for several reasons.  1) People who have written reviews complaining about how the maps will degrade over time because of how they're folded are right.  Small white lines and tears are already forming, and as gentle as I was, I already tore one map along the crease.  I am planning to make all of mine into posters, so I won't be opening and closing them repeatedly like many will but it would be nice if they had planned for all eventualities and put the maps on more flexible, lightweight paper.  I have to use a lot of tape to keep these up, which will eventually ruin the borders of the maps, which means I will eventually have to frame them.  Costly!  2) The ""journey's"" map had the potential to be the most interesting, especially seeing where people's paths cross.  But it's really poorly drawn.  All the lines are too confusing, the colors are too similar and there is NO KEY to easily match the colors with the character!  You have to squint and rotate your map and tilt your head to figure out whose line is whose and then follow it.  I gave up without finishing anyone's journey properly.  That one can stay in the box."
1853,0,0.376530612244898,"But overall I would say that if you're a truly hardcore ASOIAF geek, you won't want to miss out on this set.  It's just too, too scrumptious.  It's the perfect companion for re-reading the books, and bringing the stories even more to life while we all wait for The Winds of Winter.  And it's almost like having your own opening credits sequence to the TV show right there at your fingertips.  I'm not sorry I bought it and I would definitely recommend it to others!"
1854,0,0.20347222222222225,As a fan of the series I used this as a companion while reading A Dance With Dragons. Sometimes it its nice to have the maps so you can visually see where the characters are. Each of the Song of Ice and Fire books have a small map of Westeros in the first few pages but many of the cities are not always listed and they aren't in color like they are in Lands of Ice and Fire. Since the books are centered around Westeros you don't always get a sense of what is Essos across the Narrow Sea. The Essos maps fills in some of those blanks (as well as make you wonder if George RR Martin will ever write about more of those cities). My favorite map is a map of Westeros that traces the travels of the main characters! After years of reading the series its easy to forget how far some of these characters have traveled. There are also maps of cities like Kings Landing and Braavos.
1855,0,-0.013095238095238099,"I would have given this 5 stars, but my only issue is that I thought this was a ""book of maps"", like an atlas where everything is bound. Instead this is actually a bunch of maps that are unbound. You open up the cover, the maps come out and your unfolding these big paper maps. Personally I would have preferred them to be bound, its less messy that way and you don't have to worry about folding them right to get them back in the cover.

1859,0,0.24876750700280117,"They are rather large and unwieldy to easily reference while reading, so what I have done is scanned each map in several sections on my home scanner and then used Photoshop to stitch the sections back together to have each map become a single image. This took a lot of work but the results turned out fantastic. I now have nice high resolution digital images of all the maps which I then wanted to put on my iPad for easy viewing while I read the books. I quickly learned the iPad doesn't have enough memory to handle images this size (each map was around 50MB). So, after some searching I found an App called ""Large Viewer"" which allows you to view very large images on the iPad after it ""processes"" them and this worked great. After it processes them it will then load each map very quickly and allows me to navigate the entire map effortlessly."

I felt sad at reading the inane production of the maps (eg too thick and hard to refold and store and creases that cause cracks). anyway, maybe you could go to an art supply store and buy some good quality malleable large blank (same size as maps) acid free cloth based art paper and then take it to Fed Ex Office (formerly Kinkos) and have them make some ""true to size"" color copies and then you could just store the others away and use the copies you have made. Maybe that would work. Why cant form and function ever meet in this world?!!! I tell you it drives me crazy! Its just like Frank Lloyd Wright being such a great designer, but there was always production flaws in his buildings (eg: Falling Water with the leaky problems with the river that runs through it and then building that beautiful house in LA out of sandstone and it was just crumbling like a sand castle until some people pitched in to have it fixed). Please God, make form finally fuse with function! Please! Please! Until then, maybe just get some copies of these nicely formed, crappy functioned maps copied onto good map paper at Fed Ex Office. Or, it might be better to just go to an art supply store and get a large cardboard portfolio holder to put them in and then store them flat inside and shove the whole thing in the back of the closet or behind the sofa or the piano if you have one.

And are we supposed to care more about Westeros or Essos? Becasue ADWD sure is Essos-centric. In fact, 99% of Martin's world seems to be made up of it, with the people living there viewing Westeros as some insignificant backwater. Reading AGoT, I thought that part of the world would just be a jumping-off point for Daenerys. But no, it now has become the virtual main setting of ASOIAF. Why did Martin make that decision? I want to find out what happens in Westeros. Or do I? I'm not sure what the reader is supposed to be focused on because Martin is just all over the place. Toward the end of the book, Dany hallucinates and talks to Jorah Mormont who reiterates that he told her to go to Westeros because Meereen was not where she belonged. I felt as if Martin was mocking us because it's what every frickin' reader would have told her as well. So why did you make us read hundreds of pages about her fretting away in Meereen?!

And honestly, are we supposed to care about what happens to the the billions of people in Meereen like the Brazen Beasts, Stormcrows, Sons of the Harpy, Hizdahr, etc.?

Martin goes out of his way to ensure that absolutely nothing remotely pleasant happens. I understand there are books with such tones, but after nearly 5,000 pages of it, you get a bit worn down. I know a big appeal of the series are the ""gray"" characterizations, and I agree, but does nearly everyone have to be a murderous sociopath with no regard for human life? This worked in the first three books because we weren't sure what characters we were going to root for or against.

A Feast For Crows began the downslide but I figured it was merely setup. But ADWD was even worse than setup because NOTHING HAPPENS. I'm really torn over whether I'll read The Winds of Winter if and when it's released. I don't think I have it in me to read another novel like ADWD.

1887,0,0.20444444444444443,"I enjoyed book 1, 2 and 3. Book 4 bogged down a bit so not my favorite. Book 5 is making me wish that the story would end because it's time. I have almost finished it. The story as written is different in many ways from the TV series. I don't mind that at all. Surprisingly, the author Martin did not have all the gratuitous sex as the TV series, but I guess that's what sells on TV. Over all I've enjoyed reading the books but as I said, I'm ready for it to end."
1888,0,-0.34310897435897436,"Ice and Fire Books 1 through 3 are brutal, powerful, and engaging if you can look beyond the cruelty and enjoy the ""game"".  Book 4 is brutal, ponderous and not very interesting.  Book 5 is brutal, boring, circuitous, and disappointing, and contains nothing but cruelty.  Martin has lost the game, dropped the reins, left the building."
1889,0,0.018678977272727257,"Having just slogged through ""A Dance with Dragons"", I am no longer interested in the fates of the characters -- those who remain -- and Mr. Martin's world has become an endless, dreary hell of death, destruction and despair.  I will not buy Books 6 through Infinity as I don't want to read about unrelenting hatred, gratuitous violence, baby killing, blood sacrifice, grotesque animal abuse, face eating and/or excrement eating, body fluids, gore, little boys being thrown overboard because ""their kind"" shouldn't be allowed to live, and men whose only use for women is to ""take"" them forcibly as a prelude to killing them.  Really, how many child rapes can an author cram into a series?  Hey! I enjoy sex scenes as much as the next person, but some of this dreadful stuff is kiddie porn."
1890,0,-0.13020833333333334,"It seems that Mr. Martin continues to write not to advance the story lines established in Books 1-3, but to vividly describe each and every horrible way a woman, man, child, infant, or beast can be gruesomely hurt and/or die.  And, oh yeah, forget about dying and coming back to a happy afterlife! Indeed, every story development that could be considered even slightly uplifting was left hanging back in Book 3."
1891,0,0.16904761904761906,"In some reviews of the early Ice and Fire books, Martin was favorably compared to Tolkien -- undeniably, Martin can write a powerful description. And, each author does have a double-barreled middle name! However, Tolkien developed an intricate, magical world in which loyalty, compassion, honor and even--gasp!--love could endure.  Martin's world is so dark and his characters so despicable that nothing worthy can endure. Tolkien wrote about a quest, Martin writes about --what? -- who cares?"
1892,0,0.225,Take the advice of many reviewers -- save your grey matter and skip this one.
1893,0,0.009722222222222224,"As other reviewers have mentioned, It seems to me that book 4 and book 5 should have been combined into one much shorter entity.  I found myself skimming several parts (especially the Reek/Theon parts) because they were so iterative and slow moving.  The quantity of characters is so vast that one loses interest in some of them.  The first book was amazing and the first 3 together were very, very enjoyable.  I'm disappointed in the last two and frustrated that we have what started out as a fascinating journey turn into ""a maze of twisty passages, all alike"" (for those of you who remember the old Adventure game).  You have to read the book, if you've read all the others, but it definitely doesn't stand alone."
1894,0,0.29120370370370374,"As a fan of the aSoIaF series, I have to say, I understand why the series has come under scrutiny post-Storm of Swords. After that book, which was the best in the series (well-plotted, fast moving, just overall awesome), a Feast for Crows was released, which showed a noticeable slowing down of things. I believe George RR Martin, while still being able to write beautifully and create whole characters, has lost his ability of pacing the story well. Ultimately, A Dance with Dragons, like aFfC, suffers the same problems, but this time even more so than its predecessor."
1895,0,0.0,"At least in aFfC, things were kicking into high-gear in the last 150 pages or so. A Dance with Dragons only became exciting to me in the last chapter and the epilogue. The first three books were filled with exciting moments placed throughout the story--that's why they call them 'page-turners'. Getting through this book at times was a struggle. When I got to chapters that I knew would be boring (Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, for example), the only thing that got me through it was flipping ahead and seeing that a Reek or Arya chapter was soon to follow. Don't get me wrong, I like Barristan Selmy and Quentyn, but particularly with Dany's story in Meereen, barely ANYTHING happens in the book. It is paced so poorly that I really feel like half of her chapters could've been axed. Also, what is up with the ONE Jaime chapter in which, again, basically nothing happens? Martin ended aFfC with this huge (and kind of lame) cliffhanger with Brienne...and when we finally see her again, we learn absolutely nothing. We're just left with another cliffhanger, this one just lamer than the last."
1896,0,0.07619047619047618,"There are still occasional bright spots in aDwD, particularly with the Dreadfort/Stannis scenes in the North and Victarion Greyjoy. Theon has always been a compelling character to me (I believe Bran will communicate through him through the weirwoods and the ravens), and Victarion's storyline is very well done. He seems like a menacing guy, and I can't wait to see how he ties into the main plot concerning Dany."
1897,0,0.135625,"So, in summary, I hope George RR Martin has recognized the pacing problem his last two novels have suffered from. Fans are still invested in this story and these characters, but please, get things moving! We read a nearly 1000 page book, and the events that actually happened that were interesting and of importance probably could've been condensed into 500 pages. In the end, aDwD builds up to two major battles that NEVER HAPPEN!"

Yet again, you will laugh, cry, hold your breath and hope you favorites make it out of alive - SPOILER ALERT - I promise you will have to say good-bye to at least one or two of your favorites."
1899,0,0.013888888888888886,"In A Dance with Dragons, you really get the feel that the game of thrones has been played hard, and is reforming into something other than what it was becoming with the first book in the series of “A Song of Ice and Fire”."

Can’t wait. I liked that more characters were in this book (although Jaime was only in here briefly) still a lot of different people were in this, again had issues keeping the lesser known ones straight. There is no way that the HBO show could give everyone air time. Too much. Can’t wait to read the next book."
