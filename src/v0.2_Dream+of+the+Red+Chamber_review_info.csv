0,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
1,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
2,0,This book is superb. I have read the Chinese version. Mr Hawkes' work is not only a translation but a gloss on the original text in modern language albeit in English.
3,0,"This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing."
4,0,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
5,0,"I have now read all three volumes of the David Hawkes' translation of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' and I am simply blown away by the sheer volume of the text, and how there is never a dull moment. Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."
6,0,Don't miss this series.
7,0,Excellent edition with all three in new shape.
8,0,Love the book and the series! It's a fascinating book and I highly suggest it. Can't wait to read it!
9,0,'Thank the Lord for that!' said Bao-yu fervently. 'If only she could shake it off altogether!'
10,0,Nightingale looked up at him with amusement:
11,0,'It's not often we hear you calling on the Lord.'
12,0,Bao-yu returned her smile:
13,0,'Any doctor will do in an emergency.'
14,0,"Man oh man, this is one bittersweet book, folks. It's the sunset of an era for the Jia family, and everyone and their dog knows it. Dai-yu, Bao-yu, Xi-feng, and nearly half of the characters are either sick or depressed. Anything not nailed down is being pawned off out the yinyang. Prospect Garden empties out its beautiful girls. Hell-- things are so bad, the servants can't even keep the damn gates locked at night. As Xi-feng bemoans when trying to bean-count the family's way out of bankruptcy, the Jias are slaves to their own past good fortunes and it's about time that the chickens come home to roost."
15,0,"To be frank, it doesn't have the spellbinding whimsy of the The Golden Days, or the splendorous atmosphere of The Crab-Flower Club. What The Warning Voice does have, however, is a helluva mood. True to its spirit of Taoism, the characters are liberated by their own true natures, and entrapped by spider webs of their own design:"
16,0,"In the first half, the girls of Prospect Garden explore their talents, their ambitions, and even their sexualities and genders. One girl pretends to be the wife of another girl until it feels real, while one of Bao-yu's servants begins to adopt a male persona. And both are treated with such wonder, sensitivity, and total lack of sensationalism that it sneaks up on you. But all it takes is some jealous and irrational busybodies, and next thing you know -- Bao-yu is wandering an empty garden."
17,0,"I wanted to yell at this book for how it puts these people, who I feel like I've known since they were boys and girls, through terrible misery. At the center of the impending disasters is Dai-yu, because like a flower, she is blooming into something beautiful -- and also very, very, very, VERY not long for this world. Bao-yu, meanwhile, is shaping up to be quite a sensitive, smart, and caring man...just in time to wave goodbye to her."
18,0,"The most bittersweet thing of it all is knowing there's two more volumes, and things must get worse before they get better. And it's bittersweet to move on without David Hawkes as the trusty translator, my companion through this foreign world (I sure hope the next volume explains why he stopped, because half the joy is cross-referencing his translation with the Chinese, and appreciating Hawkes's good sense and creativity). But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."
19,0,I bought this for a friend after reading my copy of the 1975 (I think) edition with the pages turning yellow. It's like medicine. Everyone who struggles with the idea that God is a God of love should read this. Excellent Biblical perspective on how God's love can be known even in the painful experiences of life. Why God's love isn't obvious on the basis of casual observation. Impossible to understand without faith in Jesus Christ.
20,0,"I feel like this is a preacher who is preaching the deep, meat of the Lord's heart.....Oswald Chambers is my favorite!  Every paragraph has a compelling and truthful thought."
21,0,Oswald Chambers teachings are always challenging but the challenge is always good to bring us back to the word of God.
22,0,Fabulous book. I've read it three times and keep reading it. Oswald Chambers was really a wonderful godly man. Very deep
23,0,Oswald chambers has taught me a depth of the he bible that has been astoundingly beautiful. He is the one person including his precious wife that I can't wait tp see I'm heaven. His love of Christ and his devotion to our Lord is sweet fragrance of heaven!
24,0,As usual Oswald makes you think!!
25,0,Anything O Chambers writes is dynamite
26,0,Great amounts of wisdom in this book. Oswald never disappoints with his writing. Definitely worth a read and definitely a book I will read multiple times throughout life!
27,0,"Awesome book, and anything Oswald Chambers writes is annointed by the Holy Spirit. You will see a man dying to flesh to write HIS heart out."
28,0,I love anything by Oswald Chambers and it makes an excellent gift for anyone that needs an insight to the word of God.
29,0,"I recently purchased this book because I've read it in the past and will need to make reference to it (though I have pretensions of scholarship, this is not a scholarly review!).  I enjoy reading everything written by Anthony Yu.  In _Re-Reading_ I appreciate his detailed analysis and his direct comment on religious elements in Honglou Meng (Dream of the red chamber).  Anthony Yu is willing to take on the broad community of scholars to make his particular points of emphasis and in Re-Reading I feel he especially allows for a closer sympathy to the characters of the novel and their engagement with their own destinies.  Some may feel the theory to be a little steep but I feel the whole discussion helps me personally to work through what I see in the novel."
30,0,"It truly is a challenge to find a well written Christian novel.  I've only found a few and this is one of them. I don't know who the protagonist, Will Chambers, is modeled after or if he's a composite, but I would like to meet him or them! He is a very brilliant, insightful attorney. The story expertly combines Will's natural abilities with God's supernatural interventions, weaving them together to hold the reader's attention until the story is resolved on the final page!"
31,0,"Grabbed from the beginning, this novel held me throughout. If you’re a lesser us better when it comes to government, this will drive you nuts. I found myself so engrossed with the drama unfolding that I began to join in with Will as he fights the system which had gone off the rails. A must read from an author who truly engages his readers."
32,0,"As far as I'm concerned,  Mr. Parshall is #1 in the legal thriller  genre; better than John  Grisham.  He expertly weaves his stories through twists, turns and surprises. This story really carried me quickly through to the end. I read it in one day. I love that he includes Christianity in his books. His faith adds so much depth to the story. I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. As a former legal secretary,  I'm always fascinated by legal thrillers."
33,0,"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall.  As with the first one, this is well done."
34,0,The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse.  There are many twists and turns throughout.  The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.
35,0,"In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues.  The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline.  That part is well done also."
36,0,"I will certainly be checking out more books in this series.  I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."
37,0,This is an excellent thriller series. Lots of action. You will not want to put it down. Read them in order.
38,0,The premise is scary. This is an engrossing book I recommend you read this when you have a lot of time to read it
39,0,"Enjoyed this one as much as the first book in the series.  Holds your interest.  And the characters are very ""real""."
40,0,I look forward to the read. Thanks
41,0,EXCELLENT READ. Would like to believe a lawyer could have this much feeling for jusice and the truth.
42,0,"Of the five books in this series, I've only read the first two.  This book was more enjoyable than the first. I didn't want to put it down."
43,0,"If you've read the novels this far, you want to know how it all ends.  The translator, however, in his preface, indicates that many things contribute to this volume seeming convoluted and straying from the general theme of the previous books.  First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition."
44,0,"You get some closure--the story draws to an end and homage is paid to the theological theme of realizing the primacy of the spiritual world over the material world.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say that you are expecting a fall from grace with a stalwart conviction that life isn't over--a Chinese version of the Book of Job--but you get a lot of deus ex machina events that give it more of a fairy tale ending than what Cao Xueqin hinted at throughout the first three volumes."
45,0,Part of my culture
46,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
47,0,This novel definitely deserves its place in the topmost tier of global literature.  I was not convinced of that until I reached this volume. Amazing that it came to such a complete and inevitable conclusion when it had to be finalized after the author's death by others.
48,0,"I read all  5 volumes of this translation of the 18th Century Chinese novel known as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. The stone in question is a small magic jade found in the mouth of the newborn Jia Baoyu. It is the story of the journey through life of that stone and the beautiful young man Bao-yu. Written 300+ years before Downton Abbey this is also a story of a family, the fabulous mansion and garden they live in and the complicated relationships they have with their many servants. Poetry, painting, landscape and architecture, flowers, herbal medicines, Taost priests and Buddhist monks, rape, murder, thievery, jealousy, corruption, death and beauty dance through the pages like nothing else I have ever read."
49,0,"I've read all parts of The Story of the Stone.  It starts and ends in a mystical fashion; coming full circle in a traditional ying/yang way.  Wonderful five volume story about two wealthy families closely connected to the throne.  Although there's not much known about the true author, I suspect that it was written by a maid.  There is incredible detail from the perspective of the servents working for their sometimes nutty employers.  The family actually built a garden at one point in honor of a visit from a daughter who had been chosen to be a royal concubine.  If you want to immerse yourself in the ups and downs, daily life, (warts and all) of 1750's Chinese culture don't miss The Story of the Stone et al."
50,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
51,0,Great series.
52,0,This is the fifth and final installment in the classic Chinese story.  It gives a feel for cultural history of the Chinese people.
53,0,"Read it for a literature class in college. Interesting story, would recommend. This is book 5 of a 5 book set. Each book has 24 chapters."
54,0,"It truly is a challenge to find a well written Christian novel.  I've only found a few and this is one of them.

65,0,EXCELLENT READ. Would like to believe a lawyer could have this much feeling for jusice and the truth.
66,0,"Of the five books in this series, I've only read the first two.  This book was more enjoyable than the first. I didn't want to put it down."
67,0,The following is a review of only the first of the five volumes:
68,0,The Golden Days (The Story of the Stone #1)
69,0,"This book is first of a five volume English translation of a Chinese classic, Dream of the Red Chamber (a.k.a. The Story of the Stone) composed by Cao Xueqin. It generally considered as one of China's Four Great Classical Novels. It was written sometime in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty, and the setting of the story is early in the 18th century."
70,0,"This book was selected by Great Books KC group as our exposure to non-western literature for the year 2016. At the time Dream of the Red Chamber was selected for our schedule we didn't realize how long the complete work is. The Story of the Stone (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by John Minford, consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices). Total page count is 2,572. Our group decided to limit our discussion to the first volume as a more manageable reading assignment. I have no intention of completing the other four volumes any time in the foreseeable future."
71,0,"It's my understanding that the complete story is about the beginning grandeur and eventual decline of the aristocratic Jia family clan. As indicated by its title, The Golden Days, this first volume is focused on the beginning prosperous years. The book provides a detailed insight into wealthy Chinese cultural life of the time and the story's narrative includes frequent use of poetry."
72,0,"But this novel lays out a sprawling story line with numerous characters with names impossible for western readers to remember or pronounce. This is combined with excruciating details which at times can be beautiful, but overall becomes a heavy forest of words for the reader to slog through. Frankly, I didn't appreciate the experience very much. If I feel this way after the first volume I hate to imagine how I would feel should I manage to complete all five volumes."
73,0,"I downloaded this free version, because it was listed elsewhere in the top five most popular non religious texts of all times. What we have is part two, with part one not available for free from Amazon, yet."
74,0,"At this point, I can't recommend this particular item. Either buy a copy or look on the net where part one and two are freely available. Not able to comment on the merits of this translation because I will have to read the first twenty four chapters (part one) first."
75,0,Also known as The Dream of the Red Chamber.
76,0,GOOD!
77,0,good book
78,0,I think it was part one. It also does not use the standard names that the rest of the English versions use. When I tried to talk to others about it after I was done they filled me in on what actually happened and I could not easily correlate the people that they were talking about. Very frustrating. But the story was enjoyable even though not much happens in this section - which is longer than War and Peace.
79,0,"I am an avid reader, approximately 100 books per year on a variety of topics and themes.  I have to say that The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger is one of the most unreadable books I have ever encountered.  I powered through over half of the book before I asked myself;  WTH am I spending my time reading this nonsense.  I will never attempt to finish this book due to the intense boredom of it.  I can't say more than that except don't waste your time."
80,0,Confusion and Unmoored Sufferings
81,0,"While reading this book, it almost seemed like the author was creating confusion and misery for misery and confusion’s sake!  Why would you do that in the first book of a series?  If Stephen King’s name wasn’t on this book, I sincerely doubt most readers would have finished reading it.  That said after completing the book I googled it and found King’s fans encouraging people to “power” through the book because book two is good, while on the same page I found others talking about underage sex that is weird in further editions of the series.  This leads me to one question:"
82,0,"“Why did you create such frivolous misery in your novel Mr. King?”  Apart from Jake, it just seems like pain that neither builds the character, nor furthers the story.  It is, to me, uninteresting and does nothing but sear and jade your reader’s imagination."
83,0,"This book was much less interesting than some less known/self-published smaller authors today like AC Cobble, Peter Flannery, A.G. Riddle and others.  In fact this being the first Stephen King book I’ve ever read, I was left wondering if the only reason he has been so popular was due to the advertisements of his brand over the years.  After all, prior to Amazon a writer could not easily get their works known or published.  I now wonder if King is really deserving of his lofty place amongst well known literary authors."
84,0,"The final quarter of this book from the flashback of Roland’s “coming of age” through the cave onward was decent and even good occasionally, but prior to that I wanted to stop reading the book several times."
85,0,"Maybe my review is unfair, but this doesn’t seem like a work worthy of one of the past century’s most popular authors.  Read it if you must, or just read the cliff’s notes version and save yourself some pointless misery."
86,0,"I don't understand the fascination with this series, much less Stephen King.  Most of his books end up with an alien monster.  This one ended up in the trash."
87,0,"Stephen King says he started his epic series, THE DARK TOWER, when he was a very young man. Perhaps with the arrogance and/or enthusiasm of youth this series is a mash-up of any number of literary traditions. In most hands it could have wound up a mess."
88,0,"THE GUNSLINGER, the first in the series, opens, appropriately enough, with “the gunslinger” chasing an unidentified man across a nameless desert:"
89,0,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”"
90,0,"The scene has the look and feel of an old spaghetti western, which King freely admits:"
91,0,“… I realized that what I wanted to write was a novel that contained Tolkien’s sense of quest and magic but set against Leone’s almost absurdly majestic Western backdrop.”
92,0,I think he succeeded:
93,0,"“The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way…”"
94,0,The Gunslinger (eventually we learn is name is Roland – an epic/mythic/heroic name) comes across a mysterious young man who has somehow been transported from (our) contemporary New York to this strange land. No attempt is made at explanation.
95,0,"When Roland comes to a town, we learn that this is post-apocalyptic time in which the world as we know it has been destroyed, possibly though nuclear war. It is a dystopian vision that predates the current popularity of such stories."
96,0,"As the journey continues, old-fashioned magic becomes part of the mix. Also a bit of derring do in the style of Indiana Jones. Also some fantasy in the vein of George R. R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” (“Winter is coming.”)"
97,0,"And, of course, questions of good versus evil are explored."
98,0,Whew.
99,0,"Any type of cross-genre mixing is difficult to do well, much less on an epic scale. I have not even looked at subsequent books in the series in the hopes of being continually surprised when I do read them. I expect this volume is a good launch. If anybody could make it a success it would in the hands of Stephen King."
100,0,"There are many Stephen King books that I really enjoy (Salems Lot, Finders Keepers, The Stand, 11/22/63 just to name a few . . . in fact, 11/22/63 is one of my all-time favorite books).  As such, I really had high hopes for The Gunslinger.  However, the story line was disjointed, confusing, and not very enjoyable at all.  I kept expecting the flow of the book to smooth-out and become a ""cannot put down"" read.  However, this never occurred.  In the end, I was completely disappointed.  I have heard that other Dark Tower books are much better, but I disliked The Gunslinger so much that I'm not sure I'll read any others."
101,0,Once one of my all time favorite books.
102,0,"Stephen King revised this book and it is TERRIBLE!!!  You get no back story and don’t know who some of the characters are, how they played a roll in Roland’s life, what he went through to get to where he is now. NOTHING!!!  It is terrible!!"
103,0,"In terms of story, this is easily the best volume in the series so far. The characters and setting have so much depth, and we learn much about who they all are and why they've been thrust together on this ongoing, epic journey."
104,0,"And this story FEELS epic, too, as Roland and his band of unlikely heroes traverse miles and miles from the first page to the last. The setting and descriptions are all wonderful - you can see, hear, and smell everything the characters are... for good or ill, because some of the places the characters find themselves in are pretty bleak, to say the least."
105,0,"The only problem is that it ends on a cliffhanger. Which ordinarily, would be cause for an immediate one-star review from me, and a solemn vow to never read another book in the series. But because this is Stephen King, and because I've been mostly happy with the series so far, I'm going to press on and give it another shot."
106,0,"Then, the Kindle Edition I read is riddled with typos. Most of these are probably OCR issuess from scanning a print edition of this book, but it just smacks of plain laziness on the part of the publisher. I've reported them all as ""Quality Issues"" on Amazon."
107,0,Roland went for a walk in the desert.  He had a mule with no name.  Did he feel good to get out of the rain?  I can't remember  ...  the palaver left me too numb to care for his pain.
108,0,"This might be a useful introduction to an epic series,  but the story does not stand in its own."
109,0,"Reading this series again, after King finally concluded it - and though it's been over a decade since my first reading of the gunslinger's ka-tet, it's like my old friends have been waiting for my return. In this slice of the tale, the other characters start coming into their own and King draws his characters a deeper hue, layering meaning and darkening shadows."
110,0,"It's a tense ride, a fulfilling adventure and page-turner that starts to eat away at your sleeping hours. Be warned, I think these pages are laced with some addictive substance...maybe Eddie's been at it again. I can't stop reading this series."
111,0,"I know these are supposed to be the great Stephen King epic, but after three books and NOTHING happening I give up. I don't even care about the characters and he has spent 3 books developing them. He is constantly making references to the pop culture of the 1980s so I,m guessing in 10 years or so no one will know what he's talking about. There are better books to read I'm done."
112,0,"This thrilling mystery movie which has touches of horror and delves deeply into the paranormal was a quintessential ""whodunit"" which will keep you engaged and guessing until the very end. Cate Blanchet, the consummate  actress, offers another spellbinding performance, and Hillary Swank and Keanu Reeves provide excellent supporting roles. Giovanni RibisiI adds an additional powerful and convincing performance to the story as a very disturbed young man with whom Cate, the lead character, deals with compassionately. I never cease to be amazed at Cate Blanchet's ability to portray a role with such honesty and realism that you completely forget the person she portrays is a character in a movie."
113,0,This was a surprisingly entertaining movie. Cate Blanchett was excellent and Giovani Ribisi had the most interesting character (his involvement was why I elected to watch this).
114,0,"Blanchett plays a woman with ""gifts"" who gets involved with a murder investigation. She's not all knowing and her visions come in flashes that tend to terrify her as much as offer any insight. There is some effective camera work by Sam Raimi, although there is a bit of a tendency for kind of cheap thrills (surprise off screen entrances, etc.). Then again, this film is from 2001, so my perception of that might be just an indication that it's somewhat dated. Still very entertaining and well directed."
115,0,"The ending is a bit predictable, but so is every movie. I'm more interested in the cast and the emotional roller coaster along the way, and this film certainly has that. Keanu Reeves is cast in a part that's a bit of a departure for him, as is Katie Holmes. This must have been before she got married to Tom Cruise and ended up in crazy town."
116,0,"Billy Bob Thorton is the writer (lots of big names involved with this), and I read this story is based on the experiences of his mother who also reportedly had psychic abilities. I thought it was refreshing how Cate Blanchett is not overly sexualized in this film (wears tennis shoes except for in one party scene). She comes across as very nurturing, and it was a nice departure from most hollywood films."
117,0,"I enjoyed it, it scared my wife though."
118,0,"The only reason the movie was able to be action packed was because of the unbelievable and unrealistic stupidity and helplessness of the main character.  She is just constantly moronic, and I can't think of a single real life female who would display such a chronic case of brainlessness.  I found it shameful the way Cate's character was portrayed as being at the total mercy of men and unable to care for herself.  As horrible as this is, make no mistake, this is what carries the movie.  It's unfortunate that the degradation of women is used for entertainment.  But I think things have changed since 2000; women in movies since have demonstrated use of their brains."
119,0,"It's hard to recognize Cate Blanchett.  She is completely lost within the character.  I loved her portrayal of a poor Southern woman.  The movie itself it quite brutal, and most of the violence is directed against women.  I have never been able to classify violence against women as entertainment, and I am very concerned about people who do.  For that reason, I wish I had never seen this movie.  However, I sat through it because of Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi  and the plot twists.  I do like the ending."
120,0,"Everyone did a phenomenal job in this movie! The Southern accents were so believable! Australian-born Cate Blanchett was super convincing as a Southern fortune teller, and Keanu Reeves' character was very compelling as well; rarely have I seen him play personas that have a vile nature but that's what I liked about his role in this film; it was something different to behold compared to other characters he's played. I have to say, though, I was hoping to actually see ""Donnie"" get released from jail and possibly even become friends with ""Annie."" (Wishful thinking, I know, but I believe that would have added a nice touch of fulfillment to the movie). Ultimately, it ended on a good note, thankfully."
121,0,"I bought this film so that I could watch it over and over It's one of Blanchett's earlier and less known movies, but it's powerful. Some places put it in the horror category, but I would say it's more in the suspense genre. It combines the paranormal with a murder mystery and strikes all of the right tones. Blanchett heads an amazing cast with Hilary Swank, Keanu Reaves, J.K. Simmons, Greg Kinnear and Giovanni Ribisi. Movies don't usually feature that many Academy Award winners and nominees for awards. Blanchett creates a very appealing character in Annie, a mystical woman who is trying to take care of her three sons after her husband is killed. Ribisi is nothing short of amazing in the way he portrays ""Buddy,"" the town mechanic with a deep and dark past that even Annie can't penetrate when she is distracted by a murder that rocks the community. Very engaging and entertaining to watch."
122,0,"Intense drama.  Excellent characters performed by each star.  I would give it 5 stars but I was uneasy throughout much of it due to Keanu's role, and I am a sensitive soul.  Just me.  The movie accomplished exactly what it was designed to do."
123,0,Very Heavy stuff.  Hard one to grade.  The acting is top notch and movie is powerful and compelling but exceedingly difficult to watch/witness as it focuses on the ugliness people can inflict on each; particularly actions inflicted upon women and children related to family violence. My wife had to quit watching it.  I would never watch it again but I give the producers credit for making a movie about situations that unfortunately are all too real in many families. Cate Blanchett is terrific...she is a gift to the movie
124,0,"This is a well acted movie with excellent plot twists. The cast is fantastic and so believable as a small-town South community. I thought Hillary Swank was spot-on with her interpretation of her character. Plus, it was great to see Keanu Reeves play the bad guy since he hardly ever does. He's good at it, and should take more villain roles. They both got the husband/wife domestic violence vicious circle just right. High praise for this thriller! Buy it, hands-down."
125,0,"A movie for adults possessing a modicum of intelligence and a mature attention span. This film came out in 2000, and is definitely not to be confused with a different movie of the same name released in 2015."
126,0,"This psychological thriller showcases the early acting chops of the wonderful Cate Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes, Hilary Swank and a menacing Keanu Reeves, with fine support from Gary Cole, J.K. Simmons and Kim Dickens."
127,0,"It has a few riveting scenes straight out of a horror flick, but strives for and achieves so much more."
128,0,"If you've read the novels this far, you want to know how it all ends.  The translator, however, in his preface, indicates that many things contribute to this volume seeming convoluted and straying from the general theme of the previous books.  First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition."
129,0,"You get some closure--the story draws to an end and homage is paid to the theological theme of realizing the primacy of the spiritual world over the material world.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say that you are expecting a fall from grace with a stalwart conviction that life isn't over--a Chinese version of the Book of Job--but you get a lot of deus ex machina events that give it more of a fairy tale ending than what Cao Xueqin hinted at throughout the first three volumes."
130,0,Part of my culture
131,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
132,0,This novel definitely deserves its place in the topmost tier of global literature.  I was not convinced of that until I reached this volume. Amazing that it came to such a complete and inevitable conclusion when it had to be finalized after the author's death by others.
133,0,"I read all  5 volumes of this translation of the 18th Century Chinese novel known as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. The stone in question is a small magic jade found in the mouth of the newborn Jia Baoyu. It is the story of the journey through life of that stone and the beautiful young man Bao-yu. Written 300+ years before Downton Abbey this is also a story of a family, the fabulous mansion and garden they live in and the complicated relationships they have with their many servants. Poetry, painting, landscape and architecture, flowers, herbal medicines, Taost priests and Buddhist monks, rape, murder, thievery, jealousy, corruption, death and beauty dance through the pages like nothing else I have ever read."
134,0,"I've read all parts of The Story of the Stone.  It starts and ends in a mystical fashion; coming full circle in a traditional ying/yang way.  Wonderful five volume story about two wealthy families closely connected to the throne.  Although there's not much known about the true author, I suspect that it was written by a maid.  There is incredible detail from the perspective of the servents working for their sometimes nutty employers.  The family actually built a garden at one point in honor of a visit from a daughter who had been chosen to be a royal concubine.  If you want to immerse yourself in the ups and downs, daily life, (warts and all) of 1750's Chinese culture don't miss The Story of the Stone et al."
135,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
136,0,Great series.
137,0,This is the fifth and final installment in the classic Chinese story.  It gives a feel for cultural history of the Chinese people.
138,0,"Read it for a literature class in college. Interesting story, would recommend. This is book 5 of a 5 book set. Each book has 24 chapters."
139,0,"This is a masterful approach to the primary themes and characters of the greatest of all Chinese novels. THE STORY OF THE STONE runs five (thick) volumes in length, has literally hundreds of characters, takes place in a very specific historical era, and mirrors both the religious and social practices of the time and also the broader political landscape in which the story takes place. I managed to love it the first time I read it even though I knew almost nothing about any of that, but successive readings have given me hundreds of questions, and this book has helped me find many answers. I'm not a scholar, so what matters to me is that this book, tough sledding though it can be at times, actually increases my enjoyment of one of my three or four favorite novels."
140,0,The editors made an inspired decision to aim this volume at both teachers and researchers. The result is a veritable treasure-trove of pedagogical insights and scholarship.
141,0,"I'm a big fan of both authors, so I was hugely disappointed with this book. It was both the characters & the ending that I did not like. Instead of finding Jordana to be an exciting, independent woman for the time period, I thought she was manipulative and self-serving in her actions, never considering the repercussions of her actions on other people. She had a singlemindedness about her that was not admirable because of the way she went about getting what she wanted, while confessing God's leading & protection. Her bullying of her older brother came off as disrespectful & mean, which was disturbing. The story of her older sister in CA drug on endlessly with both husband & wife repeating the same litany of complaints, without trusting God or each other with their burdens. I got tired of reading about them. I did enjoy & respect Jordana's brother & their new friend, Caitlyn. Adding to my dissatisfaction with the book, was getting to the end, only to find NO resolution to any of the main characters stories!"
142,0,"Rarely do I remove a book from my device, but this one is now gone."
143,0,"The biggest surprise in this book was that it didn't end!  Oh, there were no more pages to read . . . but none of the plot lines were resolved.  It ""ended"" in the middle.  I don't like being taken advantage of in this way and for this reason alone, I won't read any more in the series.  Normally, I love a series because I fall in love with the characters as I did with this book.  But I expect each book to also stand on its own.  This one doesn't."
144,0,So it's done  . . . and I'm done.
145,0,"I have read and enjoyed books by both authors, so I had high hopes for this novel.  I found this volume disappointing on many fronts.  The action took place across the US, with subjects ranging from the Civil War, the Transcontinental Railroad, Westward expansion,  and the photographic processes of the time period.  I thought the pacing was uneven, and sluggish for the most part.  The characters were fairly engaging,  but I felt that none of them were really well developed.  All seemed to have major trouble with communicating their needs and feelings.  There were multiple plot lines and NONE were fully resolved at the conclusion of this novel.  Even so, the ending felt contrived and I had a hard time believing that parents in that time period would be supportive of the choices their children made at the conclusion.  (This comment is vague intentionally so as not to be a spoiler)"
146,0,"I felt that the authors would have served their characters (and readers )better had they chosen to focus on one set of characters at a time, and had at least one plot line reach a satisfying conclusion in each novel.  The choices they have made impel the reader to buy multiple volumes in order to have any resolution.  This strategy failed in my case, as I just don't care what happens next to any of these characters."
147,0,Content Review:
148,0,Sex:none
149,0,Cursing: none
150,0,Violence: fistfights and gunshots
151,0,"Religion : prayer and trust in God mentioned often, but no strong statements of faith in Christ  or Salvation message."
152,0,There were two major stories in this book...
153,0,"1) Caitlan, an 18 year old Irish girl is sent away from home and a potentially nasty situation to America where her much older brother is living. A letter to Brenton and Jordana Baldwin (brother and sister, who's parents are in Russia for an extended work related stay) lets them know she will be arriving by ship soon to NYC, where they live. This was such a surprise, but they soon become fast friends, even though the difference in their social status is huge. It makes no difference to the wealthy brother and sister, but Caitlan, of the very poor working class feels the difference and will not take their offerings of lodging, so sets out to work as a chamber maid at another home. Eventually they all set off for a trek across America to find her brother in California. Now, mind you, it's during the Civil war and the three of them are 19, 16, and 18. Yikes. So that's the first story, the three young folk making their way through cities on trains with Brenton's photography gear, until there are no more rails, where at that point a wagon and horses are purchased to make their way across the plains and mountains, um, alone. Again, yikes."
154,0,"The second story is of Caitlan's brother, Kiernan and his wife Victoria, who is Brenton and Jordana's older sister. Kiernan, a handsome charming, hard working Irish lad, lost Victoria's fortune after they married when they went to California to mine gold. They move from place to place, barely scraping by, eating meagerly, but are very much in love. Little do they know (it is the 1860’s, and it's not like they can just view an email) his sister is escaping a bad situation and headed their way. They have no idea where she is, nor how to reach her, nor when she might get there, nor where she thinks she might meet them, since she doesn't even know where they are. Yep... yikes!"
155,0,Lots of exciting stories and events happen in both stories.
156,0,"I think this may be my favorite Judith Pella/Tracie Peterson book so far. I'd almost given up on their books because I was becoming less and less a fan. But the writing is good, and it truly keeps your interest. Although all the talk about railroads was boring to me, it was easy to skip a few paragraphs at a time to pick back up on the story a bit later."
157,0,"The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that this is not a full book. I may not have picked it up if I had known that, because now I don't know what happens to the three young people who have been traveling for over a year and are only about half way across the country. But it was a good book and well written, and you will want to find out what happens to the groups, which is the point isn't it?"
158,0,"After reading a couple of completely amateur freebie Westerns, tucking into this one proved to be pure delight. It brilliantly brings to life the early days of the Civil War from the viewpoint of young New Yorkers. A highlight was the young man's struggle with complex issues of enlisting. The plot treats the reader to a look inside the home of the Vanderbilts and high New York Society and the challenges and thrills of traveling West in wartime. A less engaging subplot follows the struggles of a California miner who  fritters away his wife's fortune and the repetitive narrative of their marital woes. This was but loosely engaged to the main plot and might better have been saved for a different volume."
159,0,"At times the writing sank toward the pedantic. Many pages are wasted with characters struggling over the same issues in their heads rather than living them in breathtaking action or clever dialog. A great editor should be all over that. Finally, the writers just seemed to pick a spot to stop writing with a small tease for the next volume of the series. If you enjoy a great ride to a breathtaking climax and a settling denouement, you'll not find it here."
160,0,"Judith Pella and Tracie Peterson have done a wonderful job collaborating on this Christian western romance.  We are introduced to the Baldwin family and their adventures in the building of the West in connection with the transpacific railroad.  In this book we learn to love each of the members of the Baldwin family as well as their extended family.  The female protagonist that stands out for me is Jordana.  We see her emerge from an adolescent into a woman.  The authors did a superb job in her character development.  I like the way they used the literary tool of foreshadowing to building the plot line rising action.  For example, when discussing Victoria’s life (the eldest of the Baldwin siblings) in California there is references to the Donner Pass.  Needless to say, if you are a history buff you are aware of the significance of the Donner Pass and the Donner Party.  Tapping into this knowledge makes the reader curious if Victoria’s husband gets caught in this situation.  This is an excellent example of the authors’ writing skills in keeping and maintaining the reader’s interest.  In addition, the author’s end the story at the correct point as now the reader wants to read more about each of these strong and determined characters.  You can’t help but root for their success but you are left with a big question as to what happens next.  Well done."
161,0,"An interesting read of the civil war and the conception of the railroads.  The story covers a couple in California who hunts the gold dream and ends up working for the railroad.  In love but unable to have children cause their marriage to strain, but they manage to hold on, barely."
162,0,"There's also a brother sister duo in New York.  Benton is a photographer who is hired to take pictures of the country, cities near where the railroads will be.  Jordana is finishing school, and has a lot of spunk and actually, she is what keeps the story going.  Then there is Caitlin,  who arrives from Ireland and is supposed to go to the couple in California."
163,0,"Great story line, just nothing is resolved in the end. Not really a cliffhanger, just a bland dead end.  Yet still worth reading if you are into the American civil war era and the railroads."
164,0,"Volume of a trilogy written about the railroad system being built from east to west. It is centered around an expansive family full if colorful characters. There is much history interspersed throughout the book alongside enjoyable romantic musings. The story is told from two different POV’s: a young brother and sister (late teens -20) plus Irish sister-in-law from the east AND an older married couple (but still young - late 20’s/early 30’s) already in California. As the story bounces back and forth, it does so quite easily and the reader begins to see the need for additional volumes...I’m off to start #2 right now!"
165,0,"I usually enjoy Tracie Peterson, but I struggled with continuing to read  this book.  Two characters continually repeated the same thoughts, one character was foolish, continuing to behave recklessly all the while claiming  God would protect her.  Twice I set the book aside, reading something else.  I persevered thinking I would find out what happened to at least some of the characters, but NO, it's a cliffhanger.  You have to buy the next book for ten dollars and hope you find out how it ends."
166,0,"The book started out rather stilted and improbable, and I almost quit reading it.  But then, suddenly, it came alive and I was caught up into the edge-of-my-chair adventure along with the compelling, completely believable characters and could not put the book down.  I liked the ending, and look forward to discovering where the story goes in the next book."
167,0,It is so good to find clean books that sweep me along on fascinating journeys.
168,0,"Stephen King's Dark Tower epic is easily one of my favorite fantasy series of all time.  It features a wonderful world mixing pretty much my two favorite things:  the world-building of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings & the imagery of Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy.  Unfortunately, I hadn't ever owned the complete series; I read them either through libraries, online or from friends. Having them all in one place where I can burn all my money in one go and re-read them again and again and again is the perfect gift to myself.  I'm not usually a fan of movie tie-in editions, but here it isn't distracting since it still features original covers (not movie stills).  You just have to see Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey's name on the box.  Overall if you've never owned the complete set then this is a fantastic investment.  If you've never read the series and are thinking about buying it on a whim, all I can say that is if you love fantasy, westerns, sci-fi, horror, epic adventure, and characters that you'll never want to stop traveling with, then stop reading this right now and hit the ""order"" button."
169,0,"I actually bought this as a gift for my dad, who reads constantly but does not tend to read fantasy, horror, or Stephen King. He told me it would be a while until he got started on the series because of deadlines (he's retired but still writes textbooks). Two days later he told me, jokingly, that he was very mad at me for getting him hooked on this series, as he has been unable to put the books down and binged the first 3 novels in 2 days, ignoring deadlines and emails and probably the various chores my mom assigned him. =D"
170,0,"Got me thru 3 months of segregation in prison.... Great read for those doing a decent amount of time... Glad I had the time.... Only in prison can u read so much so quick, usually uninterrupted, that I couldn't imagine trying to finish this whole  series in the world, unless jobless or Idk.... But you should get in tune with this one!"
171,0,"I bought this for my granddaughter.  I loved the fact I did not have to track down all of the books to purchase them.  She started with a book in the middle of the series without realizing she was reading out of sequence.  She did enjoy the book, so I decided to treat her to an exciting adventure that only author Stephen King can spin.  It was a mixture of an old western, some 14th century chivalry and good old fashioned on the edge of your seat reading.  The Stand was my favorite book, but this one definitely came in a close second.  This is totally worth the price of the set."
172,0,Read the 1st three books when they came out. Got the box set a month ago and read the series start to finish in about 3 weeks. Over all I enjoyed the books although I found more than a few errors and inconsistencies. If I reread the series again in a few years I will outline them even though I'm sure no one cares. Great story telling over all.
173,0,My son-in-law encouraged me for years to read this series. He read it when the books first came out and mentioned having to re-read some of the books to put it all together. That's why I hesitated reading it. I received the boxed set for Christmas and began my reading adventure. I believe it was easier to read as a complete series than over many years. As I read I learned so much about the author that helps me to understand Stephen King and that makes his books a better read. King's books are on so many different levels anyway and the Dark Tower series is even more yet. I loved how he made himself part of the story and told of his problems completing the series. I am at a loss now what to do tomorrow since I finished reading Dark Tower tonight. It's a true separation anxiety.
174,0,"I bought the Dark Tower Book series used so I was expecting a little wear and tear.  The books I received look brand new! There are no signs of wear and seeing as how they are going to be a bday gift, I believe he is going to be so impressed with the collection."
175,0,Bought this boxed set for my son for Xmas.  he loves it.  Great story and very well done as far as packaging and appearance.  The copies are new and in excellent condition.  the boxed set shipped in a larger box that they took the time to insulate again damaged.  Nice to know they took the time to protect their product against shipping damage.
176,0,I am impressed. There's only one insignificant detail on the copy of the waste lands as I display in the photo but it isn't a problem for me and the bookset is flawless besides that.
177,0,"  I went through every copy and every page and they smell like fresh print and there are no dents or scratches, which I was not expecting. For the price, the quality is 5 stars. I asked some questions to the seller about the publication and they replied immediately with a thorough answer that was very helpful."
178,0,"  I highly recommend buying from this seller. High quality product, excellent customer support, and incredibly low price. PS- if you're having trouble removing books from the bookcase; they give you three cardboard sheets which serve as sliders. You insert them on each side of the book you're removing and the book simply slides out as displayed in the photo above."
179,0,"On third book and enjoying the story, glad I got the whole set."
180,0,"Fun train ride through what is left of the town. Very interesting to read the history of the town once you have seen it. Well put together, lots of great photos."
181,0,"A unique and troubled time in America's past when dollars were more important than workers lives or the health of the natural environment. Coal barons raped the landscape, tore up the mountains, spoiled the rivers, treated miners and their families horribly and pretty much did what they darn well pleased."
182,0,"I was a competitive swimmer as a kid, and now I've returned to the pool after more than 25 years to try to become a competitive masters swimmer."
183,0,"The basics came back like riding a bicycle (except for the butterfly, which I couldn't remember how to do at all) but a lot has changed over the years, and my technique was clearly rusty."
184,0,"I don't have a coach, doing it on my own, and this book has been a tremendous help... and I'm not even done with it!"
185,0,"The tips on a proper catch, and their little listening trick to correct hand entry, took 2 full strokes off my pool length in freestyle, for example."
186,0,"This week I used their 4 phase method for learning butterfly to teach myself the stroke, and did my first pool lengths in fly.  I'm looking forward to using their other tips to refine the stroke and start adding it into my regular workout."
187,0,This is just a tremendous book.  Easy to read and follow.
188,0,"I strongly recommend it for anyone starting out, or making the transition from fitness swimming to competition, or returning to the water after a long time away."
189,0,Definitely worth many times the cover price.
190,0,My swimming background.
191,0,"I have been a swimmer all of my life. I swum competitively since the age of 12, began swimming Masters in 1978. I have been coaching masters in 1998. Like most masters coaches I always emphasized strokes and  seasonal conditioning periodizatuion meven though like most masters teams only about 1/3 of the swimmers compete. Even my swimmers who don't compete enjoy the variety. Also, we have growing number of triathletes most of whom were not from a competitive  swimming background."
192,0,"Ahl off this to is to say that this the most useful information and tools one book that hi have found. If you want to coach masters or you are a swimmer wants to improve you own swimming or to help your coach, BUY THIS BOOK! If you are a triathlete who wants to learn to "" swIm like a swimmer"" buy the book, but also find a masters team with a coach who emphasizes stroke instruction over long sets without technical instruction./"
193,0,Only had this book for a day and it's already given me so much information on anything I've had questions on. It goes straight into detail on every strokes and how to be properly prepared and what you should do before meets and what levels you feel comfortable with. I recommend for people like me who have a little late start in pursuing the swimming dream.
194,0,"Some Parts May be lacking in detail, but this overall targets the fears and weaknesses of the newbie swimmer. It has definitely improved my view on technique in stroke, breathing, and the importance of psychological stability in water."
195,0,"If you aren't that good at swimming, and you want to swim faster, stronger, and enjoy the water, then this book is for you"
196,0,"This is a great book.  It has a lot of drills, which if followed, will enhance you swimming skills.  Jim Montgomery has a lot of information he is willing to share."
197,0,the difference between this book and the other kindle books available on swimming technique is that it includes a section on open water swimming. I was surprised to see this. Usually that gets skipped in beginners books.
198,0,Good reference book for Masters swimmers.  You can always pick up a tip or two.  This book has lots of them.
199,0,"I was a swimmer my whole childhood, but dropped it when in highschool. Last year, I finally started swimming again. This book is an amazing tool for perfecting stroke technique and swimming mechanics. It also has some very interesting information on training, as well as cool drills and clear pictures."
200,0,This book is an introductory book of what swimming is.
201,0,Despite well written an not boring most of those that had some back ground in swimming will not find new things or methods.
202,0,Although it is a good introduction for someone that wants to know a bit more about the world of swimming.
203,0,I am adult learner and this book has proven so beneficial. VERY methodical and practical.
204,0,It is one of the most impressive literary artworks I have ever been through. The life of one of the most prominent families during the Qing Dinasty is depicted with such a remarkable finesse and delicacy as to make the reader aware of the refinement of Chinese culture. Specially recommended for those who would like to be introduced to Chinese history by the hand of one of the finest writers of all times.
205,0,"OMG the translation for this book was awful!!  I am sorry, but I would not dream of giving this book a positive review."
206,0,Not my style!
207,0,"Of course, this is a superior novel that's translated very well, indeed. However, this edition has been severely edited to the size of a novelette, which rather defeats the purpose of this long and detailed work. In fact, reducing the size of the work is pointless, even as an introduction."
208,0,Read the first volume of this work to give you a real feeling for the book's complexity.
209,0,"This addition is just a repackaging of the freely available 19th century public domain translation, which translation, by the way, is not even complete.  Don't waste your money."
210,0,This is the worst of the several English translations of this book (Story of the Stone and A Dream of Red Mansions are much better). This version is also free from gutenberg. Why is amazon charging for it?

234,0,"I was so looking forward to this coloring book that I also purchased the version printed in Thailand.  While I like things about both versions, for me, the US version is the clear winner.  Why?  Simply put – it has more designs to color.  I'll go into some of the differences at toward the end of this review."
235,0,"“The Night Voyage” is the story of a young girl and her cat, Phoebe, who go on a night adventure giving away presents to others.  Or did they?  That is the question left unanswered at the end of this story."
236,0,"The coloring book is filled with Daria Song's beautiful artwork and imaginative design concepts.  From paper crane airplanes to old-fashioned bicycles to gorgeous air balloons, each page is a wonderful opportunity to color."
237,0,"In addition to the 64 pages of designs, there are thumbnails of each and a bonus coloring page as well as a card that can be cut out and colored. (with both cutting lines and folding line included.)"
238,0,"This is what I experienced while coloring in this book and testing the page with my coloring medium.  In the comments section below, I will list the coloring medium I use for testing and coloring."
239,0,64 pages of Daria Song designs plus bonus page and card
240,0,Printed on both sides of the page
241,0,"Paper is bright white, very lightly rough, heavyweight and non-perforated"
242,0,Binding is both glued and sewn – not the type that is easy to snip threads to remove pages.  I don't recommend this as so many of the designs spread across two pages
243,0,Designs merge into the binding area
244,0,Most designs spread across two pages
245,0,Separate dust cover which has coloring opportunities on the inside and an attached cover which can be colored as well.
246,0,Alcohol-based markers bleed through this paper
247,0,"Water-based markers, gel pens and India ink pens do not bleed through and do not leave shadows on the back of the page.  Some gel pens require additional drying time."
248,0,"Colored pencils worked very well with this paper.  I tested oil and wax based pencils.  I was able to get good pigment lay down with both types.  Layering the same color for deeper color, multiple colors and blending with a blending stick worked well and easily."
249,0,US versus Thailand printing:
250,0,Both versions have their advantages.  The Thailand version was printed on a slightly off white when compared to the US one (thought I originally thought of it was simply white.)  It also had colored images and colored cards included with some single page versions of designs which were on two-pages spreads.  You can see my review and video of this version from May of this year on Amazon under the name “The Present” by Daria Song.
251,0,"For me, the US version was the better of the two but I am happy that I have both.  The US version is printed on bright white paper that was able to take all but alcohol-based markers without showing through.  There are many pages of designs not included in the Thailand version at all.  The detached dust cover, which is different from the original two books by Ms. Song, was a nice new touch with coloring opportunities as well.  While the books are approximately the same size and the US version actually has less pages overall, it weighs more which leads me to believe that the paper is thicker."
252,0,"I was so excited to receive my pre-order.  I have ALL of Daria Song coloring books!  ""the night voyage"" adventure is breathtaking!"
253,0,"I promise, I did not bend this book nor did I turn it inside of itself but, the first 3-pages came loose within 4-days of using this book. I am really disappointed as I had colored heavily on 4-pages and got them to the point where I was pleased with them. Opening the book on day 5 and having the pages come loose was so not cool at all. I will tape them in and have a binder for books that do this. The book is my favorite of the 3 released thus-far and this is a big disappointment because it had not happened to the other books, just this one."
254,0,"Like others have said and as some have demonstrated in pictures, the images are really stunning. I would purchase again and may need to because of the loose page issue. I just cannot figure out how to prevent this as I had used the book lying flat."
255,0,"I would give this lovely coloring book five stars if it were not printed to the very edges of the pages. That makes coloring the edges difficult, and elements in the binding side are impossible to completely color (many of the scenes are two-page spreads). Trying to color into the crease ends up breaking the back and loosening the pages. The pictures are whimsical, very detailed, and definitely not the type that can be colored in a few minutes. The paper quality is excellent for colored pencils. I find that I get the best results with pencils that are of a little firmer texture. The book has a fairly heavy card type cover and a dust jacket over that."
256,0,"The pictures are of a dream adventure, so don't expect consistency from page to page in what the little girl is wearing or how her hair is styled!"
257,0,"If you want the best I MEAN BESTTTT!!! Color book out there.. Here it is.. It has advanced drawn pictures that will take you hours to finish.  The paper is high quality and can withstand most coloring pencils, water color pencils and also water color in pots and liquids.  It can take some markers but not the Spectrum noir markers. Those bleed through the paper.  I have had good luck with the Crayola metal markers and no bleed though.  There are sooo many pages in here, that if you color every day it will still take you months to finish.  Most of the drawn images are in two page fold outs and alot of trees (my favourite)  and also ariel views and just so many little details!  Hope you enjoy.  I was so happy when i saw Amazon sitting on my doorstep.. :)  THANK YOU DARIA SONG!!  This is by the way, her best book yet!  I have all of them."
258,0,"THESE ARE GORGEOUS and HIGH QUALITY.  Keep in mind that these are not perforated pages and pages are not meant to be torn out.  This is a storybook that you can give uncolored or colored as a gift.  There is a bonus card on the very last page, and that can be cut out.  It is a good sized card but VERY small and difficult to color.  I would suggest fineliners.  The paper does let you use a variety of pens and pencils without bleeding through but of course you should test it first.  If you press very hard on your pages as you color, try to take it easier, as the paper is very thick but the impressions can still show through."
259,0,"There is a dust-cover, which is also just wonderful.  Remove that while you work and then put it on to protect it or make it more presentable as a gift."
260,0,I'm mad for Daria Song's stuff now.  Each of her books are incredible and I have now bought 2 more besides.  There's a real satisfaction when a page is done--and these are actually worth your time and worth keeping.
261,0,"This is such a cute book! I loved the time Garden that i bought two copies at the store and colored them BOTH. I might get another copy in fact. But this one is even better. I like the cat. And i like the message. The little girl who had a gazillion presents, wanted to share them with others. If you want to teach sharing, this is a good way to do it. Daria is such a great artist and writer. I hope she makes more!"
262,0,"The pictures work just fine as they are for images but they are not really suited for coloring pages. This has hundreds of tiny details for each page. Some are too small for a colored pencil. Furthermore, the images are basically monochrome themes. Hundreds of leaves on one tree, stars in a sky, boxes. Or a large wall on a house.  In summary I think the book is beautiful but it does not work for my purposes.  The book is clearly intended to be an illustration of a story. Perhaps the author could write in the story and forget referring to it as a coloring book."
263,0,"This book had more pages that I would consider coloring, compared to the “The Night Voyage book. After awhile it gets tedious to keep coloring buildings and tiny houses and big giant clocks and numberous details after details. Mandala drawerings are not my cup of tea but I felt it would be a change for me to try. I find it boring. Everywhere the little girl was in the picture I liked except pictures with millions of tiny houses"
264,0,OMG....
265,0,"This coloring book is wonderful from the beautiful pictures to the beautiful cover of the book; then you get a bonus,a poster thats what i call it."
266,0,I own over 50 coloring books and this is in my top three....
267,0,Im hoping you have other coloring books out on the market...
268,0,Now i have to go investagate..lol
269,0,God you do some wonderful art work.
270,0,"Wow! Todd Keisling does not disappoint. Ever since I heard this book was coming out, I’ve been anticipating a killer story and you know what, Todd delivered! Rock n Roll, Heavy Metal… what the Baptists have long called the Devil’s music. The Yellow Kings are on their way! The Final Reconciliation is the story of a band and what was to be their rise to fame."
271,0,"It’s been 30 years since that fateful night and as the only survivor, Aidan Cross the once lead guitarist of The Yellow Kings is ready to share his story with interviewer, Miles Hargrove. Entwined in the Carcosa Mythos our narrator, Aidan takes us down a dark path leading up to the tragic night that became the band’s final concert."
272,0,"Like a hundred other bands out there, The Yellow Kings were struggling to make a name for themselves, playing local gigs and hoping for that one big break. With Reggie Allen as their manager, they were beginning to get the exposure they craved, things were looking up and then Carmilla entered their lives."
273,0,"Carmilla, the gypsy, as Aidan liked to call her was the beginning of their end. Just another groupie wanting to get laid by the band they thought. But, Carmilla had another agenda, digging her claws into Johnny Leifthauser, the lead vocalist, Carmilla was along for the ride and oh what ride it was. Even Aidan’s niggling doubts weren’t enough to see her as she truly was until it was too late to turn back. By then, their fate had been sealed."
274,0,"Laid out like tracks of an album, the chapters take us through a journey with a heavy metal influence, all the way to the bitter twisted finale. The King in Yellow by Robert W Chambers has been influential in many stories throughout the decades since it was first published in 1895. Todd has done well in keeping the mythos alive with The Final Reconciliation. This is one story you do not want to miss!"
275,0,"This is my first read from Keisling.  It definitely won’t be my last.  He writes well and easy and doesn’t convolute his work with prose he thinks may impress, much like Koontz.  The topic within the pages culls from ideas born in the late 1800s by Robert W. Chambers.  Ashamedly, I was unfamiliar with Chambers’ King in Yellow mythos until Keisling breathed his own life into it with The Final Reconciliation--a modernized, rock & roll take on a dangerous and haunting idea.  The book reeks of Lovecraftian doom, which makes sense considering Lovecraft reeked of Chambers’ work, in particular with The King in Yellow."
276,0,"The listing’s own summary pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the book so I won’t rehash that here.  I will, however, tell you that fans of all things heavy metal, Lovecraft, and horror will feel very at home within these pages."
277,0,"While some may see the end coming from only one third of the way through, it doesn’t matter because of the way the book is built.  It presents itself in a way that teases you here and there about the ending, and though you may have come up with your own conclusion, you’re still enjoying the ride.  By the time the end starts to unfold and show its ugly face all knobs are turned to eleven and you’re in it for the long haul."
278,0,"The Final Reconciliation scratches a multitude of itches, some of which you may not know you had.  Oddly enough, the book made me miss my days of writing and recording with my bands and gave me a newfound appreciation for Paul, George, and Ringo."
279,0,"Metal band the Yellow Kings are on their first tour when they meet Camilla Bierce, the woman who will be their downfall..."
280,0,"I was tangentially aware of The King in Yellow for years after playing Call of Cthulhu: Horror Roleplaying and my interest was further piqued by True Detective. When I read the synopsis for this, I was all in."
281,0,"Told by the lone survivor of the band thirty years in the future, The Final Reconciliation is the tale of the disintegration of a band as they record an album, both personally and mentally as the walls of reality thin and fray. I knew they were screwed  when Camilla called Los Angeles Carcosa but the depth of the penetration was still pretty surprising."
282,0,"As the dreams and visions of red-robed faceless things in an alien golden city become more and more intense, things go so far off track the rails are no longer visible."
283,0,"The writing feels more like noir than horror, not a bad thing in my book. There's just enough foreshadowing in the narration to make you dread the ending that's barreling toward you. I had an idea about what Camilla's goal was fairly quickly but the ending was still a punch in the sternum."
284,0,"I've read other mythos stories involving musicians, Bleeding Shadows and Crawlin' Chaos Blues springing to mind, but The Final Reconciliation is the best so far. Five out of five Yellow Signs."
285,0,"One of the finest horror novels I've ever read. I don't know the Yellow King mythology, and epic prog metal is not really a musical genre I listen to, but I know good writing and better storytelling, and this is it. The characters are fantastic, and watching the whole thing begin to fray and reveal the horror beneath comes with as much inevitability for the characters as for readers. Minor dings for too frequent use of stylistic tics like ""I'll get to that"" or ""We'll get there,"" as well as the continued in-story-text reminder that its framework is an interview conducted by a Mr Hargrave (or Hargrove -- I've already forgotten), but in the end it successful enough in its effect that I'm willing to forgive."
286,0,"I've been on a bit of a novella kick the past six months. I've consumed titles by authors such as Laird Barron and Stephen Graham Jones, and for the most part loved every single one of them. So I was delighted to see author Todd Keisling continue this trend of excellence with The Final Reconciliation, a creepy and enthralling take on Chambers' Yellow King mythos."
287,0,"Told in an interview narrative, The Final Reconciliation tells the story of the Yellow Kings, a progressive metal band whose members, along with a couple of hundred other people, were horrifically killed a private performance of their first and only album. The lone survivor, band member and guitarist Aidan Cross, recounts in this interview the terrifying events that led up to that fateful night."
288,0,"I loved this novella. I loved it so much that I actually went back and read it all over again after finishing. The Final Reconciliation is a wonderful example of a story that builds slowly yet surely and culminates in an ending that will blow your skill sideways. The pacing is superb, and Keisling slowly draws you in deeper and deeper until you realise that it's too late to escape. The characterisation is on point, with the depictions of band members and the dynamics of the music industry authentic and fascinating. I genuinely felt like I was watching a biopic of the Yellow Kings as I read, and that they were a real band whose demise was a great mystery wrapped up with conspiracy theories (like the death of Tupac, or Elvis).  The inclusion of Camilla, a gypsy and groupie who drives wedges between the band members (like a modern day Yoko Ono or Courtney Love) was also brilliant, and I was terrified watching her manipulate the band members into performing a concert that would open a celestial gate and allow her entry into Carcosa."
289,0,"Speaking of Carcosa, I adored how Keisling weaved Hastur and the Yellow King mythos into this story. A creation of author Robert W. Chambers, the Yellow King has seen a resurgence in recents years (True Detective touched on a lot of this mythos in its first season) after living in the dark shadow of Lovecraft's Cthulhu for so long. And thank the gods it has, because Hastur is arguably more terrifying and confronting than Cthulhu. The imagery and horror that Keisling throws down before you in this novella will blow you away. There's plenty of sex, buckets of blood, and loads of unearthly tunes that transcend reality and take you to another place. Carcosa itself is terrifying, and Hastur and his minions will stay at the forefront of your mind long after finishing this story. The final performance of the Yellow Kings, where they unleash all of this hell, is both stunning and jaw dropping. In fact, Keisling does an amazing job conveying the idea that music transforms you and takes you on journeys both physical and spiritual. In the case of the Yellow Kings, this isn't always a good thing."
290,0,"The Final Reconciliation is a brilliant tale told with a wonderful voice. Keisling has nailed it, and I personally can't wait to read more from him. If you like music (especially metal or rock) and mythos fiction, then you'll love this story."
291,0,4.5 stars out of 5.
292,0,"Are you the sort of person who always has a song in their head?  Perhaps when you hear a few bars of an old song on the radio you are transported to a very specific time in your past.  Maybe you mark milestones in your life with the visual images of specific albums put out by your favourite groups.  I imagine Todd Keisling as that kind of person, too."
293,0,"In his book The Final Reconciliation, he presents a music documentary about a ""where is he now"" guitarist who is the only surviving member of a band that met a mysterious and tragic end.  As the scarred and grizzled guitarist tells his story we are transported to a time that embraced ear-ripping tunes, poetically cryptic lyrics, and the beloved concept album."
294,0,Reading it I was reminded of the work of Russian artist Anatole Krasnyansky with his surreal masked characters.  Except that his characters reflect joy.  Todd Keisling's characters reflect something much darker.
295,0,I recommend this book.
296,0,"The story as told by the protagonist, Aidan, has you wondering why he wasn't the lyricist. Excellent background, and of course the fore shadowing is in the title."
297,0,"Little by little, we are led to The Final Reconciliation, which gives the reader the urge to either scream or read more rapidly. As beloved was sleeping soundly next to me (how can he DO that when I am holding my breath to the point of taking deep gulping breaths when I could no longer hold it) I chose more rapidly, greedily sucking in the story until The Final Reconciliation."
298,0,"Excellent read. Completely pulls you in from the beginning. Absolutely no dead spots, complete drawing to the inescapable conclusion, which was absolutely not what I expected. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
299,0,Another spectacular read by Crystal Lake Publishing!
300,0,"First let me say that while I have heard the  name Robert W. Chambers, I have never read anything by him, nor was I at all familiar with ""The King in Yellow"" mythos."
301,0,"That having been said, Keisling has done a phenomenal job making sure none of that matters. Also, you do not have to be a fan of heavy metal to enjoy this story, but it definitely helps! ;-)"
302,0,"Told in an interview format, (with Tracks instead of Chapters) Keisling's visceral narrative is top-notch. He keeps you hanging with every word, and while you are riding the crescendo, you are simultaneously awaiting/dreading the build-up to the catylismic ending (and what an ending it is!)"
303,0,Highly recommended!
304,0,"Keisling always puts out a great story. But The Final Reconciliation goes above and beyond all else. I felt as if I were personally on the same cross country tour as the Yellow Kings, learning the ropes, fighting the fight, making the music that would ultimately lead us to producing an album like no other. An album that would change us and the world forever. If I didn't know Todd, I'd swear he had to be Aidan himself, the story was so vivid, so personal. As an author, he has truly taken off his mask at last."
305,0,I began reading this novella shortly after it was released at midnight and couldn’t put my phone down until I had finished two hours later. I was absorbed by the prose in the same way that the characters are absorbed by the progressive rock of the Yellow Kings. My retinas are still burning from staring at the screen for so long. The Final Reconciliation is one helluva story and what a pleasure it is to read. I don’t think anyone has done something so original with the King in Yellow mythos as Keisling has done with his novella. Keisling’s never been better and I can’t wait to read whatever strange and terrifying tale he crafts next!
306,0,"A continuation of David Hawkes' beautiful translation of the amazing 18th century Chinese novel begun in Volume I (The Golden Days).  This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call ""plot.""  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.  We get to experience the life of the Jia family and their relatives at the height of their success, before their inevitable decline.  This is, after all, Buddhist China, and in Buddhism, everything is about transience."
307,0,"It's kinda silly how much I loved reading this, when spoiled Chinese aristocrats writing poetry really ought to be boring. But then a scene comes along like Bao-chai and Dai-yu exchanging insults disguised as jokes, and Tan-chun speaks up:"
308,0,"'Pinch her lips, Chai!' she said. 'You should hear what she's been saying about you.'"
309,0,"'I don't need to,' said Bao-chai. 'One doesn't expect ivory from a dog's mouth!'"
310,0,"And I literally said out loud, ""Woof, girl!"" and kept on chugging along."
311,0,"Sure, I did miss the really weird parts of Volume I. So much nothing happens in this second volume. But that's okay, because there are also some tremendously tender moments of affection. Bao-yu doting on his maids to keep them warm; Xi-feng and Patience rigging a card game so Grandmother can win; Or Dai-yu taking Caltrop under her wing and making a real poet out of her. For all the back-biting these women and men in the Jia family do, they also express deep love in small, subtle ways."
312,0,"--But, boy, there's also some sudden and violent bursts of life in between. People die or get beaten within an inch of death, and we just move on to the next scene. Constantly moving on forward and forward, with a little growing tinge of melancholy left behind in the background. And it's that satisfying mix of fantasy, realism, sweetness, and godawful depression that makes me corny in love for this story."
313,0,"Compared to other translations of this book, this is by far the easiest, most comprehensible, and most fluid flowing translation out there. Even though it is an English translation, the translation captures the original's intent and purpose, without too much verbosity.  And what makes this translation stand out is its inclusion of an appendix that discusses in depth relevant historical facts that the reader may find useful or interesting as they read the novel."
314,0,"One complaint, the poems are not beautifully crafted and a lot of the original's subtle beauties are lost in translation. Both of these complaints are understandable. It is impossible to bring the greatness of this novel in its entirely from one language to another without losses. Though, It is a little sad not being able to fully absorb and enjoy everything the original has to offer. One possible solution, learn Chinese well enough to read the original in its mother language."
315,0,"The book arrived with so much protective packaging it could have survived a nuclear blast. Aside from its physical properties, the second volume was just as fun and exciting and detailed as the first. Can't wait to read the next 3 novels!"
316,0,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading ""Twilight"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng."

I read it in a class that covered the entire novel, but I've heard that many courses will teach selected chapters and even leave the entire second volume out!  Please don't pass this one up!  Character development is strong and the best poetry is in this volume."

Yes, it can be a boring set of books, but what you learn about pomp and prejudice makes it worthwhile. This volume describes day to day living in family communities."

325,0,This book is superb. I have read the Chinese version. Mr Hawkes' work is not only a translation but a gloss on the original text in modern language albeit in English.
326,0,"This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing."
327,0,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
328,0,"I have now read all three volumes of the David Hawkes' translation of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' and I am simply blown away by the sheer volume of the text, and how there is never a dull moment. Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."

331,0,Love the book and the series! It's a fascinating book and I highly suggest it. Can't wait to read it!
332,0,'Thank the Lord for that!' said Bao-yu fervently. 'If only she could shake it off altogether!'
333,0,Nightingale looked up at him with amusement:
334,0,'It's not often we hear you calling on the Lord.'
335,0,Bao-yu returned her smile:
336,0,'Any doctor will do in an emergency.'
337,0,"Man oh man, this is one bittersweet book, folks. It's the sunset of an era for the Jia family, and everyone and their dog knows it. Dai-yu, Bao-yu, Xi-feng, and nearly half of the characters are either sick or depressed. Anything not nailed down is being pawned off out the yinyang. Prospect Garden empties out its beautiful girls. Hell-- things are so bad, the servants can't even keep the damn gates locked at night. As Xi-feng bemoans when trying to bean-count the family's way out of bankruptcy, the Jias are slaves to their own past good fortunes and it's about time that the chickens come home to roost."
338,0,"To be frank, it doesn't have the spellbinding whimsy of the The Golden Days, or the splendorous atmosphere of The Crab-Flower Club. What The Warning Voice does have, however, is a helluva mood. True to its spirit of Taoism, the characters are liberated by their own true natures, and entrapped by spider webs of their own design:"
339,0,"In the first half, the girls of Prospect Garden explore their talents, their ambitions, and even their sexualities and genders. One girl pretends to be the wife of another girl until it feels real, while one of Bao-yu's servants begins to adopt a male persona. And both are treated with such wonder, sensitivity, and total lack of sensationalism that it sneaks up on you. But all it takes is some jealous and irrational busybodies, and next thing you know -- Bao-yu is wandering an empty garden."
340,0,"I wanted to yell at this book for how it puts these people, who I feel like I've known since they were boys and girls, through terrible misery. At the center of the impending disasters is Dai-yu, because like a flower, she is blooming into something beautiful -- and also very, very, very, VERY not long for this world. Bao-yu, meanwhile, is shaping up to be quite a sensitive, smart, and caring man...just in time to wave goodbye to her."
341,0,"The most bittersweet thing of it all is knowing there's two more volumes, and things must get worse before they get better. And it's bittersweet to move on without David Hawkes as the trusty translator, my companion through this foreign world (I sure hope the next volume explains why he stopped, because half the joy is cross-referencing his translation with the Chinese, and appreciating Hawkes's good sense and creativity). But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."
342,0,"I am an avid reader, approximately 100 books per year on a variety of topics and themes.  I have to say that The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger is one of the most unreadable books I have ever encountered.  I powered through over half of the book before I asked myself;  WTH am I spending my time reading this nonsense.  I will never attempt to finish this book due to the intense boredom of it.  I can't say more than that except don't waste your time."
343,0,Confusion and Unmoored Sufferings
344,0,"While reading this book, it almost seemed like the author was creating confusion and misery for misery and confusion’s sake!  Why would you do that in the first book of a series?  If Stephen King’s name wasn’t on this book, I sincerely doubt most readers would have finished reading it.  That said after completing the book I googled it and found King’s fans encouraging people to “power” through the book because book two is good, while on the same page I found others talking about underage sex that is weird in further editions of the series.  This leads me to one question:"
345,0,"“Why did you create such frivolous misery in your novel Mr. King?”  Apart from Jake, it just seems like pain that neither builds the character, nor furthers the story.  It is, to me, uninteresting and does nothing but sear and jade your reader’s imagination."
346,0,"This book was much less interesting than some less known/self-published smaller authors today like AC Cobble, Peter Flannery, A.G. Riddle and others.  In fact this being the first Stephen King book I’ve ever read, I was left wondering if the only reason he has been so popular was due to the advertisements of his brand over the years.  After all, prior to Amazon a writer could not easily get their works known or published.  I now wonder if King is really deserving of his lofty place amongst well known literary authors."
347,0,"The final quarter of this book from the flashback of Roland’s “coming of age” through the cave onward was decent and even good occasionally, but prior to that I wanted to stop reading the book several times."
348,0,"Maybe my review is unfair, but this doesn’t seem like a work worthy of one of the past century’s most popular authors.  Read it if you must, or just read the cliff’s notes version and save yourself some pointless misery."
349,0,"I don't understand the fascination with this series, much less Stephen King.  Most of his books end up with an alien monster.  This one ended up in the trash."
350,0,"Stephen King says he started his epic series, THE DARK TOWER, when he was a very young man. Perhaps with the arrogance and/or enthusiasm of youth this series is a mash-up of any number of literary traditions. In most hands it could have wound up a mess."
351,0,"THE GUNSLINGER, the first in the series, opens, appropriately enough, with “the gunslinger” chasing an unidentified man across a nameless desert:"
352,0,"“The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.”"
353,0,"The scene has the look and feel of an old spaghetti western, which King freely admits:"
354,0,“… I realized that what I wanted to write was a novel that contained Tolkien’s sense of quest and magic but set against Leone’s almost absurdly majestic Western backdrop.”
355,0,I think he succeeded:
356,0,"“The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way…”"
357,0,The Gunslinger (eventually we learn is name is Roland – an epic/mythic/heroic name) comes across a mysterious young man who has somehow been transported from (our) contemporary New York to this strange land. No attempt is made at explanation.
358,0,"When Roland comes to a town, we learn that this is post-apocalyptic time in which the world as we know it has been destroyed, possibly though nuclear war. It is a dystopian vision that predates the current popularity of such stories."
359,0,"As the journey continues, old-fashioned magic becomes part of the mix. Also a bit of derring do in the style of Indiana Jones. Also some fantasy in the vein of George R. R. Martin’s “Game of Thrones” (“Winter is coming.”)"
360,0,"And, of course, questions of good versus evil are explored."
361,0,Whew.
362,0,"Any type of cross-genre mixing is difficult to do well, much less on an epic scale. I have not even looked at subsequent books in the series in the hopes of being continually surprised when I do read them. I expect this volume is a good launch. If anybody could make it a success it would in the hands of Stephen King."
363,0,"There are many Stephen King books that I really enjoy (Salems Lot, Finders Keepers, The Stand, 11/22/63 just to name a few . . . in fact, 11/22/63 is one of my all-time favorite books).  As such, I really had high hopes for The Gunslinger.  However, the story line was disjointed, confusing, and not very enjoyable at all.  I kept expecting the flow of the book to smooth-out and become a ""cannot put down"" read.  However, this never occurred.  In the end, I was completely disappointed.  I have heard that other Dark Tower books are much better, but I disliked The Gunslinger so much that I'm not sure I'll read any others."
364,0,Once one of my all time favorite books.
365,0,"Stephen King revised this book and it is TERRIBLE!!!  You get no back story and don’t know who some of the characters are, how they played a roll in Roland’s life, what he went through to get to where he is now. NOTHING!!!  It is terrible!!"
366,0,"In terms of story, this is easily the best volume in the series so far. The characters and setting have so much depth, and we learn much about who they all are and why they've been thrust together on this ongoing, epic journey."
367,0,"And this story FEELS epic, too, as Roland and his band of unlikely heroes traverse miles and miles from the first page to the last. The setting and descriptions are all wonderful - you can see, hear, and smell everything the characters are... for good or ill, because some of the places the characters find themselves in are pretty bleak, to say the least."
368,0,"The only problem is that it ends on a cliffhanger. Which ordinarily, would be cause for an immediate one-star review from me, and a solemn vow to never read another book in the series. But because this is Stephen King, and because I've been mostly happy with the series so far, I'm going to press on and give it another shot."
369,0,"Then, the Kindle Edition I read is riddled with typos. Most of these are probably OCR issuess from scanning a print edition of this book, but it just smacks of plain laziness on the part of the publisher. I've reported them all as ""Quality Issues"" on Amazon."
370,0,Roland went for a walk in the desert.  He had a mule with no name.  Did he feel good to get out of the rain?  I can't remember  ...  the palaver left me too numb to care for his pain.
371,0,"This might be a useful introduction to an epic series,  but the story does not stand in its own."
372,0,"Reading this series again, after King finally concluded it - and though it's been over a decade since my first reading of the gunslinger's ka-tet, it's like my old friends have been waiting for my return. In this slice of the tale, the other characters start coming into their own and King draws his characters a deeper hue, layering meaning and darkening shadows."
373,0,"It's a tense ride, a fulfilling adventure and page-turner that starts to eat away at your sleeping hours. Be warned, I think these pages are laced with some addictive substance...maybe Eddie's been at it again. I can't stop reading this series."
374,0,"I know these are supposed to be the great Stephen King epic, but after three books and NOTHING happening I give up. I don't even care about the characters and he has spent 3 books developing them. He is constantly making references to the pop culture of the 1980s so I,m guessing in 10 years or so no one will know what he's talking about. There are better books to read I'm done."
375,0,"""The notebook"" was ordered for my wife after she saw the movie. She says that she rates it five stars."
376,0,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
377,0,I bought this for a friend after reading my copy of the 1975 (I think) edition with the pages turning yellow. It's like medicine. Everyone who struggles with the idea that God is a God of love should read this. Excellent Biblical perspective on how God's love can be known even in the painful experiences of life. Why God's love isn't obvious on the basis of casual observation. Impossible to understand without faith in Jesus Christ.
378,0,"I feel like this is a preacher who is preaching the deep, meat of the Lord's heart.....Oswald Chambers is my favorite!  Every paragraph has a compelling and truthful thought."
379,0,Oswald Chambers teachings are always challenging but the challenge is always good to bring us back to the word of God.
380,0,Fabulous book. I've read it three times and keep reading it. Oswald Chambers was really a wonderful godly man. Very deep
381,0,Oswald chambers has taught me a depth of the he bible that has been astoundingly beautiful. He is the one person including his precious wife that I can't wait tp see I'm heaven. His love of Christ and his devotion to our Lord is sweet fragrance of heaven!
382,0,As usual Oswald makes you think!!
383,0,Anything O Chambers writes is dynamite
384,0,Great amounts of wisdom in this book. Oswald never disappoints with his writing. Definitely worth a read and definitely a book I will read multiple times throughout life!
385,0,"Awesome book, and anything Oswald Chambers writes is annointed by the Holy Spirit. You will see a man dying to flesh to write HIS heart out."
386,0,I love anything by Oswald Chambers and it makes an excellent gift for anyone that needs an insight to the word of God.

420,0,Excellent book!  An encouraging read!
421,0,I love all of Oswald Chambers books and this was no exception.
422,0,"Wow! Todd Keisling does not disappoint. Ever since I heard this book was coming out, I’ve been anticipating a killer story and you know what, Todd delivered! Rock n Roll, Heavy Metal… what the Baptists have long called the Devil’s music. The Yellow Kings are on their way! The Final Reconciliation is the story of a band and what was to be their rise to fame."
423,0,"It’s been 30 years since that fateful night and as the only survivor, Aidan Cross the once lead guitarist of The Yellow Kings is ready to share his story with interviewer, Miles Hargrove. Entwined in the Carcosa Mythos our narrator, Aidan takes us down a dark path leading up to the tragic night that became the band’s final concert."
424,0,"Like a hundred other bands out there, The Yellow Kings were struggling to make a name for themselves, playing local gigs and hoping for that one big break. With Reggie Allen as their manager, they were beginning to get the exposure they craved, things were looking up and then Carmilla entered their lives."
425,0,"Carmilla, the gypsy, as Aidan liked to call her was the beginning of their end. Just another groupie wanting to get laid by the band they thought. But, Carmilla had another agenda, digging her claws into Johnny Leifthauser, the lead vocalist, Carmilla was along for the ride and oh what ride it was. Even Aidan’s niggling doubts weren’t enough to see her as she truly was until it was too late to turn back. By then, their fate had been sealed."
426,0,"Laid out like tracks of an album, the chapters take us through a journey with a heavy metal influence, all the way to the bitter twisted finale. The King in Yellow by Robert W Chambers has been influential in many stories throughout the decades since it was first published in 1895. Todd has done well in keeping the mythos alive with The Final Reconciliation. This is one story you do not want to miss!"
427,0,"This is my first read from Keisling.  It definitely won’t be my last.  He writes well and easy and doesn’t convolute his work with prose he thinks may impress, much like Koontz.  The topic within the pages culls from ideas born in the late 1800s by Robert W. Chambers.  Ashamedly, I was unfamiliar with Chambers’ King in Yellow mythos until Keisling breathed his own life into it with The Final Reconciliation--a modernized, rock & roll take on a dangerous and haunting idea.  The book reeks of Lovecraftian doom, which makes sense considering Lovecraft reeked of Chambers’ work, in particular with The King in Yellow."
428,0,"The listing’s own summary pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the book so I won’t rehash that here.  I will, however, tell you that fans of all things heavy metal, Lovecraft, and horror will feel very at home within these pages."
429,0,"While some may see the end coming from only one third of the way through, it doesn’t matter because of the way the book is built.  It presents itself in a way that teases you here and there about the ending, and though you may have come up with your own conclusion, you’re still enjoying the ride.  By the time the end starts to unfold and show its ugly face all knobs are turned to eleven and you’re in it for the long haul."
430,0,"The Final Reconciliation scratches a multitude of itches, some of which you may not know you had.  Oddly enough, the book made me miss my days of writing and recording with my bands and gave me a newfound appreciation for Paul, George, and Ringo."
431,0,"Metal band the Yellow Kings are on their first tour when they meet Camilla Bierce, the woman who will be their downfall..."
432,0,"I was tangentially aware of The King in Yellow for years after playing Call of Cthulhu: Horror Roleplaying and my interest was further piqued by True Detective. When I read the synopsis for this, I was all in."
433,0,"Told by the lone survivor of the band thirty years in the future, The Final Reconciliation is the tale of the disintegration of a band as they record an album, both personally and mentally as the walls of reality thin and fray. I knew they were screwed  when Camilla called Los Angeles Carcosa but the depth of the penetration was still pretty surprising."
434,0,"As the dreams and visions of red-robed faceless things in an alien golden city become more and more intense, things go so far off track the rails are no longer visible."
435,0,"The writing feels more like noir than horror, not a bad thing in my book. There's just enough foreshadowing in the narration to make you dread the ending that's barreling toward you. I had an idea about what Camilla's goal was fairly quickly but the ending was still a punch in the sternum."
436,0,"I've read other mythos stories involving musicians, Bleeding Shadows and Crawlin' Chaos Blues springing to mind, but The Final Reconciliation is the best so far. Five out of five Yellow Signs."
437,0,"One of the finest horror novels I've ever read. I don't know the Yellow King mythology, and epic prog metal is not really a musical genre I listen to, but I know good writing and better storytelling, and this is it. The characters are fantastic, and watching the whole thing begin to fray and reveal the horror beneath comes with as much inevitability for the characters as for readers. Minor dings for too frequent use of stylistic tics like ""I'll get to that"" or ""We'll get there,"" as well as the continued in-story-text reminder that its framework is an interview conducted by a Mr Hargrave (or Hargrove -- I've already forgotten), but in the end it successful enough in its effect that I'm willing to forgive."
438,0,"I've been on a bit of a novella kick the past six months. I've consumed titles by authors such as Laird Barron and Stephen Graham Jones, and for the most part loved every single one of them. So I was delighted to see author Todd Keisling continue this trend of excellence with The Final Reconciliation, a creepy and enthralling take on Chambers' Yellow King mythos."
439,0,"Told in an interview narrative, The Final Reconciliation tells the story of the Yellow Kings, a progressive metal band whose members, along with a couple of hundred other people, were horrifically killed a private performance of their first and only album. The lone survivor, band member and guitarist Aidan Cross, recounts in this interview the terrifying events that led up to that fateful night."
440,0,"I loved this novella. I loved it so much that I actually went back and read it all over again after finishing. The Final Reconciliation is a wonderful example of a story that builds slowly yet surely and culminates in an ending that will blow your skill sideways. The pacing is superb, and Keisling slowly draws you in deeper and deeper until you realise that it's too late to escape. The characterisation is on point, with the depictions of band members and the dynamics of the music industry authentic and fascinating. I genuinely felt like I was watching a biopic of the Yellow Kings as I read, and that they were a real band whose demise was a great mystery wrapped up with conspiracy theories (like the death of Tupac, or Elvis).  The inclusion of Camilla, a gypsy and groupie who drives wedges between the band members (like a modern day Yoko Ono or Courtney Love) was also brilliant, and I was terrified watching her manipulate the band members into performing a concert that would open a celestial gate and allow her entry into Carcosa."
441,0,"Speaking of Carcosa, I adored how Keisling weaved Hastur and the Yellow King mythos into this story. A creation of author Robert W. Chambers, the Yellow King has seen a resurgence in recents years (True Detective touched on a lot of this mythos in its first season) after living in the dark shadow of Lovecraft's Cthulhu for so long. And thank the gods it has, because Hastur is arguably more terrifying and confronting than Cthulhu. The imagery and horror that Keisling throws down before you in this novella will blow you away. There's plenty of sex, buckets of blood, and loads of unearthly tunes that transcend reality and take you to another place. Carcosa itself is terrifying, and Hastur and his minions will stay at the forefront of your mind long after finishing this story. The final performance of the Yellow Kings, where they unleash all of this hell, is both stunning and jaw dropping. In fact, Keisling does an amazing job conveying the idea that music transforms you and takes you on journeys both physical and spiritual. In the case of the Yellow Kings, this isn't always a good thing."
442,0,"The Final Reconciliation is a brilliant tale told with a wonderful voice. Keisling has nailed it, and I personally can't wait to read more from him. If you like music (especially metal or rock) and mythos fiction, then you'll love this story."
443,0,4.5 stars out of 5.
444,0,"Are you the sort of person who always has a song in their head?  Perhaps when you hear a few bars of an old song on the radio you are transported to a very specific time in your past.  Maybe you mark milestones in your life with the visual images of specific albums put out by your favourite groups.  I imagine Todd Keisling as that kind of person, too."
445,0,"In his book The Final Reconciliation, he presents a music documentary about a ""where is he now"" guitarist who is the only surviving member of a band that met a mysterious and tragic end.  As the scarred and grizzled guitarist tells his story we are transported to a time that embraced ear-ripping tunes, poetically cryptic lyrics, and the beloved concept album."
446,0,Reading it I was reminded of the work of Russian artist Anatole Krasnyansky with his surreal masked characters.  Except that his characters reflect joy.  Todd Keisling's characters reflect something much darker.
447,0,I recommend this book.
448,0,"The story as told by the protagonist, Aidan, has you wondering why he wasn't the lyricist. Excellent background, and of course the fore shadowing is in the title."
449,0,"Little by little, we are led to The Final Reconciliation, which gives the reader the urge to either scream or read more rapidly. As beloved was sleeping soundly next to me (how can he DO that when I am holding my breath to the point of taking deep gulping breaths when I could no longer hold it) I chose more rapidly, greedily sucking in the story until The Final Reconciliation."
450,0,"Excellent read. Completely pulls you in from the beginning. Absolutely no dead spots, complete drawing to the inescapable conclusion, which was absolutely not what I expected. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
451,0,Another spectacular read by Crystal Lake Publishing!
452,0,"First let me say that while I have heard the  name Robert W. Chambers, I have never read anything by him, nor was I at all familiar with ""The King in Yellow"" mythos."
453,0,"That having been said, Keisling has done a phenomenal job making sure none of that matters. Also, you do not have to be a fan of heavy metal to enjoy this story, but it definitely helps! ;-)"
454,0,"Told in an interview format, (with Tracks instead of Chapters) Keisling's visceral narrative is top-notch. He keeps you hanging with every word, and while you are riding the crescendo, you are simultaneously awaiting/dreading the build-up to the catylismic ending (and what an ending it is!)"
455,0,Highly recommended!
456,0,"Keisling always puts out a great story. But The Final Reconciliation goes above and beyond all else. I felt as if I were personally on the same cross country tour as the Yellow Kings, learning the ropes, fighting the fight, making the music that would ultimately lead us to producing an album like no other. An album that would change us and the world forever. If I didn't know Todd, I'd swear he had to be Aidan himself, the story was so vivid, so personal. As an author, he has truly taken off his mask at last."
457,0,I began reading this novella shortly after it was released at midnight and couldn’t put my phone down until I had finished two hours later. I was absorbed by the prose in the same way that the characters are absorbed by the progressive rock of the Yellow Kings. My retinas are still burning from staring at the screen for so long. The Final Reconciliation is one helluva story and what a pleasure it is to read. I don’t think anyone has done something so original with the King in Yellow mythos as Keisling has done with his novella. Keisling’s never been better and I can’t wait to read whatever strange and terrifying tale he crafts next!
458,0,This complete version is very nicely edited and printed. Cover design is all good. Free shipment to home is very convenient. Little heavy due the thickness (500 pages) but it's okay if you don't carry it in your journey or in your dreams.
459,0,"I like reading new takes on traditional fairy tales and this collection by Angela Carter was hair-raising and irreverently funny. Carter gives a modern twist to ten old tales like those of Bluebeard, Little Red Riding Hood and Beauty and the Beast. The stories are written in strong, vivid prose that brings them to life and makes them read like cliff-hangers. Carter’s writing has a bold, sexually suggestive edge that makes more explicit the sexual subtext of the originals. “The Bloody Chamber” is a pulse-racing revision of the Bluebeard legend, and “Puss in Boots” had me laughing out loud at the bravado of the randy old cat."
460,0,"Some of my favorite women writers (Emma Donoghue and Sarah Waters, for instance) cite the English writer Angela Carter as a big influence on their writing. Ms. Carter passed away at age 51 in 1992. I’ve wanted to explore her writing and this short story collection was a great place to start. I look forward to reading some of her other stories and novels.  Emma Donoghue, by the way, wrote her own feminist version of fairy tales called "
461,0,. It has a very different tone from this book by Carter but anyone who likes this would probably enjoy reading Donoghue's book as well.
462,0,"I love the writing of  Angela carter.  These retelling of fairy tales offers a glimpse of what is concealed.  Here is why girls are warned not to walk through the woods.  Wolves yes; human potentials to harm, human potential for teeth; it is honest bold, stepped of veneers that cover up truths some do not want exposed, but this is really who we are.  Angela Carter's mirror system is dead-on accurate.  Everything you did not want to know, but suspected.  And in the ""Bloody Chamber,"" Angela Carter is not afraid to tell it with brilliance and charm; it all seems regal.  Full of exuberance for the ragged existences necessary for happiness and authentic  passion: it bites."
463,0,I didn't know a lot going into this book. Had never read anything by Angela Carter before.
464,0,"First off, this writing is SEXY. Second, the audio book version is even SEXIER(the narrators Emilia Fox and Richard Armitage are beautiful choices)."
465,0,These tales are retellings of classic fairytales and it takes them back to the more gothic-y horror feel that they originated with.
466,0,I originally go this as an audio book and LOVED IT! So then I purchased this 75th Anniversary Edition to keep on my shelf. I reread it as soon as I got it. Her writing is absolutely beautiful.
467,0,"I'm only giving it 5 stars because the messages conveyed and how well written it is. However, I'm not a fan of the material nearly as much as I wanted to be. I understand that feminist novelists need to emphasize characteristics that break away from androcentrism, but I can do without the heavy sexually explicit scenes of most stories in this book. It's just personal taste, not a judgment on quality. Angela Carter is amazing and has helped usher many minds in a positive direction. My support goes to the cause and her writing."
468,0,"For years, since I heard of the works of the late Angela Carter, I've wanted to get this book in my hands. Some time ago, I managed to obtain a digital copy of it, and after reading it over and over, I knew I had to buy it."
469,0,"However, because this book is virtually impossible to buy in my country, I had to search it here, and for some reason, the cover arts I saw in other edition weren't my cup of tea. This one, on the other hand, caught my eye as soon as I saw it. The wraparound art is gorgeousm, and I lamented that the book didn't include illustrations for the stories, which are still as enjoyable as when I read them for the first time."
470,0,"On the stories themselves: As many reviewers (and Carter herself) said: these stories are not adaptations of classic fairy tales (from Perrault and the Brothers Grimm with some european folklore, to be exact) but more like clever revisitations of them, written with a rich, sometimes baroque (perhaps too ornamented for some readers) language, where one is transported not just to the tales themselves, but to Carter's world: a realm where young girls become aware of themselves as sexual and self-sufficient beings, where beasts (specially wolves) can be husbands or lovers, where mothers and pets are saviors, and where blood runs like water."
471,0,"Yes, The Bloody Chamber may be considered as feminist fiction, but don't be scared, those of you who fear the F-word: While Carter was a feminist, she was one that didn't take herself seriously to the point of being Politically Correct or pretending to create a thin-veiled pamphlet with The Bloody Chamber; in fact, many of the words and situations in her stories might upset of the most sensitive readers (violent sex, explicit sex, nudity, necrophilia, animal and human escathology, and of course murder), and even those readers who aren't into any wave of feminism may enjoy several of the stories. After all, the works of Carter inspired several famous writers nowadays, such as Neil Gaiman, J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie, Kelly Link (who wrote the foreword to this Anniversary Edition) among many others."
472,0,"There is one negative detail I must mention for those who want to buy this edition: When mine arrived, the edges of some of the pages weren't smooth but with a rough texture, like from a pulp edition (Mind you, the pages themselves were okay, the printed words looked in good conditions, the diagramation was in order, and none of them was torn). So, if you are fastidious with details like these when you order a book, you may want to think twice before buying it online, and going to a bookstore and checking the pages yourself instead."
473,0,"Other than that, The Bloody Chamber is the best and most known of Angela Carter's work on fiction, so if you like fantasy stories with the dark edge that characterized old fairytales, you can it give it a try."
474,0,"I'll admit that I was a somewhat reluctant reader of The Bloody Chamber. I'd purchased it for a class and then ended up not needing to read it. I have a strange personal tradition, though, of reading one piece of horror fiction at Christmas time (a tradition that began in junior high when I happened to read J. Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla--a vampire tale that Carter references in The Bloody Chamber), and when this was what I had on the shelf come Christmas-time, I gave it a go."
475,0,"I'll admit, too, that I was a little ambivalent about it when I began the first couple of stories. The stories tend to follow a pattern of opening with a long flood of elaborate, creepy descriptions before finally moving on to the story, and the language throughout the collection is not difficult, but is allusive, sometimes tortuous, and always ornate. It all, to be honest, felt overwritten."
476,0,"But at the same time, after slogging through the opening of the first couple stories, I would reach the ending to find that the story opened up and culminated in something that was just startling. I won't give away any endings, but many of them, such as ""The Werewolf"" and ""The Tiger's Bride,"" leave you with images that shock your intellect, and linger. And some of them, such as ""The Bloody Chamber"" and ""The Courtship of Mr Lyon,"" end just beautifully. ""The Bloody Chamber,"" especially, ends thrillingly, with the women of the story rejecting the passive roles typically assigned to them in fairy tales (this one based on Blue Beard) and washing the story in a beautiful bath of blood, in the process reshaping and reconstituting their community."
477,0,"By the end of the book, Carter had totally won me over, and The Bloody Chamber's aspects that had seemed overwritten, instead, felt right. It felt like Carter had word-by-word constructed a concrete aesthetic world, an enormous gothic mansion complete with more than a few torture chambers and plenty of hidden passages still there to be explored. The Bloody Chamber was a fantastic book that I expect to enjoy even more on future readings."
478,0,"Angela Carter set out for the odd task of rewriting fairy tales as (mostly) horror stories with a feminist slant.  She succeeds quite well, with most stories in here being great and even the low points being pretty good.  Probably the best versions of both the Bluebeard and Puss in Boots stories ever put to paper."
479,0,"It's brisk read, and a classic for a reason.  Check it out."
480,0,"Angela Carter died far too soon, at the age of 55, but she left behind this astonishing collection of tales (her choice of words) inspired by a lifelong love of fairy and folktales, first heard from her Scottish grandmother.  Carter's artistry dazzles, delights, and disturbs; she brings to the surface the latent erotic content of many traditional fairytales and subverts their didactic messages.  (For example, the tale of Bluebeard on which Carter's title story is based, was intended to teach young woman the dangers of ""female curiosity,"" while apparently unconcerned with the need to comment on the dangers of ""male homicidal impulses."")  But have no fear:  Carter never grinds her axes--her wonderful stories are meant first of all to enthrall and to entertain in the best sense of that word.  It's the 75th anniversary of her birth and Penguin has come out with a new commemorative edition of this unforgettable collection of short fiction:  no better time to become acquainted with one of the greatest fabulists who ever lived--I only wish she could have gone on writing for decades longer."
481,0,"I bought this for class. The professor LOVES this author. I haven't enjoyed the stories very much, really don't see the appeal here, but if you like twists on classic fairy tales then you may enjoy this. Some of the stories, I just didn't get, and the professor admitted she didn't either. Still, she loves this author and everything she writes."
482,0,"Although adult reworkings of fairy tales are a dime a dozen today, Carter’s collection which helped launch the sub genre is well worth the read. I researched the originals and found that for many the horrific touch was more a restoration than alteration... many of our most beloved and seemingly innocent fairy tales have darker roots. Sex and death are at times at variance and at other times in collusion, and female agency saves the day in a number of the stories... no trembling distressed damsels here! On top of all this, Carter’s prose is beautiful, loaded with stunning imagery."
483,0,"""The notebook"" was ordered for my wife after she saw the movie. She says that she rates it five stars."
484,0,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
485,0,"Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding ""Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad."""
486,0,...ah! I love learning about other cultures!
487,0,"But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly (""Who the heck is this person again?"" I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time."
488,0,"Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him)."
489,0,"But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work...."
490,0,...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.
491,0,"This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China (""Red Studies,"" from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, ""A Dream of Red Mansions""). It really should be read by every educated person."
492,0,"  The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however."
493,0,"  I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature."
494,0,"  The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note."
495,0,"  First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women)."
496,0,"  Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses."
497,0,"  Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead."
498,0,"  Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure."
499,0,"  Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others."
500,0,  There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.
501,0,"  Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia."
502,0,"For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West (Americas, Europe) it might be a chore to get interested in this book. The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you. If you're interested in how life was lived in that part of the world, this book will be a masterpiece, as it has been in China itself."
503,0,"One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature.  Five volumes and hundreds of characters. Has a modern feel, despite being more than two hundred years old. Fascinating book."
504,0,"Rank and privilege in 18th century China. The family compound. Relation between relatives and the pecking order. The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs. Subjection of women is rife, but not without protest. This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived.  This is not a history book, it is a novel of customs, more about  what people thought, about respect, subservience and privilege  and mores."
505,0,"One of the 4 classics of Chinese literature, it is a riveting and interesting read! Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature. Highly recommended."
506,0,The book looks very aged/old with yellow pages. Disappointed
507,0,This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature. The English translation here is very good. Even the poetry is well done
508,0,"The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read)."
509,0,A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.
510,0,Excellent book!  An encouraging read!
511,0,I love all of Oswald Chambers books and this was no exception.
512,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
513,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
514,0,This book is superb. I have read the Chinese version. Mr Hawkes' work is not only a translation but a gloss on the original text in modern language albeit in English.
515,0,"This is an awesome book.  It is one of a famous trilogy that I happened upon while I was searching for Judge Dee mysteries.  It is magical, marvelous, and absorbing."
516,0,"It is fantastic. As we know it almost impossible to translate a classical Chinese novel into English without a 100% understanding of the Chinese culture and history. I have read the Chinese edition of this novel twice and I have been looking for an English translation of the novel, this one satisfies me quite well."
517,0,"I have now read all three volumes of the David Hawkes' translation of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber' and I am simply blown away by the sheer volume of the text, and how there is never a dull moment. Not only is it a beautiful love story, but it is also a semi autobiographical account of the rise and fall of Cao Wue-Qin's family. I love modern Chinese writers like Mo Yan and Yu Hua, but I must say this novel is a must read for anyone wishing to understand Chinese Literature. My wife is Chinese and she knows this work from her days in school, and she said that it must have been very hard to translate the old Chinese into Modern English, but I would say that Mr. Hawkes' version is true and as close as one can get to an excellent translation of an enormous tome. I would just stick to these 3 volumes with the 80 chapters - and enjoy. This is truly a great piece of world literature that should be read."
518,0,Don't miss this series.
519,0,Excellent edition with all three in new shape.
520,0,Love the book and the series! It's a fascinating book and I highly suggest it. Can't wait to read it!
521,0,'Thank the Lord for that!' said Bao-yu fervently. 'If only she could shake it off altogether!'
522,0,Nightingale looked up at him with amusement:
523,0,'It's not often we hear you calling on the Lord.'
524,0,Bao-yu returned her smile:
525,0,'Any doctor will do in an emergency.'
526,0,"Man oh man, this is one bittersweet book, folks. It's the sunset of an era for the Jia family, and everyone and their dog knows it. Dai-yu, Bao-yu, Xi-feng, and nearly half of the characters are either sick or depressed. Anything not nailed down is being pawned off out the yinyang. Prospect Garden empties out its beautiful girls. Hell-- things are so bad, the servants can't even keep the damn gates locked at night. As Xi-feng bemoans when trying to bean-count the family's way out of bankruptcy, the Jias are slaves to their own past good fortunes and it's about time that the chickens come home to roost."
527,0,"To be frank, it doesn't have the spellbinding whimsy of the The Golden Days, or the splendorous atmosphere of The Crab-Flower Club. What The Warning Voice does have, however, is a helluva mood. True to its spirit of Taoism, the characters are liberated by their own true natures, and entrapped by spider webs of their own design:"
528,0,"In the first half, the girls of Prospect Garden explore their talents, their ambitions, and even their sexualities and genders. One girl pretends to be the wife of another girl until it feels real, while one of Bao-yu's servants begins to adopt a male persona. And both are treated with such wonder, sensitivity, and total lack of sensationalism that it sneaks up on you. But all it takes is some jealous and irrational busybodies, and next thing you know -- Bao-yu is wandering an empty garden."
529,0,"I wanted to yell at this book for how it puts these people, who I feel like I've known since they were boys and girls, through terrible misery. At the center of the impending disasters is Dai-yu, because like a flower, she is blooming into something beautiful -- and also very, very, very, VERY not long for this world. Bao-yu, meanwhile, is shaping up to be quite a sensitive, smart, and caring man...just in time to wave goodbye to her."
530,0,"The most bittersweet thing of it all is knowing there's two more volumes, and things must get worse before they get better. And it's bittersweet to move on without David Hawkes as the trusty translator, my companion through this foreign world (I sure hope the next volume explains why he stopped, because half the joy is cross-referencing his translation with the Chinese, and appreciating Hawkes's good sense and creativity). But I've gone this far -- it's a crime to not follow Cao Xueqin and his jade-boy Bao-yu to wherever in Heaven or on Earth they're heading."
531,0,"As the SF Opera was featuring an adaptation, I decided to read the Kindle so-called ""abridged"" version of this classic. While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."
532,0,"Be advised, due to type font it's 3 times as long as regular Kindle books of this size. It take's between 1 and 2 hours to read a chapter and there are 56 of them!"
533,0,"Children's book rather than the authentic, adult version classic. Buyer be ware!"
534,0,Bad translation. I have heard great things about this story but could not get past the poor translation.
535,0,"Reminds me of Jane Austin. Interesting peak into Chinese society. Well Ming era anyway.The 2nd book maybe better, I hope."
536,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
537,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
538,0,The Hawkes translation 
539,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
540,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
541,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
542,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
543,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
544,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
545,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
546,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
547,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
548,0,"I have been reading a great deal of Urban Fantasy, and I was very much up for a change of pace. This really hit the spot, as they say. I felt like the characters were cohesive, complex and shown to the reader from enough angles to make them feel alive and real. While they all spoke in the flowery speech considered polite, it was easy to tell their personalities from their particular speech habits. I am often cut-throat in my reviews about dialogue so it's refreshing to be able to compliment, not critique it in a review."
549,0,"The best thing about this book was not the plot -- because this is a fairly old work the plot has many of the tropes we readers come to expect from this sort of work. They may seem cliched now because so many newer works have aped them. However, the descriptions are astounding -- detailed and precise yet not overlong or exhausting. It always maintains the perfect level to engross and trap the reader but not bore them. The 'movie' in my head was awash with wonderful detail, lush backgrounds and perfect costumes. I really haven't read description this good in a very long time."
550,0,"However, the one thing I didn't care for was the three or four incidents of anachronism stew. Xifeng had a wrist watch centuries before they came into fashion, Baochai had a few too many modernisms in her speech and  the Chinese manners of gift-giving were ignored, possibly to make the work more appropriate for a western audience. If these had not stuck out of the narratives like sudden blotches of bright paint on a somber renaissance portrait, this would have been five stars. UPDATE -- the author has taken the time to address this paragraph in the comments. Please read her replies as they explain a great deal."
551,0,"This is a translation....so there is usually some loss of understanding.  The book is massively long and the names of the characters are very confusing.  In the front of the book they give a geneology map...you've got to be kidding...no way to keep track....just keep on reading.  It does give a great description of the class system, the mores, and the discrimination that was present. However...I found it to be  an exhausting book to read  and I lost interest in the characters"
552,0,One of the best books I've read about China during that time frame. I was able to relate to the different characters even though they were totally out of my frame of reference. I had sympathy for the various chactacters and the author

554,0,"Historical novel I am learning much about the period, the place, the history, and how it affected those people that lived through it. I will not soon forget this wonderful novel. I am so glad that this author re-wrote this historical novel and made it simpler for the present readers. it must have been a difficult undertaking and I can see from Pauline Chen's impressive degrees that she truly was in a position to write such an intelligent book. Please write more!!!"
555,0,I consider this story a fan fiction based on the original rather than a abridged version of the original considering the number of characters the author either kills off at the beginning or allowed to live till the end.
556,0,The bad: It is written in present tense. Why did the author do this? It makes reading it more awkward. Four stars if it had not been written in present tense. Seems common for debut authors for some reason.
557,0,"The good: It's an interesting, easy to read version of a very long plodding confusing classic. Her version of the ending is mostly believable (except the epilogue!) and the characters are well drawn if perhaps seemingly a bit different from the original."
558,0,"Read this and then read the five volume version, you'll appreciated both more."
559,0,I've been reading various versions and translations of  A Dream of Red Chambers since the mid 70's and approached this book with some trepidation. Well I enjoyed it so much I bought the audio book (which brought came with the extra bonus of learning the correct pronounciation of charactar's names) and have listened several times over which then leads to a re-reading of the original:-)
560,0,BTW a set of unabridged audio books of ADoRC would be worth the expense...
561,0,There were too many characters with names that I couldn't even pretend to sound out. The book was too long then just ended. I did not enjoy this book
562,0,"suggest you read this book of you have an interest in China, it's customs and politics. The love stories may make this book appeal more to women."
563,0,"I think this novel may have been received better had Chen creditted the Red Chamber rather than fashion this book as a retelling. The closed world of a family in standing within the classical world of its Emporors, feels like a peeping with Daiyu into a secret world.  I am intrigued with the linked lives of the women of this world and how they live out their lives often within a few rooms. Despite its failure to stand alone as ""The"" Red Chamber, Chen has brought us to a different way of seeing the world"
564,0,"I have never read Dream of the Red Chamber but decided to pick up this novel as a condensed version of the aforementioned.  Pauline Chen's The Red Chamber is a captivating read from the get-go, especially in that it provides the right balance of historical context while not detracting from the depths of the main characters.  Some may be unhappy at the changes that have been made in this novel, but if it's taken as a separated, individual novel rather than a reworking of the classic, it will prove to be an enjoyable read.  I was caught up in the novel to the point that I was in tears by the end."
565,0,"Descriptive, thought provoking, emotional. Very easy to read and I literally could not put the book down. The names of the characters took a little getting used to, but I soon got familiar with them. Highly recommend."
566,0,"A continuation of David Hawkes' beautiful translation of the amazing 18th century Chinese novel begun in Volume I (The Golden Days).  This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call ""plot.""  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.  We get to experience the life of the Jia family and their relatives at the height of their success, before their inevitable decline.  This is, after all, Buddhist China, and in Buddhism, everything is about transience."
567,0,"It's kinda silly how much I loved reading this, when spoiled Chinese aristocrats writing poetry really ought to be boring. But then a scene comes along like Bao-chai and Dai-yu exchanging insults disguised as jokes, and Tan-chun speaks up:"
568,0,"'Pinch her lips, Chai!' she said. 'You should hear what she's been saying about you.'"
569,0,"'I don't need to,' said Bao-chai. 'One doesn't expect ivory from a dog's mouth!'"
570,0,"And I literally said out loud, ""Woof, girl!"" and kept on chugging along."
571,0,"Sure, I did miss the really weird parts of Volume I. So much nothing happens in this second volume. But that's okay, because there are also some tremendously tender moments of affection. Bao-yu doting on his maids to keep them warm; Xi-feng and Patience rigging a card game so Grandmother can win; Or Dai-yu taking Caltrop under her wing and making a real poet out of her. For all the back-biting these women and men in the Jia family do, they also express deep love in small, subtle ways."
572,0,"--But, boy, there's also some sudden and violent bursts of life in between. People die or get beaten within an inch of death, and we just move on to the next scene. Constantly moving on forward and forward, with a little growing tinge of melancholy left behind in the background. And it's that satisfying mix of fantasy, realism, sweetness, and godawful depression that makes me corny in love for this story."
573,0,"Compared to other translations of this book, this is by far the easiest, most comprehensible, and most fluid flowing translation out there. Even though it is an English translation, the translation captures the original's intent and purpose, without too much verbosity.  And what makes this translation stand out is its inclusion of an appendix that discusses in depth relevant historical facts that the reader may find useful or interesting as they read the novel."
574,0,"One complaint, the poems are not beautifully crafted and a lot of the original's subtle beauties are lost in translation. Both of these complaints are understandable. It is impossible to bring the greatness of this novel in its entirely from one language to another without losses. Though, It is a little sad not being able to fully absorb and enjoy everything the original has to offer. One possible solution, learn Chinese well enough to read the original in its mother language."
575,0,"The book arrived with so much protective packaging it could have survived a nuclear blast. Aside from its physical properties, the second volume was just as fun and exciting and detailed as the first. Can't wait to read the next 3 novels!"
576,0,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading ""Twilight"" or ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng."

579,0,"This is my favorite volume of Honglou meng.  I read it in a class that covered the entire novel, but I've heard that many courses will teach selected chapters and even leave the entire second volume out!  Please don't pass this one up!  Character development is strong and the best poetry is in this volume."
580,0,"Tells you better than a history book about the mores of feudal China.Big families were a state with its prerogatives, submission, The state of women, tough inferior, did not limit their speaking out specially to their class equals. Yes, it can be a boring set of books, but what you learn about pomp and prejudice makes it worthwhile. This volume describes day to day living in family communities."
581,0,The book is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
582,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
583,0,"Any Horror aficionado who does not purchase and read ALL of Brandon Massey's edited anthologies is missing a major, MAJOR source of excellent storytelling, frightening tales, and I'm telling you, fresh horror perspectives and we all know how hard THOSE are to find! I am a Lovecraft fan, a M.R. James fan, and NOW I can PROUDLY boast that I am a Brandon Massey fan, a Tananarive Due fan, an L.R. Giles devotee to name just a FEW of the excellent horror story weavers in these anthologies. I am STILL mildly traumatized by a story in the last anthology, ""Danger Word"" by the great Tananarive Due and Uber talented Steven Barnes, I kid you not. I am a happy collector of any of Brandon's work and that collecting shall continue."
584,0,"This is the third installment of the Dark Dreams anthology series and so far, the best of the lot. Though previous entries were very good, none of them consistently delivered like this one. Oddly enough, the current book is the one with the least amount of promotion. So I thought I'd add my two cents."
585,0,I recommend Whispers In The Night on the basis of the following stories:
586,0,SCAB by Wrath James White. This story was my first introduction to White and what an introduction! Very powerful short story about where insecurity and negative self image can lead. A young man is so totally convinced he is ugly and unlovable until he perceives genuine romantic interest as ridicule and responds in the most barbaric of ways. One of the best stories in the installment.
587,0,"AND DEATH RODE WITH HIM by Anthony Beal. This story deals with hell and the inability to escape it. Not as good as Scab, but a nice story nonetheless."
588,0,"ARE YOU MY DADDY by Lexi Davis. This was another one of my favorites in the anthology. Once again, I never heard of Lexi Davis before this. But on the basis of her work here, I'll make an effort to purchase her future works. Davis somehow manages to combine humor and horror and turn it into a rollicking good time! This story had me literally laughing out loud! Its hysterical! So good, in fact, I was depressed when it was over. This was the first short story I read where I was disappointed it was a short story...I wanted it to go on for several more pages. If you need one reason to buy this book, this story is it!"
589,0,TO GET BREAD AND BUTTER by Randy Walker. Good story -- about equal to AND DEATH RODE WITH HIM.
590,0,"DREAM GIRL by Dameon Edwards -- slightly better than TO GET BREAD AND BUTTER. Actually, this would've been a much better tale if it had some sort of closure to it."
591,0,MY SISTER'S KEEPER by Chesya Burke. This was a powerful story. A sister is lost to crack addiction and her family must write her off for their own well-being. It's heartrending...remarkably potent for a short story. This is a perfect example of how to write about a depressing topic without needlessly alienating the reader. Its another favorite.
592,0,"THE WASP by Robert Fleming. With all due respect to the author, I didn't care for this tale too much. Fleming's literary skills are exceptional. But the story itself bordered on sadism. A little too twisted for me. Besides being a man, the resolution left me feeling uncomfortable..."
593,0,HELL IS FOR CHILDREN by Rickey Windell George. Same as above. Too depressing. Aren't black people down enough already???? Read Chesya Burke.
594,0,FLIGHT by Lawana James-Holland. Great tale. It seems a little out of place in a horror anthology though. It reads more like heroic fiction. This is the antidote to anyone put off by REH's prejudicial Solomon Kane stories. Love to see James-Holland turn this into a recurring character...
595,0,"MR. BONES by Christopher Chambers. Loved this story. It reminded me of the indignities minstrel performers like Bert Williams had to endure. It really touched a nerve. If this story doesn't inspire you to conduct yourself with class and dignity, there's no hope for you. Should be required reading...another favorite."
596,0,POWER AND PURPOSE by L.R. Giles. This story is too good to be ignored. Karyn has a premonition of a popular minister's assassination. She does everything in her power to keep it from coming to pass. Karyn should be a recurring character. Giles only gets better with time. I liked his story in the previous anthology and this one is far better than that one!
597,0,"GHOSTWRITER by Brandon Massey is a nice sentimental story...that adds closure to this volume. Not his best work, but it'll do..."
598,0,"So the stories I highly recommend reading are Scab, Are you my Daddy? My Sister's Keeper, Flight, Mr. Bones and Power and Purpose! The other stories are fine. But these more than compensate for the price of the book."
599,0,Some of the stories were poorly written on the plot was very basic. It was just ok.
600,0,I've read many horror stories and I must say these stories really and truly got to me! Especially being that I could relate more closely to the stories from an african american point of view! I don't know which was my favorite and I wouldn't even try to say which was my favorite they were all that good and CREEPY!
601,0,A must read for the horror genre readers! Enjoy!
602,0,"This is the 3rd in the Dark Dreams Series!  You won't be let down with this new group of short stories!  Tananarive Due's ""Summer"" will have you checking those summertime bugs that always seem to be hanging around! ""Are You My Daddy"" gives new meaning to Baby Mama Drama!  If you've enjoyed Dark Dreams I and II you won't be disappointed!"
603,0,I bought this book after a few years b/c I couldn't hold out any longer I wanted to see what the next installment offered. Man did I waste my money. The stories were not as engaging and I felt as if the tone of this book was a lot different from previous entries. I tried but couldn't engage myself with any of the stories.

605,0,"As with the two previous outings, this anthology is a guilty pleasure and privilege. Though, I'm always saddened that we still have to segregate in the 21st century to gain mainstream recognition.  I'm an avid fan of Ms. Due and Mr. Massey and have collected almost they have written."
606,0,This book i cld not put down. lost a lot of sleep lol. This is a book that keep u on the edge. Recommended it to my daughter who feel the same way
607,0,received the product really fast and very impressed.  would order again from the seller
608,0,"Though not as beautifully translated as Penguin's five volume 'Story of a Stone', this is still a good solid version of this great book.  The novel is the tale of a leftover stone tile that was created to repair a hole in the heavens.  Fallen to Earth, it is born in human form, a boy born with a piece of sacred jade in his mouth.  Of nobility, he lives on an estate and prefers to stay in the red chambers of the women of the household, learning from his sisters, cousins and aunts of life and love."

610,0,My favourite Chinese classic.
611,0,"You can get the basics from Amazon.com reviews of the 1958 Anchor paperback (although its abridged) and from reviews of some other hard-copy editions. I just want to add, here, some thoughts on the writing itself."
612,0,"All four major Chinese epics (the others being ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms,"" ""Monkey"" or sometimes translated as ""Journey to the West,"" and ""Outlaws of the Marsh"" sometimes translated as ""Water Margin"") including this one are written in ways that differ from the approaches of Western literature. In the West, we're accustomed to what one might describe as the art of fiction, or fictional technique - the considerations about which you can read in any how-to book on fiction writing. Different techniques were perfected at different times and some have gone into and out of use, but some majors, dating as far back as ancient times, include attention to choices as to what events/episodes will be presented and the manner of presentation for each. Such considerations, while not completely absent from Chinese epics, tend to be handled far less attentively often leading the works to come off as ""brain dumps"" wherein the author just spills out everything swimming through his brain with little or no attempt to creatively organize it (Three Kingdoms is extreme in this regard) and possibly even raising questions about whether these were even written as unified works or were cobbled together later from many shorter works (I speculate that suspect this might be the case with Monkey)."
613,0,"Due to such issues, Red Chamber is a very difficult read. There are many characters here, a lot, a heck of a lot. Unlike Three Kingdoms, Red Chamber does a decent job at keeping us on top of which characters are major and which are minor, but here, there are so darned many characters, and the minor ones tend to hang around for a long time and in some cases all the way through, it can be as hard to keep track as it was in Three Kingdoms and Outlaws (with its 108 protagonists). Objectively, one might make a case that it should be easier to keep track of who's who in Red Chamber, but I found it more difficult than the others. I'm not sure why, but I suspect it may have something to do with the kinds of events that are described. In Three Kingdoms and Outlaws, we're constantly dealing with life-and-death issues while in Red Chamber, we're pounded with mind-numbing trivia, such as chapter after chapter covering excruciating details of poetry competitions held among idle youth of a noble household."
614,0,"Another factor adding to the reader's difficulty is the last 40 (out of 120) chapters. There is a lot of controversy regarding authorship, how the chapters came about, etc. And frankly, it does read as if a separate work was grafted on with just so-so attention to consistency. There are some alterations of character, but for me, the biggest issue goes back to the trivia. In the first 80 chapters (and a bit in the last 40), we see mind-numbing brain-dump-type details of trivial household events. Simultaneously in the last 40 chapters, we see extremely rushed (way too rushed) treatment over some major, landmark matters (such as the final fall of some noble families and their subsequent rehabilitation). It was very off-putting and added to the difficulties I had in fully appreciating this work."
615,0,"I can see there is a truly major epic here, and again, the Amazon.com reviews on various hard-copy editions preset the themes well. But I do have to warn you that the Chinese-epic brain-dump narration technique is very much a factor in Red Chamber, making this a very difficult read."
616,0,Interesting picture of the life in a time in China.
617,0,"Amazon jumbles many ""classic"" texts and editions, but if this is the ""A Dream of Red Mansion: Complete + Unexpurgated,"" Gladys Yang gets translation credit. She was English, the first undergrad at Oxford and with her husband Yang Xianyi went to settle in his homeland in 1940."
618,0,"They worked for the Foreign Languages Press as translators, and although the subtitle says such for Dream, spot-checking the Amazon preview of this vs. the Hawkes-Minford ""Story of the Stone"" version shows that the ""Dream"" does expurgate, say ""Carnal Street"" as a phrase and that Yang cuts some phrases and slight details kept by Hawkes from my comparison as part 1 commences. I have heard that the translators for the FLP had to watch themselves under the PRC, that the pair suffered 4 years in jail during the Cultural Revolution and that their ""rehabilitation"" involved this ""Dream"" work. But they then fell into disfavor again after speaking out against the suppression by the regime of demonstrators in 1989. She died at the age of 80 ten years later. Her biography is still forbidden in the PRC."
619,0,"My comments here are to guide potential customers as it's confusing to sift through the various formats and translations. Yang's is better than the public-domain Henry Bencraft Joly found in inexpensive Kindle versions, which cut far more of the novel. HBJ died after only completing the first half, note. His Victorian style and Yang's formal register remain a bit less fluid than the Penguin. Yang's not bad, however, from a mid-20c. origin. There is an elegance in the diction which endures regardless of the choice. The es-pat pair also has their ""The Scholars"" from FLP (1957) which may be the only English-language rendering of that minor classic."
620,0,"Three stars for ""Dream"" as while the bargain cost is welcome contrasted to the Penguin, you get what you pay for. No notes, from the sample at least, tied to the text. For a novel this ""foreign"" to Westerners, this (so I've been told) somewhat more literal rendition may make this more a crib-text or handy comparison in online form to the Penguin five-volume paperback. Plus there's not even an introduction in this format."
621,0,"On a final note, I admit the cover is fantastic. It does capture the Maoist ""repackaging"" of this evocative tale of a very different Chinese era."
622,0,"Worth noting, and the main reason I'm writing this review: contrary to what it says on the cover, this is NOT volume 1 of Dream of Red Mansions, it's the complete edition of 120 chapters as translated by Gladys Young and her husbang Yang Hsieng-Yi (the same text as the Foreign Languages Press edition). You don't need to buy anything else to have the complete text--plus, at the time I'm writing this, it's a very cheap way to own the ebook."
623,0,"Dream of Red Mansions is a classic of Chinese literature, and well worth the read--this is a good translation, though due to the lack of notes it does require a working knowledge of Chinese culture to be able to follow some of the plot twists."
624,0,"This translation leaves out may nuances and details that David Hawkes created in his translation.  If you want beautiful literature and excellent translation, read The Story of the Stone as Hawkes translated it. So much description and color is lost in this transation, I got bored reading it.  Do yourself a favor and read Story of the Stone instead."
625,0,"I recently purchased this book because I've read it in the past and will need to make reference to it (though I have pretensions of scholarship, this is not a scholarly review!).  I enjoy reading everything written by Anthony Yu.  In _Re-Reading_ I appreciate his detailed analysis and his direct comment on religious elements in Honglou Meng (Dream of the red chamber).  Anthony Yu is willing to take on the broad community of scholars to make his particular points of emphasis and in Re-Reading I feel he especially allows for a closer sympathy to the characters of the novel and their engagement with their own destinies.  Some may feel the theory to be a little steep but I feel the whole discussion helps me personally to work through what I see in the novel."

629,0,"The pacing was done like how a seasoned Executive Chef presents a meal, none too ironic for a chef skilled at MIXIN’ Flava’, staking his worth in creating ‘that’ signature dish, who has led kitchens cooking for the Obamas not once, but at least twice. Guess I must now try that ‘foie gras ganache. I’m saying, this memoir is packed with flavor."
630,0,"Overall, delivering a memoir that pulls on all the senses, from the choices Marcus made selecting friends, his lessons learned acknowledging mistakes, his passion for cooking, which includes a broad professional culinary education, along with sacrifices he’s taken on... like the many people he’s mentored...near and far, none more so than his half sisters, makes Yes, Chef a phenomenal treat to experience! Absolutely redeemable. Highly recommended. Simply a Must!"
631,0,"Ordered this as a Kindle daily deal, and had to put everything on hold for 2 days while I finished it. A fascinating story of one man's journey from being a 2-year-old tubercular Ethiopian orphan to a ""celebrity chef."" Fascinating peak behind the scenes at top restaurants and what it takes to be a ""star"" chef. In some ways a brutally honest book. Samuelsson doesn't always come out the hero. He is ambitious, driven, and single-minded,sometimes to his detriment. But he also shows great insight about the journey that has brought him to where he is now, a gift that may be as rare as the kind of talent he has. I noticed that some of the more negative reviews focus on the fact that the reader likes Samuelsson less after reading the book. Fair enough, but I would argue that discovering that someone you admire has some flaws, while disappointing, doesn't mean the book is bad. The writing is good. The story-telling engaging. Those qualities make it worth the read."
632,0,"I enjoyed this book a lot.  I was hooked from the first page.  His life story is unreal being adopted from Ethiopia by a loving Swedish couple.  He enjoyed helping his Swedish grandmother in the kitchen.  His original choice of a career would have been as a soccer player and he was good but he was not tall.  He then turned to food.  I enjoyed learning how hard one has to work to become a good chef.  His Swedish parents did a good job raising him.  He had the self confidence to travel to different countries to train.  I liked his descriptions of spices and different restaurants that he either worked at or visited.  If I ever get to New York, I'd love to visit The Red Rooster.  Best wishes for continuing success Marcus!"

Meanwhile, we meet a principled human being working to strengthen an American community that has seen decline. All this, and well-written, too. I liked it a lot."
634,0,"Yes, Chef by Marcus Samuelsson"
635,0,"A remarkable story about a man who came from Ethiopia, adopted by Swedish parents, grew to love and had a passion for cooking. Who today is considered a Celebrity Chef in his own right, Marcus Samuelsson."
636,0,"It's All About the Taste, the Taste... Learning the basics of Swedish, German , and French cooking wasn't enough for this chef's palate. He wanted to explore the various cities of all the exciting flavors that each had to offer. As he made his journey he would often write in his journal what flavors would be compatible with certain dishes. Marcus wanted to create food so that the customer could enjoy his dish in that moment and not worry about the everyday world,"
637,0,Reading this novel made me hungry. Chef Samuelsson had a way in describing his many prepared dishes that I could actually visualize what it looked liked to it's  Aromas. People of all cultures can take comfort in food. Food is our communicator that brings people together. No words are expressed just the facial expressions of those enjoying their cuisine says it all.
638,0,Perhaps this memoir should have been titled I'm a Black Chef. Even though this was a well written memoir Samuelsson did focus a great deal of the book to being a black man struggling to become a chef in a white dominated field. I felt he complained about this a bit too much.
639,0,"I have read several memoirs by chefs and believe me this profession is not for the weak at heart. These people eat, breath and live their calling. Ramsey, Puck, White, Reichel and Samuelsson did not become great Chefs by being mediocre. they about killed themselves working and striving to be not just good but by becoming the best!"
640,0,Samuelsson wrote about his background being adopted by a loving Swedish couple. He had a wonderful upbringing and credits his Swedish grandmother giving him his love of food. Later in the book he goes into his Ethiopian birth country. He locates his birth father and several half siblings.
641,0,I've enjoyed watching Samuelsson on the Food Network. I saw when he won Chef Masters and watched him on Chopped as a judge. now I've read his memoir. I admire his dedication and came away again realizing being a Chef is damn hard work!!
642,0,"This book reminded me of Alberto Salazar's memoir on running. I know that sounds odd but it is just another good story on the drive and determination that some immigrants have. Makes me feel a bit lazy at times as a native born American. Marcus has faced a lot of adversity and there are some real high moments for him in his life as well as low. I have read a lot of chef bio's and this one ranks pretty high as a decent read. I love his description of food as he travels and works at many different places around the world. It has inspired me to buy some berbere spice to try on food at home. He talks A LOT about race. Being Caucasian, I knew that a person of different ethnicity might have to think about whether the treatment they receive in life is a result of their color just as easily as it is a result of their personality. But to be honest, I never realized someone could think about it this often. He touches on it probably in every single chapter of the book. Not to say whether this is good or bad, just something I noticed. I would recommend this book to any foodie who might enjoy having a little background knowledge on the people they see on TV."
643,0,"Yes, Chef tells the story of Marcus Samuelsson's life from his adoption as a young boy in Ethiopia to his success opening Red Rooster in Harlem.  Before picking up this book I wasn't a superfan of Samuelsson's, but I had heard him speak at a food conference so I knew he had a compelling life story and this book didn't disappoint."
644,0,"There are a few things that made this book wonderful.  First, it felt very well written and flowed well as a story, so kudos to Veronica Chambers for that.  It definitely held my interest from the first page to the last.  It helps that Samuelsson has an interesting and less than typical life, which for me, made the book interesting and different than other chef memoirs I have read.  I also appreciated how candid the book was.  Samuelsson takes us through some of his biggest triumphs as well as his failures and more humbling moments.  I can understand why that doesn't make him a very likable protagonist to some readers but I thought it made the book feel more real and honest and made me feel like I had a better sense of Samuelsson as a person.  Sure at times he does come across as confident in his abilities, but I also thought it was well balanced by moments of humility and vulnerability.  I also won't disagree with those reviewers who said that he talks about how hard he works a lot, but I took it less as bragging so much as a depiction that being a chef of a high stature doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice. I also can find reading about egomaniacal chefs a turnoff, but Samuelsson didn't strike me as that."
645,0,"Overall, I really, really loved this book.  I found it to be an entertaining read that also made me feel like I understood not only Samuelsson better, but also the world of elite chefs.  I think it a book that foodies will really enjoy and could also see it being enlightening to someone who wants to enter the culinary food."
646,0,"Let me start by saying that I actually bought TWO copies of YES, CHEF ! By Marcus Samuelsson. The first copy was on my Kindle but there were so many ""gems"" and tidbits I wanted to underline (I still prefer a pencil for underlining) that I also bought a hardcover copy.  Marcus Samuelsson has had a very unlikely rise to Chef Stardom.  He was born in Ethiopia but he and his sister were adopted by loving Swedish parents at the tender age of 1.  The first chapter which describes how that came to be, is probably my favorite chapter of the entire book.  It is a truly sad and moving tale. He almost didn't become a Chef as in his own words, his adopted Mother wasn't a cook.  In fact, she hated cooking.  It was seen as a chore.  However, his grandmother loved cooking and Marcus' favorite memories as a Child are the Saturdays he would spend cooking side by side with his grandmother.  This was after Soccer practice - it turns out Soccer is his first and true love. His dream was to be a professional Soccer player but was too slight/short.  In many ways, it is his failure as a Soccer player that fueled his extremely hard work ethic in the Kitchen."
647,0,"Besides winning Top Chef Masters in 2010, he is probably best known as the 3-star Chef of Aquavit in NYC in the mid 90's.  The bulk of the book eloquently describes the windy, grueling path he took to become a World famous Chef.  It was a lot less glamourous than a lot of people would think e.g. his first job involved getting up every morning at 6 AM and scrubbing the walk-in (refrigerator) from top to bottom.  I actually had the pleasure of working in the Pastry Kitchen at Mesa Grill in 1994-1995 and he is right - there is really nothing glamourous about working in a kitchen unless you are the Head Chef (who has had to work many years to get to the top).  Even though the bulk of the book talks about his various restaurant experiences, it is a very personal memoir.  The biggest shocker was that he fathered a daughter when he was 19 years old.  And although he was financially responsible for her well-being (at his Mother's insistence) he wasn't there for her emotionally or physically at all.  I have to say that learning this fact made me really dislike him.  He finally decides to meet her when she is a teenager and hopefully, they have a good relationship now.  The main reason he gives for not being a ""Father"" to her is that he didn't want to be the stereotypical African American male who fosters a child at 19.  In fact, he hides it from all of his employers and most of his friends.  The book touches a lot on the delicate topic of race.  As an Ethiopian who is raised in Sweden then working in NYC, in a field dominated by White males, I don't think he can escape that complex topic.  When he is snubbed by a fancy restaurant (apparently on appearance alone) he writes ""I made it a point not to dwell on the matter of race.  I believed in my knife skills, and my sense of taste, and my capability to listen and get things done. I was never afraid of hard work."""
648,0,"I think the best way to describe both the book and the Chef is dubbing him the ""Berbere"" of Chefs.  Berbere is a very complex spice used in Ethiopian cuisine - among its many ingredients are: chile , black pepper, salt, cardamon, ginger, etc.  Marcus' diverse experiences has made him a very complex man/Chef.  Yes, I really disliked how he treated his own daughter yet I couldn't help warming up to him when he describes how he fought to have his Ethiopian sisters back home get Schooling.  And how he would often take a huge gamble on someone that didn't have the resume to work at a 3-start restaurant.  Or cook the identical meal he served the President of the United States to the neighborhood children in his Harlem apartment.  By the end of the book, I felt very privileged to have had access to such a personal look into that life of a great Chef."
649,0,"Yes Chef delivered everything I hoped it would.  Marcus tells his story in an honest and humble tone from beginning to end.  My copy of this book is covered in little post it arrows where I marked how he prepared truffles (you add them to the sauce at the very end so as not to cook all the flavor out), and his Spanish breakfast (ripe tomatoes peeled and then crushed on toast adding a grind or two of black pepper), and how to make a lobster lasagna.  When curing duck breasts Marcus would soak then in a large pan of salted water with a plate weighing them down for 6 hours."
650,0,Mouth watering yet?
651,0,"And in between pages of mixing seasonings and different flavors is Marcus' story.  Growing up and moving out... restaurant experiences that are detailed from where he got it right, and from when he should have been fired and by grace he was not.  And then into Marcus' life as the one doing the firing and trying to find kitchen held that understood the demands of a kitchen, one employee even telling him,"
652,0,"  ""You can ask me to be on time, iron my shirt, shave or not to wear sneakers, but you can't ask them all of me... it's too much."""
653,0,  ~Page 309 Yes CHEF
654,0,"Yes Chef was interesting and a fun book to read that I will refer to again and again.  Marcus is a true story of battling against the odds, fighting prejudices and coming out on top.  His tips on food throughout the book are things I want to try, things I would have never considered, but when I read Yes CHEF, I felt inspired."
655,0,"Highly recommended to lovers of memoirs, cooking related books and success stories... I loved this book."
656,0,"I have been reading a great deal of Urban Fantasy, and I was very much up for a change of pace. This really hit the spot, as they say. I felt like the characters were cohesive, complex and shown to the reader from enough angles to make them feel alive and real. While they all spoke in the flowery speech considered polite, it was easy to tell their personalities from their particular speech habits. I am often cut-throat in my reviews about dialogue so it's refreshing to be able to compliment, not critique it in a review."
657,0,"The best thing about this book was not the plot -- because this is a fairly old work the plot has many of the tropes we readers come to expect from this sort of work. They may seem cliched now because so many newer works have aped them. However, the descriptions are astounding -- detailed and precise yet not overlong or exhausting. It always maintains the perfect level to engross and trap the reader but not bore them. The 'movie' in my head was awash with wonderful detail, lush backgrounds and perfect costumes. I really haven't read description this good in a very long time."
658,0,"However, the one thing I didn't care for was the three or four incidents of anachronism stew. Xifeng had a wrist watch centuries before they came into fashion, Baochai had a few too many modernisms in her speech and  the Chinese manners of gift-giving were ignored, possibly to make the work more appropriate for a western audience. If these had not stuck out of the narratives like sudden blotches of bright paint on a somber renaissance portrait, this would have been five stars. UPDATE -- the author has taken the time to address this paragraph in the comments. Please read her replies as they explain a great deal."
659,0,"This is a translation....so there is usually some loss of understanding.  The book is massively long and the names of the characters are very confusing.  In the front of the book they give a geneology map...you've got to be kidding...no way to keep track....just keep on reading.  It does give a great description of the class system, the mores, and the discrimination that was present. However...I found it to be  an exhausting book to read  and I lost interest in the characters"
660,0,One of the best books I've read about China during that time frame. I was able to relate to the different characters even though they were totally out of my frame of reference. I had sympathy for the various chactacters and the author

662,0,"Historical novel I am learning much about the period, the place, the history, and how it affected those people that lived through it. I will not soon forget this wonderful novel. I am so glad that this author re-wrote this historical novel and made it simpler for the present readers. it must have been a difficult undertaking and I can see from Pauline Chen's impressive degrees that she truly was in a position to write such an intelligent book. Please write more!!!"
663,0,I consider this story a fan fiction based on the original rather than a abridged version of the original considering the number of characters the author either kills off at the beginning or allowed to live till the end.
664,0,The bad: It is written in present tense. Why did the author do this? It makes reading it more awkward. Four stars if it had not been written in present tense. Seems common for debut authors for some reason.
665,0,"The good: It's an interesting, easy to read version of a very long plodding confusing classic. Her version of the ending is mostly believable (except the epilogue!) and the characters are well drawn if perhaps seemingly a bit different from the original."
666,0,"Read this and then read the five volume version, you'll appreciated both more."
667,0,I've been reading various versions and translations of  A Dream of Red Chambers since the mid 70's and approached this book with some trepidation. Well I enjoyed it so much I bought the audio book (which brought came with the extra bonus of learning the correct pronounciation of charactar's names) and have listened several times over which then leads to a re-reading of the original:-)
668,0,BTW a set of unabridged audio books of ADoRC would be worth the expense...
669,0,There were too many characters with names that I couldn't even pretend to sound out. The book was too long then just ended. I did not enjoy this book
670,0,"suggest you read this book of you have an interest in China, it's customs and politics. The love stories may make this book appeal more to women."
671,0,"I think this novel may have been received better had Chen creditted the Red Chamber rather than fashion this book as a retelling. The closed world of a family in standing within the classical world of its Emporors, feels like a peeping with Daiyu into a secret world.  I am intrigued with the linked lives of the women of this world and how they live out their lives often within a few rooms. Despite its failure to stand alone as ""The"" Red Chamber, Chen has brought us to a different way of seeing the world"
672,0,"I have never read Dream of the Red Chamber but decided to pick up this novel as a condensed version of the aforementioned.  Pauline Chen's The Red Chamber is a captivating read from the get-go, especially in that it provides the right balance of historical context while not detracting from the depths of the main characters.  Some may be unhappy at the changes that have been made in this novel, but if it's taken as a separated, individual novel rather than a reworking of the classic, it will prove to be an enjoyable read.  I was caught up in the novel to the point that I was in tears by the end."
673,0,"Descriptive, thought provoking, emotional. Very easy to read and I literally could not put the book down. The names of the characters took a little getting used to, but I soon got familiar with them. Highly recommend."
674,0,"""The notebook"" was ordered for my wife after she saw the movie. She says that she rates it five stars."
675,0,"This book had a magnificent whirl of fun twisted into it, while it still kept the seriousness of jing wang."
676,0,"This is a Chinese classic, which is nicely translated to English. It's an interesting story and provides a glimpse into aristocratic culture in 18th century China."
677,0,"It's a little hard to read, with a staggering number of characters who are referred to by both their names and their informal familiar titles. I gave up trying to keep track of all the characters and decided to power through the book focusing on the main plot and the central characters. For the more patient reader, the book is nicely footnoted, explaining the meaning of the names and the familiar titles, so it is possible to follow the details if you have the patience."
678,0,"Abridged from a multi-volume mid-18-Century novel, this lively retelling captures the essence and the details of life and love in a rich Chinese household. Multiple intrigues and myriad characters mix, some characters disappear, some plots remain unresolved. But there is no complete version, so this greatly shortened rendition is quite satisfactory."
679,0,This is the greatest novel ever published in the Chinese language. A true classic. Perhaps at the same level as Shakespeare. This novel is so highly regarded that entire schools of thought and research have arisen around it.
680,0,In China this is considered a literary classic. I read it because I do business with China and I was told it might make understand their culture better. It really didn't it might of lost something in translation but a good story.
681,0,"Dream of the Red Chamber, written in the 18th century in China, is a book for people who have a particular interest in Chinese culture.  For those of thus who do, we are grateful to have it available.  But for a person just looking for a diverting read, not so much."
682,0,"An interesting read, makes me wish I understood a bit more of the Chinese writing tradition. Would recommend to someone who is interested in great world literature."
683,0,"Chinese version, sorta, of Peyton Place.  An amusing and educational (chinese culture) read.  Discovered this book on a list of texts required for a Chinese literature class."
684,0,"If you don't read another Chinese novel, this one will complete your experience.  It is the quintissential story of family life in China."
685,0,"I needed this book for my east asian civilization class and I was already dreading reading a required book. This book is actually really well written. It deals with chinese legends and myths mix in with fiction. The names in the story can be confusing (you will mix them up) for a Western reader like myself but the book reminds you every so often who everyone is. Please pick up this book, you won't be disappointed."
686,0,a great descriptive story
687,0,"Don't buy this edition unless Dover fixes the print quality. Currently the printing of the edition is visibly, albeit subtly pixelated, like they printed with the wrong resolution. I exchanged with Amazon and the second copy was identically pixelated. I will be calling Dover about this."
688,0,This book came in amazing condition! I was very pleased.
689,0,This book is great. Nothing is pixelated. The other buyer must have gotten a defective copy.
690,0,"One of most amazing classic stories I have ever read. A most worthy addition to anyone's library, this story grabs the reader immediately and draws them into the deeply involved and enmeshed lives of a large extended family, revealing both the outer and inner lives of family members in sinuous weaving of interlocked story lines. I just loved this almost magical tale and found myself deliberately slowing down to stay in the story longer. It went a long way to help me to understand the workings if a Chinese multi-generational family for whom devotion to the family good overrides the desires of the individual."
691,0,"The other reviewer wasn't kidding, there really are no spaces for much of the book. No idea how to return a kindle book and I'd advise others to not waste $10 on this!"
692,0,"The printing had no spaces between words, non readable."
693,0,This is one of the very most beautiful works of literature you will find.  The breadth and historical insights that are written about offer important insights and details of Chinese society and family life.  Be ready to seek out time so that you can continue your journey if discovery.

Like me, he is a book collector, and has been wanting the first volume of this title, ""A Dream of Red Mansions"" for some time now (he already has Volumes 2 and 3). I purchased this book through a third party vendor here on Amazon and the book arrived intact and in excellent, almost new condition. It is a hardcover, printed in China, and is the first edition. The book contains some beautiful color illustrations depicting important scenes from the book. A classic of Chinese literature, this is a story that will appeal to readers keen to explore the diversity in world literature."
714,0,"This is one of the most interesting and profound novels I have read, a masterpiece of Chinese literature and a world class contribution. I genuinely enjoyed this translation of this 250-year old novel. The text flowed well and was clear and understandable.  The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature. The descriptions and characterization are so realistic you feel as if you have known those people and places for years. I would say this is a must-read!"
715,0,"I am studying Chinese and but my reading is not good enough to be able to read the original of this famous classic novel.  What I really liked about this edition was having Chinese and English face to face, which helps me practice reading my Chinese.  The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.  The 6 volumes are thick and heavy, and we are treated to a full page illustration in the style of Chinese painting every other chapter.  That's about 60 paintings."
716,0,"The reason I give it a star less is the prevalence of typos.  You're likely to encounter one every page or every few pages.  Most were obvious and easy to correct, but it was rather annoying.  A little more quality control in the typesetting would have helped."

723,0,"Romanization schemes for Chinese are notoriously imperfect, if for no other reasons than that 4 tones -- 5 if you count a null tone sometimes used -- are not immediately obvious to those who do not have a speaking knowledge of any of the Chinese dialects."
724,0,"Perhaps I am prejudiced, having learned Chinese primarily using texts that happened to (mostly) rely on the Pinyin system.  However, it seems to me that Pinyin has the distinct merit of adhering most closely to the principles of most of the primary European languages (especially Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages) where vowel sounds are far more regular and predictable than they are in English, particularly."
725,0,"I can't comment (yet) on this particular translation, though I am working through several other bilingual editions that are part of the same Foreign Language Press publication project, and can give a few early impressions based on what I've read so far."
726,0,"These translations are commendable in that they seek to provide a full translation of the works in question, thereby attempting to avoid some of the cultural ""hyperbole"" that has been attached to some of these works by translators approaching the texts from outside the context of Chinese culture.  As a native-born speaker of English, I did not begin studying Chinese until my late teens and will never have the complete understanding of the culture to argue persuasively over the finer points of these translations."
727,0,"However, on the intuitive side, I do not a certain defensiveness at times and an effort to provide translations that are either culturally acceptable to present-day political realities in the Chinese mainland regions, or that may simply be dodging some of the tougher editorial calls to be made."
728,0,"It is very clear, especially in some of the introductory matter that accompanies many texts in this series, that the final English version was approved by someone not a native speaker of idiomatic English.  In most cases, the evidence appears in simple errors of literal translation of phrases that make perfect idiomatic sense in Chinese, but, rendered with too much literal faithfulness, are puzzling to say the least when they are rendered in English."
729,0,"I would agree with others who've commented that these texts are probably best for someone whose knowledge of Chinese is limited and is looking for an English ""crib sheet"" for entering into the Chinese originals (or in some cases, modern Chinese renditions of Classical Chinese texts, as in FLP's 2 volume translation of the works of Zhuangzi).  Note, however, that the FLP translation of Zhuangzi is (unless I'm mistaken) the most complete translation presently available in English, and this is true of many other texts in the FLP's publishing project)."
730,0,"As a student of Chinese language, I really don't care much what romanization method is used.  They are all far from ideal.  What I care about is that someone is making these texts available in English, even if the translations are not always the most poetic -- where poetry is called for."
731,0,"I love this story, I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back. The Original book is over 5000 pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the 1835 original unfinished work. Le's put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is 28 episodes each an hour and a half long"
732,0,"I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the ""Redists"", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!"
733,0,Not a good translation and hard to follow. I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.
734,0,This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline.  It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him.  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful.  I think the story takes place in the 17th century.  I don't think it can be read in a hurry.  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book.
735,0,Allow a year or so to enjoy it.  I return to it again and again.
736,0,"Although the translation is atrocious, and the book is poorly redacted, it may be the most concise version ever made of this fantastic book, which should get a lot more credit in the West. Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English. Personally, some simple mistakes, repeated along the 1000 pages of the Romance, became very grating, like ""the Cao Cao's army""."
737,0,"I can still recommend it for skilled readers, because it's the only version for Kindle at an affordable price, and it's quicker to read than other translations."
738,0,"It may be ponderous to read, and possibly difficult to keep track of everyone, but it was an enjoyable read for me."
739,0,After watching Red Cliff I had the desire to read more of the before and after. This book filled that desire.
740,0,"If one want's to learn a bit more about individuals, or discern fact from fiction, the link on the kindle that takes you to Wikipedia is a useful tool."
741,0,"This book is very long and can be hard to get through due to the overwhelming amount of characters and events going on.  As an American, there is a culture barrier for me there as well.  However I am thankful I persevered through the story.  I've always been a big Dynasty Warriors fan, and Redcliff is one of my favorite movies. It was great to get a more complete picture of the events of the Three Kingdoms, and all the little details and interactions.  A great read if you can make it through!"
742,0,"I was introduced to the world of Romance of the Three Kingdoms thanks to the Dynasty Warriors game, and decided I wanted to read to original work that the games were based on. This is actually the second copy of the story that I've bought; the first had a drastically different translation style -- Liu Bei was Liu Pei, Guan Yu was Kuan Yu, etc -- and it was off-putting enough that I found it difficult to follow."
743,0,"For those who are here because of the same reason I was, you'll be pleased to know that this printing shares the vast majority of the translations with the games we know and love. Sun Ce is Sun Ce, not Sun T'se!"
744,0,"One of the problems with ordering a book on Kindle is that you don't know its full length in pages. ""The romance of three Kingdoms must be a rather thick volume and it is more a historical chronicle than a romance. For a non-Chinese the profusion of names and places make it confusing ( a map and a register of persons would have helped ). So , although it is ineresting ,it is also tiring"
745,0,R.Simon
746,0,"Superb, still one of the best piece of literatures. I have read it many times in other language. It is interesting to read it in English and see some variations in the interpretation of the translator. There are problems due to name pronunciations."
747,0,"I quite like books that are long even if they are very dry, like economics books.  But this one was a bit too not good to read.  It reads like a very simple story but too many characters are thrown at you for no more than a line or two and you end up lost trying to unnecessarily remember them all."
748,0,"Its a good story, but not very readable."
749,0,I love the stories. I first learned about the three kingdoms playing DYNASTY WARRIORS and reading the book brought real depth and insight into the history. A great read if you can overlook some typos and bad translations.
750,0,"The characters names get to be to much, since they are Chinese name they get to be hard to remember, but it is a great read.  The action moves right alone so name are not to much of problem."
751,0,The Romance of Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong is an exceptional book. I recommend it to all from my heart.
752,0,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize."
753,0,"I slogged through, and found the stories engaging, the descriptions of the culture fascinating, and the plotlines very different from western stories. The time invested in completing the series was a joy. Thankfully, a glossary of individual names, relationships, and even the family trees for the families most involved appears in each volume. I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book."
754,0,"It's usually difficult to find all five volumes, so I thank Amazon for pulling the Penguin versions together."
755,0,"Nothing good lasts forever, whether we are talking about the Garden or this novel itself… Volumes 4 and 5 are thought to be written by Gao E a generation after Cao Xueqin’s untimely death.  There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s."
756,0,"Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days."
757,0,"When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point."
758,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
759,0,Contains the Dream of the Red Chamber
760,0,"This is the point where the author had left off and his friends subsequently pieced together his notes and drafts.  The story becomes quickly incredibly depressing, all presaged in the preceding volumes but still.  it is realistically done and vivid but the story, and its characters, lose a lot of their charm.  They pay their debt of tears, with interest."
761,0,The DVD is exactly as advertised & arrived promptly. Thank you.
762,0,Good quality and fast shipping
763,0,"I am a big fan of The Story of the Stone original version (in Chinese), and I knew how terrible this English version is. Some of the sentences are very rude and unreasonable according to Chinese manners, and the names.... Nah"
764,0,I should like to return this book because it is smaller by 1/2 inch in perimeter than the other 4 volumes of the same book I acquired through Amazon.  I'd like the volumes to match in size.
765,0,  The book took so long in arriving that I had read the book borrowed from a college library by the time I received it.
766,0,  The book is also rather yellowish.
767,0,From Emily D. (pen name)
768,0,"Don't buy this edition unless Dover fixes the print quality. Currently the printing of the edition is visibly, albeit subtly pixelated, like they printed with the wrong resolution. I exchanged with Amazon and the second copy was identically pixelated. I will be calling Dover about this."
769,0,This book came in amazing condition! I was very pleased.
770,0,This book is great. Nothing is pixelated. The other buyer must have gotten a defective copy.
771,0,"Wow! Todd Keisling does not disappoint. Ever since I heard this book was coming out, I’ve been anticipating a killer story and you know what, Todd delivered! Rock n Roll, Heavy Metal… what the Baptists have long called the Devil’s music. The Yellow Kings are on their way! The Final Reconciliation is the story of a band and what was to be their rise to fame."
772,0,"It’s been 30 years since that fateful night and as the only survivor, Aidan Cross the once lead guitarist of The Yellow Kings is ready to share his story with interviewer, Miles Hargrove. Entwined in the Carcosa Mythos our narrator, Aidan takes us down a dark path leading up to the tragic night that became the band’s final concert."
773,0,"Like a hundred other bands out there, The Yellow Kings were struggling to make a name for themselves, playing local gigs and hoping for that one big break. With Reggie Allen as their manager, they were beginning to get the exposure they craved, things were looking up and then Carmilla entered their lives."
774,0,"Carmilla, the gypsy, as Aidan liked to call her was the beginning of their end. Just another groupie wanting to get laid by the band they thought. But, Carmilla had another agenda, digging her claws into Johnny Leifthauser, the lead vocalist, Carmilla was along for the ride and oh what ride it was. Even Aidan’s niggling doubts weren’t enough to see her as she truly was until it was too late to turn back. By then, their fate had been sealed."
775,0,"Laid out like tracks of an album, the chapters take us through a journey with a heavy metal influence, all the way to the bitter twisted finale. The King in Yellow by Robert W Chambers has been influential in many stories throughout the decades since it was first published in 1895. Todd has done well in keeping the mythos alive with The Final Reconciliation. This is one story you do not want to miss!"
776,0,"This is my first read from Keisling.  It definitely won’t be my last.  He writes well and easy and doesn’t convolute his work with prose he thinks may impress, much like Koontz.  The topic within the pages culls from ideas born in the late 1800s by Robert W. Chambers.  Ashamedly, I was unfamiliar with Chambers’ King in Yellow mythos until Keisling breathed his own life into it with The Final Reconciliation--a modernized, rock & roll take on a dangerous and haunting idea.  The book reeks of Lovecraftian doom, which makes sense considering Lovecraft reeked of Chambers’ work, in particular with The King in Yellow."
777,0,"The listing’s own summary pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the book so I won’t rehash that here.  I will, however, tell you that fans of all things heavy metal, Lovecraft, and horror will feel very at home within these pages."
778,0,"While some may see the end coming from only one third of the way through, it doesn’t matter because of the way the book is built.  It presents itself in a way that teases you here and there about the ending, and though you may have come up with your own conclusion, you’re still enjoying the ride.  By the time the end starts to unfold and show its ugly face all knobs are turned to eleven and you’re in it for the long haul."
779,0,"The Final Reconciliation scratches a multitude of itches, some of which you may not know you had.  Oddly enough, the book made me miss my days of writing and recording with my bands and gave me a newfound appreciation for Paul, George, and Ringo."
780,0,"Metal band the Yellow Kings are on their first tour when they meet Camilla Bierce, the woman who will be their downfall..."
781,0,"I was tangentially aware of The King in Yellow for years after playing Call of Cthulhu: Horror Roleplaying and my interest was further piqued by True Detective. When I read the synopsis for this, I was all in."
782,0,"Told by the lone survivor of the band thirty years in the future, The Final Reconciliation is the tale of the disintegration of a band as they record an album, both personally and mentally as the walls of reality thin and fray. I knew they were screwed  when Camilla called Los Angeles Carcosa but the depth of the penetration was still pretty surprising."
783,0,"As the dreams and visions of red-robed faceless things in an alien golden city become more and more intense, things go so far off track the rails are no longer visible."
784,0,"The writing feels more like noir than horror, not a bad thing in my book. There's just enough foreshadowing in the narration to make you dread the ending that's barreling toward you. I had an idea about what Camilla's goal was fairly quickly but the ending was still a punch in the sternum."
785,0,"I've read other mythos stories involving musicians, Bleeding Shadows and Crawlin' Chaos Blues springing to mind, but The Final Reconciliation is the best so far. Five out of five Yellow Signs."
786,0,"One of the finest horror novels I've ever read. I don't know the Yellow King mythology, and epic prog metal is not really a musical genre I listen to, but I know good writing and better storytelling, and this is it. The characters are fantastic, and watching the whole thing begin to fray and reveal the horror beneath comes with as much inevitability for the characters as for readers. Minor dings for too frequent use of stylistic tics like ""I'll get to that"" or ""We'll get there,"" as well as the continued in-story-text reminder that its framework is an interview conducted by a Mr Hargrave (or Hargrove -- I've already forgotten), but in the end it successful enough in its effect that I'm willing to forgive."
787,0,"I've been on a bit of a novella kick the past six months. I've consumed titles by authors such as Laird Barron and Stephen Graham Jones, and for the most part loved every single one of them. So I was delighted to see author Todd Keisling continue this trend of excellence with The Final Reconciliation, a creepy and enthralling take on Chambers' Yellow King mythos."
788,0,"Told in an interview narrative, The Final Reconciliation tells the story of the Yellow Kings, a progressive metal band whose members, along with a couple of hundred other people, were horrifically killed a private performance of their first and only album. The lone survivor, band member and guitarist Aidan Cross, recounts in this interview the terrifying events that led up to that fateful night."
789,0,"I loved this novella. I loved it so much that I actually went back and read it all over again after finishing. The Final Reconciliation is a wonderful example of a story that builds slowly yet surely and culminates in an ending that will blow your skill sideways. The pacing is superb, and Keisling slowly draws you in deeper and deeper until you realise that it's too late to escape. The characterisation is on point, with the depictions of band members and the dynamics of the music industry authentic and fascinating. I genuinely felt like I was watching a biopic of the Yellow Kings as I read, and that they were a real band whose demise was a great mystery wrapped up with conspiracy theories (like the death of Tupac, or Elvis).  The inclusion of Camilla, a gypsy and groupie who drives wedges between the band members (like a modern day Yoko Ono or Courtney Love) was also brilliant, and I was terrified watching her manipulate the band members into performing a concert that would open a celestial gate and allow her entry into Carcosa."
790,0,"Speaking of Carcosa, I adored how Keisling weaved Hastur and the Yellow King mythos into this story. A creation of author Robert W. Chambers, the Yellow King has seen a resurgence in recents years (True Detective touched on a lot of this mythos in its first season) after living in the dark shadow of Lovecraft's Cthulhu for so long. And thank the gods it has, because Hastur is arguably more terrifying and confronting than Cthulhu. The imagery and horror that Keisling throws down before you in this novella will blow you away. There's plenty of sex, buckets of blood, and loads of unearthly tunes that transcend reality and take you to another place. Carcosa itself is terrifying, and Hastur and his minions will stay at the forefront of your mind long after finishing this story. The final performance of the Yellow Kings, where they unleash all of this hell, is both stunning and jaw dropping. In fact, Keisling does an amazing job conveying the idea that music transforms you and takes you on journeys both physical and spiritual. In the case of the Yellow Kings, this isn't always a good thing."
791,0,"The Final Reconciliation is a brilliant tale told with a wonderful voice. Keisling has nailed it, and I personally can't wait to read more from him. If you like music (especially metal or rock) and mythos fiction, then you'll love this story."
792,0,4.5 stars out of 5.
793,0,"Are you the sort of person who always has a song in their head?  Perhaps when you hear a few bars of an old song on the radio you are transported to a very specific time in your past.  Maybe you mark milestones in your life with the visual images of specific albums put out by your favourite groups.  I imagine Todd Keisling as that kind of person, too."
794,0,"In his book The Final Reconciliation, he presents a music documentary about a ""where is he now"" guitarist who is the only surviving member of a band that met a mysterious and tragic end.  As the scarred and grizzled guitarist tells his story we are transported to a time that embraced ear-ripping tunes, poetically cryptic lyrics, and the beloved concept album."
795,0,Reading it I was reminded of the work of Russian artist Anatole Krasnyansky with his surreal masked characters.  Except that his characters reflect joy.  Todd Keisling's characters reflect something much darker.
796,0,I recommend this book.
797,0,"The story as told by the protagonist, Aidan, has you wondering why he wasn't the lyricist. Excellent background, and of course the fore shadowing is in the title."
798,0,"Little by little, we are led to The Final Reconciliation, which gives the reader the urge to either scream or read more rapidly. As beloved was sleeping soundly next to me (how can he DO that when I am holding my breath to the point of taking deep gulping breaths when I could no longer hold it) I chose more rapidly, greedily sucking in the story until The Final Reconciliation."
799,0,"Excellent read. Completely pulls you in from the beginning. Absolutely no dead spots, complete drawing to the inescapable conclusion, which was absolutely not what I expected. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
800,0,Another spectacular read by Crystal Lake Publishing!
801,0,"First let me say that while I have heard the  name Robert W. Chambers, I have never read anything by him, nor was I at all familiar with ""The King in Yellow"" mythos."
802,0,"That having been said, Keisling has done a phenomenal job making sure none of that matters. Also, you do not have to be a fan of heavy metal to enjoy this story, but it definitely helps! ;-)"
803,0,"Told in an interview format, (with Tracks instead of Chapters) Keisling's visceral narrative is top-notch. He keeps you hanging with every word, and while you are riding the crescendo, you are simultaneously awaiting/dreading the build-up to the catylismic ending (and what an ending it is!)"
804,0,Highly recommended!
805,0,"Keisling always puts out a great story. But The Final Reconciliation goes above and beyond all else. I felt as if I were personally on the same cross country tour as the Yellow Kings, learning the ropes, fighting the fight, making the music that would ultimately lead us to producing an album like no other. An album that would change us and the world forever. If I didn't know Todd, I'd swear he had to be Aidan himself, the story was so vivid, so personal. As an author, he has truly taken off his mask at last."
806,0,I began reading this novella shortly after it was released at midnight and couldn’t put my phone down until I had finished two hours later. I was absorbed by the prose in the same way that the characters are absorbed by the progressive rock of the Yellow Kings. My retinas are still burning from staring at the screen for so long. The Final Reconciliation is one helluva story and what a pleasure it is to read. I don’t think anyone has done something so original with the King in Yellow mythos as Keisling has done with his novella. Keisling’s never been better and I can’t wait to read whatever strange and terrifying tale he crafts next!
807,0,"You don't need me to review or opine on Robert Frost's poetry. But, let's talk about editions, Amazon's careless lumping of various books, descriptions and reviews on the same site, and what is actually in this particular book."
808,0,"This review is being posted on the site for ""The Road Not Taken and Other Poems [Illustrated]"", which was published in 2012 by Seedbox Classics. It has a photo on the cover of a snowy track through a birch forest. It is a Kindle book. I downloaded it in 2013 as a Kindle freebie, but as of the time of the posting of this review it is available for $.99."
809,0,"This site has an ""Editorial Review"" which is a table of poems from something called ""Poem Finder"". This is not a complete or correct table. Except for ""The Vanishing Red"", ""Snow"", ""The Road Not Taken"", ""Birches"" and maybe a few others the listed poems are not in the Seedbox Classics edition listed here.  Use the ""Look Inside"" feature to see the correct table of contents. You'll see that this version does include ""Mending Wall"", ""After Apple-picking"", and perhaps other poems that you want. (Parenthetically, (note the actual parentheses), I prefer the actual content of the book to the content listed by Poem Finder, but you might not.)"
810,0,"This book read well on my Kindle Touch. It was for the most part properly formatted and presented. Such typographic oddities as presented themselves did not effect readability. The ""illustrations"" are just a few thumbnail photos at the end. There is an active Table of Contents and an active Index, which are both bonuses."
811,0,"So, this is a fine selection, it works well as a Kindle book, it offers great value, and it was a happy purchase. Just be careful about what it is you're buying in order to avoid disappointment."
812,0,"I am so enjoying Robert Frost's book ""The Road Not Taken and Other Poems.  I am finding comfort in this reading.  When in school, I did not appreciate any type of poem.  Now as a Senior Citizen, I take a different view.  I suggest this to all.  Thank you."
813,0,"I have loved all kinds of poetry most of my life, with the exception of modern free verse poetry forms.  This Dover Thrift Edtion has a number poems, both rhymed lyrics and blank-verse dialogues by Robert Frost, an American writer (1874-1963).  Even though I am not a great fan of Robert Frost and do not like some of his long blank-verse dialogue poems; nevertheless, I do like many of his poems."
814,0,"One of his most famous poems, ""The Road Not Taken"" is the title and first poem in this collection.  The 56 page volume includes the following poetry collections of Robert Frost:  The Road Not Taken, Christmas Trees, An Old Man's Winter Night, A Patch of Old Snow, In the Home Stretch, The telephone, Meeting and Passing, Hyla Brook, The Oven bird, Bond and Free, Birches, Pea Brush, Putting in the Seed, A time to Talk, The Cow in Apple time, An Encounter, Range-Finding, The Hill Wife: (The Loneliness-Her word, House Fear, The Smile-Her Word, The Oft-Repeated Dream, The Impulse), The Bonfire, A girl's Garden, The Exposed Nest, Out, Out-, Brown's Descent or The Willy-Nilly Slide, the Gum-Gatherer, The Line-Gang, The Vanishing Red, Snow, and The sound of Trees."

827,0,"Bought for a young child who is just beginning to study poetry, the length of the book is perfect to get a quick glimpse of Frost's work. I do wish it included Mending Wall and Stopping by the Woods, but for the price it's a great little survey of a beloved American poet."
828,0,"As a mere admirer of poetry for the past two-and-a-half years, I have come to learn about the legends. One such being that if Robert Frost. I also grew up with Frost during both elementary and junior high schools. Granted I wasn't much interested in poetry at that time, time at least allows one to mature, and rightfully so, because I believe in order to understand poetry in its fullest and purest, you have to be mature enough to understand it. Excellent book."
829,0,"You don't need me to review or opine on Robert Frost's poetry. But, let's talk about editions, Amazon's careless lumping of various books, descriptions and reviews on the same site, and what is actually in this particular book."
830,0,"This review is being posted on the site for ""The Road Not Taken and Other Poems [Illustrated]"", which was published in 2012 by Seedbox Classics. It has a photo on the cover of a snowy track through a birch forest. It is a Kindle book. I downloaded it in 2013 as a Kindle freebie, but as of the time of the posting of this review it is available for $.99."
831,0,"This site has an ""Editorial Review"" which is a table of poems from something called ""Poem Finder"". This is not a complete or correct table. Except for ""The Vanishing Red"", ""Snow"", ""The Road Not Taken"", ""Birches"" and maybe a few others the listed poems are not in the Seedbox Classics edition listed here.  Use the ""Look Inside"" feature to see the correct table of contents. You'll see that this version does include ""Mending Wall"", ""After Apple-picking"", and perhaps other poems that you want. (Parenthetically, (note the actual parentheses), I prefer the actual content of the book to the content listed by Poem Finder, but you might not.)"
832,0,"This book read well on my Kindle Touch. It was for the most part properly formatted and presented. Such typographic oddities as presented themselves did not effect readability. The ""illustrations"" are just a few thumbnail photos at the end. There is an active Table of Contents and an active Index, which are both bonuses."
833,0,"So, this is a fine selection, it works well as a Kindle book, it offers great value, and it was a happy purchase. Just be careful about what it is you're buying in order to avoid disappointment."
834,0,"I am so enjoying Robert Frost's book ""The Road Not Taken and Other Poems.  I am finding comfort in this reading.  When in school, I did not appreciate any type of poem.  Now as a Senior Citizen, I take a different view.  I suggest this to all.  Thank you."
835,0,"I have loved all kinds of poetry most of my life, with the exception of modern free verse poetry forms.  This Dover Thrift Edtion has a number poems, both rhymed lyrics and blank-verse dialogues by Robert Frost, an American writer (1874-1963).  Even though I am not a great fan of Robert Frost and do not like some of his long blank-verse dialogue poems; nevertheless, I do like many of his poems."
836,0,"One of his most famous poems, ""The Road Not Taken"" is the title and first poem in this collection.  The 56 page volume includes the following poetry collections of Robert Frost:  The Road Not Taken, Christmas Trees, An Old Man's Winter Night, A Patch of Old Snow, In the Home Stretch, The telephone, Meeting and Passing, Hyla Brook, The Oven bird, Bond and Free, Birches, Pea Brush, Putting in the Seed, A time to Talk, The Cow in Apple time, An Encounter, Range-Finding, The Hill Wife: (The Loneliness-Her word, House Fear, The Smile-Her Word, The Oft-Repeated Dream, The Impulse), The Bonfire, A girl's Garden, The Exposed Nest, Out, Out-, Brown's Descent or The Willy-Nilly Slide, the Gum-Gatherer, The Line-Gang, The Vanishing Red, Snow, and The sound of Trees."
837,0,"In conclusion, if you are a fan of the poetry of Robert Frost, you will enjoy this collection."

840,0,They are works from Robert Frost
841,0,It is a good book.
842,0,"Frost's poems have stanzas and line indentions, form and techniques he used for meaning and effect. This Kindle version, I returned because it did have them. All the poem lines are aligned to the left and there are no stanzas, no spaces to indicate stanzas."
843,0,One of my favorite poets of all time. I can't believe I got this for less than $3 as it has some of his best work in this book. One of the greatest of our time and a must read for any poetry or nature love!
844,0,Very small book.  Nice to share with someone.
845,0,Deep and thoughtful poems on everything from old memories to the human condition.
846,0,"Some of the poems are reminiscent of having a conversation, remembering wanting to say something and yet never saying anything only to remember you wanted to say it earlier."

Excellent book."
851,0,It is one of the most impressive literary artworks I have ever been through. The life of one of the most prominent families during the Qing Dinasty is depicted with such a remarkable finesse and delicacy as to make the reader aware of the refinement of Chinese culture. Specially recommended for those who would like to be introduced to Chinese history by the hand of one of the finest writers of all times.
852,0,"OMG the translation for this book was awful!!  I am sorry, but I would not dream of giving this book a positive review."
853,0,Not my style!
854,0,"Of course, this is a superior novel that's translated very well, indeed. However, this edition has been severely edited to the size of a novelette, which rather defeats the purpose of this long and detailed work. In fact, reducing the size of the work is pointless, even as an introduction."
855,0,Read the first volume of this work to give you a real feeling for the book's complexity.
856,0,"This addition is just a repackaging of the freely available 19th century public domain translation, which translation, by the way, is not even complete.  Don't waste your money."
857,0,This is the worst of the several English translations of this book (Story of the Stone and A Dream of Red Mansions are much better). This version is also free from gutenberg. Why is amazon charging for it?
858,0,did not read book yet but I know I will love it
859,0,"The pacing was done like how a seasoned Executive Chef presents a meal, none too ironic for a chef skilled at MIXIN’ Flava’, staking his worth in creating ‘that’ signature dish, who has led kitchens cooking for the Obamas not once, but at least twice. Guess I must now try that ‘foie gras ganache. I’m saying, this memoir is packed with flavor."
860,0,"Overall, delivering a memoir that pulls on all the senses, from the choices Marcus made selecting friends, his lessons learned acknowledging mistakes, his passion for cooking, which includes a broad professional culinary education, along with sacrifices he’s taken on... like the many people he’s mentored...near and far, none more so than his half sisters, makes Yes, Chef a phenomenal treat to experience! Absolutely redeemable. Highly recommended. Simply a Must!"
861,0,"Ordered this as a Kindle daily deal, and had to put everything on hold for 2 days while I finished it. A fascinating story of one man's journey from being a 2-year-old tubercular Ethiopian orphan to a ""celebrity chef."" Fascinating peak behind the scenes at top restaurants and what it takes to be a ""star"" chef. In some ways a brutally honest book. Samuelsson doesn't always come out the hero. He is ambitious, driven, and single-minded,sometimes to his detriment. But he also shows great insight about the journey that has brought him to where he is now, a gift that may be as rare as the kind of talent he has. I noticed that some of the more negative reviews focus on the fact that the reader likes Samuelsson less after reading the book. Fair enough, but I would argue that discovering that someone you admire has some flaws, while disappointing, doesn't mean the book is bad. The writing is good. The story-telling engaging. Those qualities make it worth the read."
862,0,"I enjoyed this book a lot.  I was hooked from the first page.  His life story is unreal being adopted from Ethiopia by a loving Swedish couple.  He enjoyed helping his Swedish grandmother in the kitchen.  His original choice of a career would have been as a soccer player and he was good but he was not tall.  He then turned to food.  I enjoyed learning how hard one has to work to become a good chef.  His Swedish parents did a good job raising him.  He had the self confidence to travel to different countries to train.  I liked his descriptions of spices and different restaurants that he either worked at or visited.  If I ever get to New York, I'd love to visit The Red Rooster.  Best wishes for continuing success Marcus!"
863,0,"Quite an interesting story about a person with a highly unusual life: from a short Ethiopian childhood to adoption by spectacularly loving parents a continent away, to the life of a super chef on yet another continent. Meanwhile, we meet a principled human being working to strengthen an American community that has seen decline. All this, and well-written, too. I liked it a lot."
864,0,"Yes, Chef by Marcus Samuelsson"
865,0,"A remarkable story about a man who came from Ethiopia, adopted by Swedish parents, grew to love and had a passion for cooking. Who today is considered a Celebrity Chef in his own right, Marcus Samuelsson."
866,0,"It's All About the Taste, the Taste... Learning the basics of Swedish, German , and French cooking wasn't enough for this chef's palate. He wanted to explore the various cities of all the exciting flavors that each had to offer. As he made his journey he would often write in his journal what flavors would be compatible with certain dishes. Marcus wanted to create food so that the customer could enjoy his dish in that moment and not worry about the everyday world,"
867,0,Reading this novel made me hungry. Chef Samuelsson had a way in describing his many prepared dishes that I could actually visualize what it looked liked to it's  Aromas. People of all cultures can take comfort in food. Food is our communicator that brings people together. No words are expressed just the facial expressions of those enjoying their cuisine says it all.
868,0,Perhaps this memoir should have been titled I'm a Black Chef. Even though this was a well written memoir Samuelsson did focus a great deal of the book to being a black man struggling to become a chef in a white dominated field. I felt he complained about this a bit too much.
869,0,"I have read several memoirs by chefs and believe me this profession is not for the weak at heart. These people eat, breath and live their calling. Ramsey, Puck, White, Reichel and Samuelsson did not become great Chefs by being mediocre. they about killed themselves working and striving to be not just good but by becoming the best!"
870,0,Samuelsson wrote about his background being adopted by a loving Swedish couple. He had a wonderful upbringing and credits his Swedish grandmother giving him his love of food. Later in the book he goes into his Ethiopian birth country. He locates his birth father and several half siblings.
871,0,I've enjoyed watching Samuelsson on the Food Network. I saw when he won Chef Masters and watched him on Chopped as a judge. now I've read his memoir. I admire his dedication and came away again realizing being a Chef is damn hard work!!
872,0,"This book reminded me of Alberto Salazar's memoir on running. I know that sounds odd but it is just another good story on the drive and determination that some immigrants have. Makes me feel a bit lazy at times as a native born American. Marcus has faced a lot of adversity and there are some real high moments for him in his life as well as low. I have read a lot of chef bio's and this one ranks pretty high as a decent read. I love his description of food as he travels and works at many different places around the world. It has inspired me to buy some berbere spice to try on food at home. He talks A LOT about race. Being Caucasian, I knew that a person of different ethnicity might have to think about whether the treatment they receive in life is a result of their color just as easily as it is a result of their personality. But to be honest, I never realized someone could think about it this often. He touches on it probably in every single chapter of the book. Not to say whether this is good or bad, just something I noticed. I would recommend this book to any foodie who might enjoy having a little background knowledge on the people they see on TV."
873,0,"Yes, Chef tells the story of Marcus Samuelsson's life from his adoption as a young boy in Ethiopia to his success opening Red Rooster in Harlem.  Before picking up this book I wasn't a superfan of Samuelsson's, but I had heard him speak at a food conference so I knew he had a compelling life story and this book didn't disappoint."
874,0,"There are a few things that made this book wonderful.  First, it felt very well written and flowed well as a story, so kudos to Veronica Chambers for that.  It definitely held my interest from the first page to the last.  It helps that Samuelsson has an interesting and less than typical life, which for me, made the book interesting and different than other chef memoirs I have read.  I also appreciated how candid the book was.  Samuelsson takes us through some of his biggest triumphs as well as his failures and more humbling moments.  I can understand why that doesn't make him a very likable protagonist to some readers but I thought it made the book feel more real and honest and made me feel like I had a better sense of Samuelsson as a person.  Sure at times he does come across as confident in his abilities, but I also thought it was well balanced by moments of humility and vulnerability.  I also won't disagree with those reviewers who said that he talks about how hard he works a lot, but I took it less as bragging so much as a depiction that being a chef of a high stature doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice. I also can find reading about egomaniacal chefs a turnoff, but Samuelsson didn't strike me as that."
875,0,"Overall, I really, really loved this book.  I found it to be an entertaining read that also made me feel like I understood not only Samuelsson better, but also the world of elite chefs.  I think it a book that foodies will really enjoy and could also see it being enlightening to someone who wants to enter the culinary food."
876,0,"Let me start by saying that I actually bought TWO copies of YES, CHEF ! By Marcus Samuelsson. The first copy was on my Kindle but there were so many ""gems"" and tidbits I wanted to underline (I still prefer a pencil for underlining) that I also bought a hardcover copy.  Marcus Samuelsson has had a very unlikely rise to Chef Stardom.  He was born in Ethiopia but he and his sister were adopted by loving Swedish parents at the tender age of 1.  The first chapter which describes how that came to be, is probably my favorite chapter of the entire book.  It is a truly sad and moving tale. He almost didn't become a Chef as in his own words, his adopted Mother wasn't a cook.  In fact, she hated cooking.  It was seen as a chore.  However, his grandmother loved cooking and Marcus' favorite memories as a Child are the Saturdays he would spend cooking side by side with his grandmother.  This was after Soccer practice - it turns out Soccer is his first and true love. His dream was to be a professional Soccer player but was too slight/short.  In many ways, it is his failure as a Soccer player that fueled his extremely hard work ethic in the Kitchen."
877,0,"Besides winning Top Chef Masters in 2010, he is probably best known as the 3-star Chef of Aquavit in NYC in the mid 90's.  The bulk of the book eloquently describes the windy, grueling path he took to become a World famous Chef.  It was a lot less glamourous than a lot of people would think e.g. his first job involved getting up every morning at 6 AM and scrubbing the walk-in (refrigerator) from top to bottom.  I actually had the pleasure of working in the Pastry Kitchen at Mesa Grill in 1994-1995 and he is right - there is really nothing glamourous about working in a kitchen unless you are the Head Chef (who has had to work many years to get to the top).  Even though the bulk of the book talks about his various restaurant experiences, it is a very personal memoir.  The biggest shocker was that he fathered a daughter when he was 19 years old.  And although he was financially responsible for her well-being (at his Mother's insistence) he wasn't there for her emotionally or physically at all.  I have to say that learning this fact made me really dislike him.  He finally decides to meet her when she is a teenager and hopefully, they have a good relationship now.  The main reason he gives for not being a ""Father"" to her is that he didn't want to be the stereotypical African American male who fosters a child at 19.  In fact, he hides it from all of his employers and most of his friends.  The book touches a lot on the delicate topic of race.  As an Ethiopian who is raised in Sweden then working in NYC, in a field dominated by White males, I don't think he can escape that complex topic.  When he is snubbed by a fancy restaurant (apparently on appearance alone) he writes ""I made it a point not to dwell on the matter of race.  I believed in my knife skills, and my sense of taste, and my capability to listen and get things done. I was never afraid of hard work."""
878,0,"I think the best way to describe both the book and the Chef is dubbing him the ""Berbere"" of Chefs.  Berbere is a very complex spice used in Ethiopian cuisine - among its many ingredients are: chile , black pepper, salt, cardamon, ginger, etc.  Marcus' diverse experiences has made him a very complex man/Chef.  Yes, I really disliked how he treated his own daughter yet I couldn't help warming up to him when he describes how he fought to have his Ethiopian sisters back home get Schooling.  And how he would often take a huge gamble on someone that didn't have the resume to work at a 3-start restaurant.  Or cook the identical meal he served the President of the United States to the neighborhood children in his Harlem apartment.  By the end of the book, I felt very privileged to have had access to such a personal look into that life of a great Chef."
879,0,"Yes Chef delivered everything I hoped it would.  Marcus tells his story in an honest and humble tone from beginning to end.  My copy of this book is covered in little post it arrows where I marked how he prepared truffles (you add them to the sauce at the very end so as not to cook all the flavor out), and his Spanish breakfast (ripe tomatoes peeled and then crushed on toast adding a grind or two of black pepper), and how to make a lobster lasagna.  When curing duck breasts Marcus would soak then in a large pan of salted water with a plate weighing them down for 6 hours."
880,0,Mouth watering yet?
881,0,"And in between pages of mixing seasonings and different flavors is Marcus' story.  Growing up and moving out... restaurant experiences that are detailed from where he got it right, and from when he should have been fired and by grace he was not.  And then into Marcus' life as the one doing the firing and trying to find kitchen held that understood the demands of a kitchen, one employee even telling him,"
882,0,"  ""You can ask me to be on time, iron my shirt, shave or not to wear sneakers, but you can't ask them all of me... it's too much."""
883,0,  ~Page 309 Yes CHEF
884,0,"Yes Chef was interesting and a fun book to read that I will refer to again and again.  Marcus is a true story of battling against the odds, fighting prejudices and coming out on top.  His tips on food throughout the book are things I want to try, things I would have never considered, but when I read Yes CHEF, I felt inspired."
885,0,"Highly recommended to lovers of memoirs, cooking related books and success stories... I loved this book."
886,0,"This is a Chinese classic, which is nicely translated to English. It's an interesting story and provides a glimpse into aristocratic culture in 18th century China."
887,0,"It's a little hard to read, with a staggering number of characters who are referred to by both their names and their informal familiar titles. I gave up trying to keep track of all the characters and decided to power through the book focusing on the main plot and the central characters. For the more patient reader, the book is nicely footnoted, explaining the meaning of the names and the familiar titles, so it is possible to follow the details if you have the patience."
888,0,"Abridged from a multi-volume mid-18-Century novel, this lively retelling captures the essence and the details of life and love in a rich Chinese household. Multiple intrigues and myriad characters mix, some characters disappear, some plots remain unresolved. But there is no complete version, so this greatly shortened rendition is quite satisfactory."
889,0,This is the greatest novel ever published in the Chinese language. A true classic. Perhaps at the same level as Shakespeare. This novel is so highly regarded that entire schools of thought and research have arisen around it.
890,0,In China this is considered a literary classic. I read it because I do business with China and I was told it might make understand their culture better. It really didn't it might of lost something in translation but a good story.
891,0,"Dream of the Red Chamber, written in the 18th century in China, is a book for people who have a particular interest in Chinese culture.  For those of thus who do, we are grateful to have it available.  But for a person just looking for a diverting read, not so much."
892,0,"An interesting read, makes me wish I understood a bit more of the Chinese writing tradition. Would recommend to someone who is interested in great world literature."
893,0,"Chinese version, sorta, of Peyton Place.  An amusing and educational (chinese culture) read.  Discovered this book on a list of texts required for a Chinese literature class."
894,0,"If you don't read another Chinese novel, this one will complete your experience.  It is the quintissential story of family life in China."
895,0,"I needed this book for my east asian civilization class and I was already dreading reading a required book. This book is actually really well written. It deals with chinese legends and myths mix in with fiction. The names in the story can be confusing (you will mix them up) for a Western reader like myself but the book reminds you every so often who everyone is. Please pick up this book, you won't be disappointed."
896,0,a great descriptive story
897,0,"As the SF Opera was featuring an adaptation, I decided to read the Kindle so-called ""abridged"" version of this classic. While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."
898,0,"Be advised, due to type font it's 3 times as long as regular Kindle books of this size. It take's between 1 and 2 hours to read a chapter and there are 56 of them!"
899,0,"Children's book rather than the authentic, adult version classic. Buyer be ware!"
900,0,Bad translation. I have heard great things about this story but could not get past the poor translation.
901,0,"Reminds me of Jane Austin. Interesting peak into Chinese society. Well Ming era anyway.The 2nd book maybe better, I hope."
902,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
903,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
904,0,The Hawkes translation 
905,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
906,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
907,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
908,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
909,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
910,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
911,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
912,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
913,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
914,0,"This is my go-to book for help with my new MacBook Air.  New to Mac after many years on the PC, I was struggling with the changes. I watched the U Tube videos, which were very helpful but I needed print instructions!  This book is easy to follow, clear and concise. Thanks to this help.I am moving along with MACBOOK for DUMMIES"
915,0,"I bought iPad for Dummies a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed reading and using it. This book, although dated July 2014 actually has information in it that is out of date.  Another complaint is that it is printed cheaply, so when I use my yellow highlighter it smudges the page and my highlighter gets ink on it as well from the print.  The iPad for Dummies book had glossy pages, which were  high quality and there was no problem with using a highlighter.  Another problem is that this book is written for a number of different MacBook models so the reader must take in material that is not relevant for one's own model. I was sufficiently frustrated with this book that I went back to see if there are other manuals out there to learn how to use my new MacBook Pro, and I found Teach Yourself Visually MacBook Pro.  So far this is everything that the MacBook Dummies book is not: the pages are glossy, there are lots of color diagrams and photos, and it is specific to the MacBook Pro, so there isn't lots of extraneous information to deal with.  I am not a techy, so perhaps people who are more sophisticated would prefer the Dummies book.  For someone like me, The Teach Yourself Visually MacBook Pro book is ideal, and purchasing this MacBook for Dummies book was a mistake."
916,0,"UPDATE: I am now using both books, since I had already purchased this one. I am finding that they complement one anoher.There is more background information in this one. All the color photos in the Teach Yourself Visually book are more pleasant as well as simple to follow"
917,0,"I had an earlier version of Macbook for Dummies, and am very glad I bought this new version, which tells about all then new cool features with the newest operating system, El Capitan.  I don't have a Macbook Pro YET, but I bought this book and the earlier version several years ago specifically to familiarize myself with Apple laptops before buying one.  This is very well written, and easy to understand.  Mark L. Chambers is one of my favorite Dummies writers for Apple products.  I recommend this new version of Macbook for Dummies."
918,0,"As a longtime Microsoft Windows user (40+ years) I decided to switch to a Mac. Bought me a Macbook Pro notebook and this book. The book has been a welcome transition aid as I have it loaded on my Kindle and the Kindle app. Easy to reference and use. Written in the typical ""for Dummies"" format that I am used to from other editions on other subjects."
919,0,"The MacBook for Dummies is just the book I needed. I am new to the iMac and in my haste to get a ""manual"" (which did not come with the computer ),I ordered this book for Mac laptops for my Kindle. It serves the purpose. It explains the Apple computer in detail so that I can understand it and make it work for me. I was overwhelmed with my new iMac, but  now I have settled down to enjoy it and I really do love the book for making it so easy. It truly is the only ""dummy"" book you will need."
920,0,I've been a fan of Dummies books since Windows 98 and Microsoft Office.  I recently decided to purchase my first Mac and with it the MacBook for Dummies.  I've created a small library of their books and not one has disappointed me.  This book is no exception.  The Mac vs Windows is a bit of a challenge easily handled by the MacBook for Dummies.  Excellent in ever way.  5 star for sure.
921,0,"Great book if you are learning to navigate a MacBook with the new OS High Sierra. I am normally a PC guy, but was able to obtain a great MacBook Pro from my wife. Since I want to keep up with technology, I am increasing my interests in the Mac field too. Frankly, I know some, but not very much. So, this book really comes in handy. It does a great job in covering most of the basic areas you'll be using in a Mac to begin with. Those are the positive comments. The only reason I didn't give this five stars was because of the ""print"" in the book. It looks like it was printed on newspaper print! The lettering is faint and it's very hard to read unless you are near a bright light. If you are in a fairly lit room, it is a bit hard to read it. I think they could have done a better job on paper selection, and the ink or print they used for the book. Other than that, it's a great primer to get started in learning to navigate your MacBook."
922,0,"The first time I used a Macbook to write a message (I was trying to teach myself, after using Microsoft products for years), I learned that the things you need are usually amazingly simple if you already are familiar with the unit, and totally ignored by the ""experts"" who are writing the book for beginners but were not beginners for a very long time. There is absolutely no reference to the fact that if you want to send just a message to someone, you type it without paragraphs, and then hit enter. Probably 90% or more of the users would know this already or manage to hit on it eventually. But some of us just stopped trying to use that feature until we could find someone with a mac."
923,0,"My Macbook is about 10 years old. I went back to Windows, because I don't have time to spend and no modern resources or teachers. So now I am trying to learn to protect my WiFi ... well, I disconnected it until then. That is life. At least I get to learn a little while trying to solve each problem."
924,0,"I bought two books, ""Mac Book For Dummies, Chambers"" and ""OS X El Capitan For Dummies, Levites"". The Chambers book is on cheap paper with no color. The LeVites book is in color and on premium paper. The LeVites book is the better of the two. I recommend that you buy both books and use them for reference. I found the best way to learn MacBook is on video on youtube and using the books as backup and reference."
925,0,"I switched from a PC to a MAC and I had many questions on how to maneuver the operating system. I could go to the Apple Store and meet with a tech but I'd get home and I had even more questions! This book is so handy and it's so easy to find answers to my questions. If you're not used to a MAC, this book is an absolute necessity!!"
926,0,While it might be premature to give full comment on this book because I am yet to read it all up. I must say it is a very good reference book for any Development Studies student or practitioner who is looking to make a sustained difference with development initiatives.  This book was recommended by my Professor and Thesis Supervisor. Its an insightful read on participatory approach to development.
927,0,Good book.

While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."

However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned.

940,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
941,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are ""retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book."" The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature."
942,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
943,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
944,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
945,0,"One of most amazing classic stories I have ever read. A most worthy addition to anyone's library, this story grabs the reader immediately and draws them into the deeply involved and enmeshed lives of a large extended family, revealing both the outer and inner lives of family members in sinuous weaving of interlocked story lines. I just loved this almost magical tale and found myself deliberately slowing down to stay in the story longer. It went a long way to help me to understand the workings if a Chinese multi-generational family for whom devotion to the family good overrides the desires of the individual."
946,0,"The other reviewer wasn't kidding, there really are no spaces for much of the book. No idea how to return a kindle book and I'd advise others to not waste $10 on this!"
947,0,"The printing had no spaces between words, non readable."
948,0,This is one of the very most beautiful works of literature you will find.  The breadth and historical insights that are written about offer important insights and details of Chinese society and family life.  Be ready to seek out time so that you can continue your journey if discovery.
949,0,There were 0 spaces between the words. I returned it.
950,0,"I like reading new takes on traditional fairy tales and this collection by Angela Carter was hair-raising and irreverently funny. Carter gives a modern twist to ten old tales like those of Bluebeard, Little Red Riding Hood and Beauty and the Beast. The stories are written in strong, vivid prose that brings them to life and makes them read like cliff-hangers. Carter’s writing has a bold, sexually suggestive edge that makes more explicit the sexual subtext of the originals. “The Bloody Chamber” is a pulse-racing revision of the Bluebeard legend, and “Puss in Boots” had me laughing out loud at the bravado of the randy old cat."
951,0,"Some of my favorite women writers (Emma Donoghue and Sarah Waters, for instance) cite the English writer Angela Carter as a big influence on their writing. Ms. Carter passed away at age 51 in 1992. I’ve wanted to explore her writing and this short story collection was a great place to start. I look forward to reading some of her other stories and novels.  Emma Donoghue, by the way, wrote her own feminist version of fairy tales called "
952,0,. It has a very different tone from this book by Carter but anyone who likes this would probably enjoy reading Donoghue's book as well.
953,0,"I love the writing of  Angela carter.  These retelling of fairy tales offers a glimpse of what is concealed.  Here is why girls are warned not to walk through the woods.  Wolves yes; human potentials to harm, human potential for teeth; it is honest bold, stepped of veneers that cover up truths some do not want exposed, but this is really who we are.  Angela Carter's mirror system is dead-on accurate.  Everything you did not want to know, but suspected.  And in the ""Bloody Chamber,"" Angela Carter is not afraid to tell it with brilliance and charm; it all seems regal.  Full of exuberance for the ragged existences necessary for happiness and authentic  passion: it bites."
954,0,I didn't know a lot going into this book. Had never read anything by Angela Carter before.
955,0,"First off, this writing is SEXY. Second, the audio book version is even SEXIER(the narrators Emilia Fox and Richard Armitage are beautiful choices)."
956,0,These tales are retellings of classic fairytales and it takes them back to the more gothic-y horror feel that they originated with.
957,0,I originally go this as an audio book and LOVED IT! So then I purchased this 75th Anniversary Edition to keep on my shelf. I reread it as soon as I got it. Her writing is absolutely beautiful.
958,0,"I'm only giving it 5 stars because the messages conveyed and how well written it is. However, I'm not a fan of the material nearly as much as I wanted to be. I understand that feminist novelists need to emphasize characteristics that break away from androcentrism, but I can do without the heavy sexually explicit scenes of most stories in this book. It's just personal taste, not a judgment on quality. Angela Carter is amazing and has helped usher many minds in a positive direction. My support goes to the cause and her writing."
959,0,"For years, since I heard of the works of the late Angela Carter, I've wanted to get this book in my hands. Some time ago, I managed to obtain a digital copy of it, and after reading it over and over, I knew I had to buy it."
960,0,"However, because this book is virtually impossible to buy in my country, I had to search it here, and for some reason, the cover arts I saw in other edition weren't my cup of tea. This one, on the other hand, caught my eye as soon as I saw it. The wraparound art is gorgeousm, and I lamented that the book didn't include illustrations for the stories, which are still as enjoyable as when I read them for the first time."
961,0,"On the stories themselves: As many reviewers (and Carter herself) said: these stories are not adaptations of classic fairy tales (from Perrault and the Brothers Grimm with some european folklore, to be exact) but more like clever revisitations of them, written with a rich, sometimes baroque (perhaps too ornamented for some readers) language, where one is transported not just to the tales themselves, but to Carter's world: a realm where young girls become aware of themselves as sexual and self-sufficient beings, where beasts (specially wolves) can be husbands or lovers, where mothers and pets are saviors, and where blood runs like water."
962,0,"Yes, The Bloody Chamber may be considered as feminist fiction, but don't be scared, those of you who fear the F-word: While Carter was a feminist, she was one that didn't take herself seriously to the point of being Politically Correct or pretending to create a thin-veiled pamphlet with The Bloody Chamber; in fact, many of the words and situations in her stories might upset of the most sensitive readers (violent sex, explicit sex, nudity, necrophilia, animal and human escathology, and of course murder), and even those readers who aren't into any wave of feminism may enjoy several of the stories. After all, the works of Carter inspired several famous writers nowadays, such as Neil Gaiman, J.K. Rowling, Salman Rushdie, Kelly Link (who wrote the foreword to this Anniversary Edition) among many others."
963,0,"There is one negative detail I must mention for those who want to buy this edition: When mine arrived, the edges of some of the pages weren't smooth but with a rough texture, like from a pulp edition (Mind you, the pages themselves were okay, the printed words looked in good conditions, the diagramation was in order, and none of them was torn). So, if you are fastidious with details like these when you order a book, you may want to think twice before buying it online, and going to a bookstore and checking the pages yourself instead."
964,0,"Other than that, The Bloody Chamber is the best and most known of Angela Carter's work on fiction, so if you like fantasy stories with the dark edge that characterized old fairytales, you can it give it a try."
965,0,"I'll admit that I was a somewhat reluctant reader of The Bloody Chamber. I'd purchased it for a class and then ended up not needing to read it. I have a strange personal tradition, though, of reading one piece of horror fiction at Christmas time (a tradition that began in junior high when I happened to read J. Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla--a vampire tale that Carter references in The Bloody Chamber), and when this was what I had on the shelf come Christmas-time, I gave it a go."
966,0,"I'll admit, too, that I was a little ambivalent about it when I began the first couple of stories. The stories tend to follow a pattern of opening with a long flood of elaborate, creepy descriptions before finally moving on to the story, and the language throughout the collection is not difficult, but is allusive, sometimes tortuous, and always ornate. It all, to be honest, felt overwritten."
967,0,"But at the same time, after slogging through the opening of the first couple stories, I would reach the ending to find that the story opened up and culminated in something that was just startling. I won't give away any endings, but many of them, such as ""The Werewolf"" and ""The Tiger's Bride,"" leave you with images that shock your intellect, and linger. And some of them, such as ""The Bloody Chamber"" and ""The Courtship of Mr Lyon,"" end just beautifully. ""The Bloody Chamber,"" especially, ends thrillingly, with the women of the story rejecting the passive roles typically assigned to them in fairy tales (this one based on Blue Beard) and washing the story in a beautiful bath of blood, in the process reshaping and reconstituting their community."
968,0,"By the end of the book, Carter had totally won me over, and The Bloody Chamber's aspects that had seemed overwritten, instead, felt right. It felt like Carter had word-by-word constructed a concrete aesthetic world, an enormous gothic mansion complete with more than a few torture chambers and plenty of hidden passages still there to be explored. The Bloody Chamber was a fantastic book that I expect to enjoy even more on future readings."
969,0,"Angela Carter set out for the odd task of rewriting fairy tales as (mostly) horror stories with a feminist slant.  She succeeds quite well, with most stories in here being great and even the low points being pretty good.  Probably the best versions of both the Bluebeard and Puss in Boots stories ever put to paper."
970,0,"It's brisk read, and a classic for a reason.  Check it out."
971,0,"Angela Carter died far too soon, at the age of 55, but she left behind this astonishing collection of tales (her choice of words) inspired by a lifelong love of fairy and folktales, first heard from her Scottish grandmother.  Carter's artistry dazzles, delights, and disturbs; she brings to the surface the latent erotic content of many traditional fairytales and subverts their didactic messages.  (For example, the tale of Bluebeard on which Carter's title story is based, was intended to teach young woman the dangers of ""female curiosity,"" while apparently unconcerned with the need to comment on the dangers of ""male homicidal impulses."")  But have no fear:  Carter never grinds her axes--her wonderful stories are meant first of all to enthrall and to entertain in the best sense of that word.  It's the 75th anniversary of her birth and Penguin has come out with a new commemorative edition of this unforgettable collection of short fiction:  no better time to become acquainted with one of the greatest fabulists who ever lived--I only wish she could have gone on writing for decades longer."
972,0,"I bought this for class. The professor LOVES this author. I haven't enjoyed the stories very much, really don't see the appeal here, but if you like twists on classic fairy tales then you may enjoy this. Some of the stories, I just didn't get, and the professor admitted she didn't either. Still, she loves this author and everything she writes."
973,0,"Although adult reworkings of fairy tales are a dime a dozen today, Carter’s collection which helped launch the sub genre is well worth the read. I researched the originals and found that for many the horrific touch was more a restoration than alteration... many of our most beloved and seemingly innocent fairy tales have darker roots. Sex and death are at times at variance and at other times in collusion, and female agency saves the day in a number of the stories... no trembling distressed damsels here! On top of all this, Carter’s prose is beautiful, loaded with stunning imagery."
974,0,"Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding ""Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad."""
975,0,...ah! I love learning about other cultures!
976,0,"But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly (""Who the heck is this person again?"" I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time."
977,0,"Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him)."
978,0,"But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work...."
979,0,...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.
980,0,"This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China (""Red Studies,"" from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, ""A Dream of Red Mansions""). It really should be read by every educated person."
981,0,"  The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however."
982,0,"  I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature."
983,0,"  The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note."
984,0,"  First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women)."
985,0,"  Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses."
986,0,"  Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead."
987,0,"  Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure."
988,0,"  Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others."
989,0,  There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.
990,0,"  Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia."
991,0,"For people that are accustomed to the cultures of the West (Americas, Europe) it might be a chore to get interested in this book. The pace seems to be a little slow but that is because the details of daily life in China days past are different and they might just slip right past you. If you're interested in how life was lived in that part of the world, this book will be a masterpiece, as it has been in China itself."
992,0,"One of the masterpieces of Chinese literature.  Five volumes and hundreds of characters. Has a modern feel, despite being more than two hundred years old. Fascinating book."
993,0,"Rank and privilege in 18th century China. The family compound. Relation between relatives and the pecking order. The state loses meaning at extended family level which tend to have their own laws and customs. Subjection of women is rife, but not without protest. This book about customs is worth more than a history book in order to understand how people lived.  This is not a history book, it is a novel of customs, more about  what people thought, about respect, subservience and privilege  and mores."
994,0,"One of the 4 classics of Chinese literature, it is a riveting and interesting read! Especially useful for someone who is keen to have a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature. Highly recommended."
995,0,The book looks very aged/old with yellow pages. Disappointed
996,0,This book is one of the celebrated classics in Chinese literature. The English translation here is very good. Even the poetry is well done
997,0,"The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!  (I find Pinyon names much easier to read)."
998,0,A fascinating look at prerevolutionary China.

1000,0,"A unique and troubled time in America's past when dollars were more important than workers lives or the health of the natural environment. Coal barons raped the landscape, tore up the mountains, spoiled the rivers, treated miners and their families horribly and pretty much did what they darn well pleased."
1001,0,This is a great new translation of one of the most significant classic Chinese novels. An 18th Century Saga of a noble family that falls from grace.

1017,0,"It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine."
1018,0,"I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures."
1019,0,"Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher."
1020,0,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize."
1021,0,"I slogged through, and found the stories engaging, the descriptions of the culture fascinating, and the plotlines very different from western stories. The time invested in completing the series was a joy. Thankfully, a glossary of individual names, relationships, and even the family trees for the families most involved appears in each volume. I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book."
1022,0,"It's usually difficult to find all five volumes, so I thank Amazon for pulling the Penguin versions together."
1023,0,"Nothing good lasts forever, whether we are talking about the Garden or this novel itself… Volumes 4 and 5 are thought to be written by Gao E a generation after Cao Xueqin’s untimely death.  There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s."
1024,0,"Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days."
1025,0,"When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point."
1026,0,David Hawke's English translation is probably the best version of this Chinese classic published so far. Item arrived in reasonable condition.
1027,0,Contains the Dream of the Red Chamber
1028,0,"This is the point where the author had left off and his friends subsequently pieced together his notes and drafts.  The story becomes quickly incredibly depressing, all presaged in the preceding volumes but still.  it is realistically done and vivid but the story, and its characters, lose a lot of their charm.  They pay their debt of tears, with interest."

1032,0,I should like to return this book because it is smaller by 1/2 inch in perimeter than the other 4 volumes of the same book I acquired through Amazon.  I'd like the volumes to match in size.

1035,0,From Emily D. (pen name)
1036,0,"It truly is a challenge to find a well written Christian novel.  I've only found a few and this is one of them. I don't know who the protagonist, Will Chambers, is modeled after or if he's a composite, but I would like to meet him or them! He is a very brilliant, insightful attorney. The story expertly combines Will's natural abilities with God's supernatural interventions, weaving them together to hold the reader's attention until the story is resolved on the final page!"
1037,0,"Grabbed from the beginning, this novel held me throughout. If you’re a lesser us better when it comes to government, this will drive you nuts. I found myself so engrossed with the drama unfolding that I began to join in with Will as he fights the system which had gone off the rails. A must read from an author who truly engages his readers."
1038,0,"As far as I'm concerned,  Mr. Parshall is #1 in the legal thriller  genre; better than John  Grisham.  He expertly weaves his stories through twists, turns and surprises. This story really carried me quickly through to the end. I read it in one day. I love that he includes Christianity in his books. His faith adds so much depth to the story. I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. As a former legal secretary,  I'm always fascinated by legal thrillers."
1039,0,"This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall.  As with the first one, this is well done."
1040,0,The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse.  There are many twists and turns throughout.  The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.
1041,0,"In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues.  The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline.  That part is well done also."
1042,0,"I will certainly be checking out more books in this series.  I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection."
1043,0,This is an excellent thriller series. Lots of action. You will not want to put it down. Read them in order.
1044,0,The premise is scary. This is an engrossing book I recommend you read this when you have a lot of time to read it
1045,0,"Enjoyed this one as much as the first book in the series.  Holds your interest.  And the characters are very ""real""."
1046,0,I look forward to the read. Thanks
1047,0,EXCELLENT READ. Would like to believe a lawyer could have this much feeling for jusice and the truth.
1048,0,"Of the five books in this series, I've only read the first two.  This book was more enjoyable than the first. I didn't want to put it down."
1049,0,"As the SF Opera was featuring an adaptation, I decided to read the Kindle so-called ""abridged"" version of this classic. While the beautiful writing depicts the intricacies and dynamics of that era, the constant repetition became boring. Nevertheless, I persevered till thankfully the end. Thank goodness for Kindle as the archaic writing style allowed me to look up words on practically every page."
1050,0,"Be advised, due to type font it's 3 times as long as regular Kindle books of this size. It take's between 1 and 2 hours to read a chapter and there are 56 of them!"

1052,0,Bad translation. I have heard great things about this story but could not get past the poor translation.

1054,0,"This is a tough read. It is apparently a well known book in China, but in translation it is nearly incomprehensible."
1055,0,translation too direct very Asian style of construction and words used
1056,0,The Hawkes translation 
1057,0," is probably the most enjoyable for English readers, though in some ways it is maybe over-adapted.  The Yang translation "
1058,0, is more literal.  This Joly translation is the most literal and even contains some explicit parenthetic explanations of various Chinese terms.  It is awkwardly literal sometimes.
1059,0,Few readers will be in this position: but if you want an English translation to help you with the Chinese original this is probably the best.  Yang is just about as helpful.
1060,0,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel ""Dream of the Red Chamber"", now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website."
1061,0,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber,"" and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you."
1062,0,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of.

1066,0,"The pacing was done like how a seasoned Executive Chef presents a meal, none too ironic for a chef skilled at MIXIN’ Flava’, staking his worth in creating ‘that’ signature dish, who has led kitchens cooking for the Obamas not once, but at least twice. Guess I must now try that ‘foie gras ganache. I’m saying, this memoir is packed with flavor."
1067,0,"Overall, delivering a memoir that pulls on all the senses, from the choices Marcus made selecting friends, his lessons learned acknowledging mistakes, his passion for cooking, which includes a broad professional culinary education, along with sacrifices he’s taken on... like the many people he’s mentored...near and far, none more so than his half sisters, makes Yes, Chef a phenomenal treat to experience! Absolutely redeemable. Highly recommended. Simply a Must!"
1068,0,"Ordered this as a Kindle daily deal, and had to put everything on hold for 2 days while I finished it. A fascinating story of one man's journey from being a 2-year-old tubercular Ethiopian orphan to a ""celebrity chef."" Fascinating peak behind the scenes at top restaurants and what it takes to be a ""star"" chef. In some ways a brutally honest book. Samuelsson doesn't always come out the hero. He is ambitious, driven, and single-minded,sometimes to his detriment. But he also shows great insight about the journey that has brought him to where he is now, a gift that may be as rare as the kind of talent he has. I noticed that some of the more negative reviews focus on the fact that the reader likes Samuelsson less after reading the book. Fair enough, but I would argue that discovering that someone you admire has some flaws, while disappointing, doesn't mean the book is bad. The writing is good. The story-telling engaging. Those qualities make it worth the read."
1069,0,"I enjoyed this book a lot.  I was hooked from the first page.  His life story is unreal being adopted from Ethiopia by a loving Swedish couple.  He enjoyed helping his Swedish grandmother in the kitchen.  His original choice of a career would have been as a soccer player and he was good but he was not tall.  He then turned to food.  I enjoyed learning how hard one has to work to become a good chef.  His Swedish parents did a good job raising him.  He had the self confidence to travel to different countries to train.  I liked his descriptions of spices and different restaurants that he either worked at or visited.  If I ever get to New York, I'd love to visit The Red Rooster.  Best wishes for continuing success Marcus!"
1070,0,"Quite an interesting story about a person with a highly unusual life: from a short Ethiopian childhood to adoption by spectacularly loving parents a continent away, to the life of a super chef on yet another continent. Meanwhile, we meet a principled human being working to strengthen an American community that has seen decline. All this, and well-written, too. I liked it a lot."
1071,0,"Yes, Chef by Marcus Samuelsson"
1072,0,"A remarkable story about a man who came from Ethiopia, adopted by Swedish parents, grew to love and had a passion for cooking. Who today is considered a Celebrity Chef in his own right, Marcus Samuelsson."
1073,0,"It's All About the Taste, the Taste... Learning the basics of Swedish, German , and French cooking wasn't enough for this chef's palate. He wanted to explore the various cities of all the exciting flavors that each had to offer. As he made his journey he would often write in his journal what flavors would be compatible with certain dishes. Marcus wanted to create food so that the customer could enjoy his dish in that moment and not worry about the everyday world,"
1074,0,Reading this novel made me hungry. Chef Samuelsson had a way in describing his many prepared dishes that I could actually visualize what it looked liked to it's  Aromas. People of all cultures can take comfort in food. Food is our communicator that brings people together. No words are expressed just the facial expressions of those enjoying their cuisine says it all.
1075,0,Perhaps this memoir should have been titled I'm a Black Chef. Even though this was a well written memoir Samuelsson did focus a great deal of the book to being a black man struggling to become a chef in a white dominated field. I felt he complained about this a bit too much.
1076,0,"I have read several memoirs by chefs and believe me this profession is not for the weak at heart. These people eat, breath and live their calling. Ramsey, Puck, White, Reichel and Samuelsson did not become great Chefs by being mediocre. they about killed themselves working and striving to be not just good but by becoming the best!"
1077,0,Samuelsson wrote about his background being adopted by a loving Swedish couple. He had a wonderful upbringing and credits his Swedish grandmother giving him his love of food. Later in the book he goes into his Ethiopian birth country. He locates his birth father and several half siblings.
1078,0,I've enjoyed watching Samuelsson on the Food Network. I saw when he won Chef Masters and watched him on Chopped as a judge. now I've read his memoir. I admire his dedication and came away again realizing being a Chef is damn hard work!!
1079,0,"This book reminded me of Alberto Salazar's memoir on running. I know that sounds odd but it is just another good story on the drive and determination that some immigrants have. Makes me feel a bit lazy at times as a native born American. Marcus has faced a lot of adversity and there are some real high moments for him in his life as well as low. I have read a lot of chef bio's and this one ranks pretty high as a decent read. I love his description of food as he travels and works at many different places around the world. It has inspired me to buy some berbere spice to try on food at home. He talks A LOT about race. Being Caucasian, I knew that a person of different ethnicity might have to think about whether the treatment they receive in life is a result of their color just as easily as it is a result of their personality. But to be honest, I never realized someone could think about it this often. He touches on it probably in every single chapter of the book. Not to say whether this is good or bad, just something I noticed. I would recommend this book to any foodie who might enjoy having a little background knowledge on the people they see on TV."
1080,0,"Yes, Chef tells the story of Marcus Samuelsson's life from his adoption as a young boy in Ethiopia to his success opening Red Rooster in Harlem.  Before picking up this book I wasn't a superfan of Samuelsson's, but I had heard him speak at a food conference so I knew he had a compelling life story and this book didn't disappoint."
1081,0,"There are a few things that made this book wonderful.  First, it felt very well written and flowed well as a story, so kudos to Veronica Chambers for that.  It definitely held my interest from the first page to the last.  It helps that Samuelsson has an interesting and less than typical life, which for me, made the book interesting and different than other chef memoirs I have read.  I also appreciated how candid the book was.  Samuelsson takes us through some of his biggest triumphs as well as his failures and more humbling moments.  I can understand why that doesn't make him a very likable protagonist to some readers but I thought it made the book feel more real and honest and made me feel like I had a better sense of Samuelsson as a person.  Sure at times he does come across as confident in his abilities, but I also thought it was well balanced by moments of humility and vulnerability.  I also won't disagree with those reviewers who said that he talks about how hard he works a lot, but I took it less as bragging so much as a depiction that being a chef of a high stature doesn't come without hard work and sacrifice. I also can find reading about egomaniacal chefs a turnoff, but Samuelsson didn't strike me as that."
1082,0,"Overall, I really, really loved this book.  I found it to be an entertaining read that also made me feel like I understood not only Samuelsson better, but also the world of elite chefs.  I think it a book that foodies will really enjoy and could also see it being enlightening to someone who wants to enter the culinary food."
1083,0,"Let me start by saying that I actually bought TWO copies of YES, CHEF ! By Marcus Samuelsson. The first copy was on my Kindle but there were so many ""gems"" and tidbits I wanted to underline (I still prefer a pencil for underlining) that I also bought a hardcover copy.  Marcus Samuelsson has had a very unlikely rise to Chef Stardom.  He was born in Ethiopia but he and his sister were adopted by loving Swedish parents at the tender age of 1.  The first chapter which describes how that came to be, is probably my favorite chapter of the entire book.  It is a truly sad and moving tale. He almost didn't become a Chef as in his own words, his adopted Mother wasn't a cook.  In fact, she hated cooking.  It was seen as a chore.  However, his grandmother loved cooking and Marcus' favorite memories as a Child are the Saturdays he would spend cooking side by side with his grandmother.  This was after Soccer practice - it turns out Soccer is his first and true love. His dream was to be a professional Soccer player but was too slight/short.  In many ways, it is his failure as a Soccer player that fueled his extremely hard work ethic in the Kitchen."
1084,0,"Besides winning Top Chef Masters in 2010, he is probably best known as the 3-star Chef of Aquavit in NYC in the mid 90's.  The bulk of the book eloquently describes the windy, grueling path he took to become a World famous Chef.  It was a lot less glamourous than a lot of people would think e.g. his first job involved getting up every morning at 6 AM and scrubbing the walk-in (refrigerator) from top to bottom.  I actually had the pleasure of working in the Pastry Kitchen at Mesa Grill in 1994-1995 and he is right - there is really nothing glamourous about working in a kitchen unless you are the Head Chef (who has had to work many years to get to the top).  Even though the bulk of the book talks about his various restaurant experiences, it is a very personal memoir.  The biggest shocker was that he fathered a daughter when he was 19 years old.  And although he was financially responsible for her well-being (at his Mother's insistence) he wasn't there for her emotionally or physically at all.  I have to say that learning this fact made me really dislike him.  He finally decides to meet her when she is a teenager and hopefully, they have a good relationship now.  The main reason he gives for not being a ""Father"" to her is that he didn't want to be the stereotypical African American male who fosters a child at 19.  In fact, he hides it from all of his employers and most of his friends.  The book touches a lot on the delicate topic of race.  As an Ethiopian who is raised in Sweden then working in NYC, in a field dominated by White males, I don't think he can escape that complex topic.  When he is snubbed by a fancy restaurant (apparently on appearance alone) he writes ""I made it a point not to dwell on the matter of race.  I believed in my knife skills, and my sense of taste, and my capability to listen and get things done. I was never afraid of hard work."""
1085,0,"I think the best way to describe both the book and the Chef is dubbing him the ""Berbere"" of Chefs.  Berbere is a very complex spice used in Ethiopian cuisine - among its many ingredients are: chile , black pepper, salt, cardamon, ginger, etc.  Marcus' diverse experiences has made him a very complex man/Chef.  Yes, I really disliked how he treated his own daughter yet I couldn't help warming up to him when he describes how he fought to have his Ethiopian sisters back home get Schooling.  And how he would often take a huge gamble on someone that didn't have the resume to work at a 3-start restaurant.  Or cook the identical meal he served the President of the United States to the neighborhood children in his Harlem apartment.  By the end of the book, I felt very privileged to have had access to such a personal look into that life of a great Chef."
1086,0,"Yes Chef delivered everything I hoped it would.  Marcus tells his story in an honest and humble tone from beginning to end.  My copy of this book is covered in little post it arrows where I marked how he prepared truffles (you add them to the sauce at the very end so as not to cook all the flavor out), and his Spanish breakfast (ripe tomatoes peeled and then crushed on toast adding a grind or two of black pepper), and how to make a lobster lasagna.  When curing duck breasts Marcus would soak then in a large pan of salted water with a plate weighing them down for 6 hours."
1087,0,Mouth watering yet?
1088,0,"And in between pages of mixing seasonings and different flavors is Marcus' story.  Growing up and moving out... restaurant experiences that are detailed from where he got it right, and from when he should have been fired and by grace he was not.

1091,0,"Yes Chef was interesting and a fun book to read that I will refer to again and again.  Marcus is a true story of battling against the odds, fighting prejudices and coming out on top.  His tips on food throughout the book are things I want to try, things I would have never considered, but when I read Yes CHEF, I felt inspired."

1094,0,"A unique and troubled time in America's past when dollars were more important than workers lives or the health of the natural environment. Coal barons raped the landscape, tore up the mountains, spoiled the rivers, treated miners and their families horribly and pretty much did what they darn well pleased."
1095,0,"Stephen King's Dark Tower epic is easily one of my favorite fantasy series of all time.  It features a wonderful world mixing pretty much my two favorite things:  the world-building of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings & the imagery of Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy.  Unfortunately, I hadn't ever owned the complete series; I read them either through libraries, online or from friends. Having them all in one place where I can burn all my money in one go and re-read them again and again and again is the perfect gift to myself.  I'm not usually a fan of movie tie-in editions, but here it isn't distracting since it still features original covers (not movie stills).  You just have to see Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey's name on the box.  Overall if you've never owned the complete set then this is a fantastic investment.  If you've never read the series and are thinking about buying it on a whim, all I can say that is if you love fantasy, westerns, sci-fi, horror, epic adventure, and characters that you'll never want to stop traveling with, then stop reading this right now and hit the ""order"" button."
1096,0,"I actually bought this as a gift for my dad, who reads constantly but does not tend to read fantasy, horror, or Stephen King. He told me it would be a while until he got started on the series because of deadlines (he's retired but still writes textbooks). Two days later he told me, jokingly, that he was very mad at me for getting him hooked on this series, as he has been unable to put the books down and binged the first 3 novels in 2 days, ignoring deadlines and emails and probably the various chores my mom assigned him. =D"
1097,0,"Got me thru 3 months of segregation in prison.... Great read for those doing a decent amount of time... Glad I had the time.... Only in prison can u read so much so quick, usually uninterrupted, that I couldn't imagine trying to finish this whole  series in the world, unless jobless or Idk.... But you should get in tune with this one!"
1098,0,"I bought this for my granddaughter.  I loved the fact I did not have to track down all of the books to purchase them.  She started with a book in the middle of the series without realizing she was reading out of sequence.  She did enjoy the book, so I decided to treat her to an exciting adventure that only author Stephen King can spin.  It was a mixture of an old western, some 14th century chivalry and good old fashioned on the edge of your seat reading.  The Stand was my favorite book, but this one definitely came in a close second.  This is totally worth the price of the set."
1099,0,Read the 1st three books when they came out. Got the box set a month ago and read the series start to finish in about 3 weeks. Over all I enjoyed the books although I found more than a few errors and inconsistencies. If I reread the series again in a few years I will outline them even though I'm sure no one cares. Great story telling over all.
1100,0,My son-in-law encouraged me for years to read this series. He read it when the books first came out and mentioned having to re-read some of the books to put it all together. That's why I hesitated reading it. I received the boxed set for Christmas and began my reading adventure. I believe it was easier to read as a complete series than over many years. As I read I learned so much about the author that helps me to understand Stephen King and that makes his books a better read. King's books are on so many different levels anyway and the Dark Tower series is even more yet. I loved how he made himself part of the story and told of his problems completing the series. I am at a loss now what to do tomorrow since I finished reading Dark Tower tonight. It's a true separation anxiety.
1101,0,"I bought the Dark Tower Book series used so I was expecting a little wear and tear.  The books I received look brand new! There are no signs of wear and seeing as how they are going to be a bday gift, I believe he is going to be so impressed with the collection."
1102,0,Bought this boxed set for my son for Xmas.  he loves it.  Great story and very well done as far as packaging and appearance.  The copies are new and in excellent condition.  the boxed set shipped in a larger box that they took the time to insulate again damaged.  Nice to know they took the time to protect their product against shipping damage.
1103,0,I am impressed. There's only one insignificant detail on the copy of the waste lands as I display in the photo but it isn't a problem for me and the bookset is flawless besides that.
1104,0,"  I went through every copy and every page and they smell like fresh print and there are no dents or scratches, which I was not expecting. For the price, the quality is 5 stars. I asked some questions to the seller about the publication and they replied immediately with a thorough answer that was very helpful."
1105,0,"  I highly recommend buying from this seller. High quality product, excellent customer support, and incredibly low price. PS- if you're having trouble removing books from the bookcase; they give you three cardboard sheets which serve as sliders. You insert them on each side of the book you're removing and the book simply slides out as displayed in the photo above."
1106,0,"On third book and enjoying the story, glad I got the whole set."
1107,0,"This is a masterful approach to the primary themes and characters of the greatest of all Chinese novels. THE STORY OF THE STONE runs five (thick) volumes in length, has literally hundreds of characters, takes place in a very specific historical era, and mirrors both the religious and social practices of the time and also the broader political landscape in which the story takes place. I managed to love it the first time I read it even though I knew almost nothing about any of that, but successive readings have given me hundreds of questions, and this book has helped me find many answers. I'm not a scholar, so what matters to me is that this book, tough sledding though it can be at times, actually increases my enjoyment of one of my three or four favorite novels."
1108,0,The editors made an inspired decision to aim this volume at both teachers and researchers. The result is a veritable treasure-trove of pedagogical insights and scholarship.
1109,0,I bought this for a friend after reading my copy of the 1975 (I think) edition with the pages turning yellow. It's like medicine. Everyone who struggles with the idea that God is a God of love should read this. Excellent Biblical perspective on how God's love can be known even in the painful experiences of life. Why God's love isn't obvious on the basis of casual observation. Impossible to understand without faith in Jesus Christ.
1110,0,"I feel like this is a preacher who is preaching the deep, meat of the Lord's heart.....Oswald Chambers is my favorite!  Every paragraph has a compelling and truthful thought."
1111,0,Oswald Chambers teachings are always challenging but the challenge is always good to bring us back to the word of God.
1112,0,Fabulous book. I've read it three times and keep reading it. Oswald Chambers was really a wonderful godly man. Very deep
1113,0,Oswald chambers has taught me a depth of the he bible that has been astoundingly beautiful. He is the one person including his precious wife that I can't wait tp see I'm heaven. His love of Christ and his devotion to our Lord is sweet fragrance of heaven!
1114,0,As usual Oswald makes you think!!
1115,0,Anything O Chambers writes is dynamite
1116,0,Great amounts of wisdom in this book. Oswald never disappoints with his writing. Definitely worth a read and definitely a book I will read multiple times throughout life!
1117,0,"Awesome book, and anything Oswald Chambers writes is annointed by the Holy Spirit. You will see a man dying to flesh to write HIS heart out."
1118,0,I love anything by Oswald Chambers and it makes an excellent gift for anyone that needs an insight to the word of God.
1119,0,"I purchased this for my brother as a Christmas gift. Like me, he is a book collector, and has been wanting the first volume of this title, ""A Dream of Red Mansions"" for some time now (he already has Volumes 2 and 3). I purchased this book through a third party vendor here on Amazon and the book arrived intact and in excellent, almost new condition. It is a hardcover, printed in China, and is the first edition. The book contains some beautiful color illustrations depicting important scenes from the book. A classic of Chinese literature, this is a story that will appeal to readers keen to explore the diversity in world literature."
1120,0,"This is one of the most interesting and profound novels I have read, a masterpiece of Chinese literature and a world class contribution. I genuinely enjoyed this translation of this 250-year old novel. The text flowed well and was clear and understandable.  The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature. The descriptions and characterization are so realistic you feel as if you have known those people and places for years. I would say this is a must-read!"
1121,0,"I am studying Chinese and but my reading is not good enough to be able to read the original of this famous classic novel.  What I really liked about this edition was having Chinese and English face to face, which helps me practice reading my Chinese.  The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.  The 6 volumes are thick and heavy, and we are treated to a full page illustration in the style of Chinese painting every other chapter.  That's about 60 paintings."
1122,0,"The reason I give it a star less is the prevalence of typos.  You're likely to encounter one every page or every few pages.  Most were obvious and easy to correct, but it was rather annoying.  A little more quality control in the typesetting would have helped."
1123,0,"It will take a while to finish, but I love the book so far!"
1124,0,"Present Chinese culture rests on seven pillars. One of these is the sayings of Kung Fu Tse, the others are found embodied in the ""Four Classics"", of which this is one. An easy read, an easy interpretation. Highly recommend for any traveler, and those who want to understand our Oriental Neighbor."
1125,0,I read this book second of the 4 classics (or 5 depending on who you speak to)
1126,0,"It was like watching a long, slow soap opera. The descriptions of food, clothing, and gifts were amazing."
1127,0,Just the long chapters discussing house politics and Baoyu's aloofness made me force myself to finish.
1128,0,"The ending was really good, and somewhat unexpected."
1129,0,"Romanization schemes for Chinese are notoriously imperfect, if for no other reasons than that 4 tones -- 5 if you count a null tone sometimes used -- are not immediately obvious to those who do not have a speaking knowledge of any of the Chinese dialects."
1130,0,"Perhaps I am prejudiced, having learned Chinese primarily using texts that happened to (mostly) rely on the Pinyin system.  However, it seems to me that Pinyin has the distinct merit of adhering most closely to the principles of most of the primary European languages (especially Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages) where vowel sounds are far more regular and predictable than they are in English, particularly."
1131,0,"I can't comment (yet) on this particular translation, though I am working through several other bilingual editions that are part of the same Foreign Language Press publication project, and can give a few early impressions based on what I've read so far."
1132,0,"These translations are commendable in that they seek to provide a full translation of the works in question, thereby attempting to avoid some of the cultural ""hyperbole"" that has been attached to some of these works by translators approaching the texts from outside the context of Chinese culture.  As a native-born speaker of English, I did not begin studying Chinese until my late teens and will never have the complete understanding of the culture to argue persuasively over the finer points of these translations."
1133,0,"However, on the intuitive side, I do not a certain defensiveness at times and an effort to provide translations that are either culturally acceptable to present-day political realities in the Chinese mainland regions, or that may simply be dodging some of the tougher editorial calls to be made."
1134,0,"It is very clear, especially in some of the introductory matter that accompanies many texts in this series, that the final English version was approved by someone not a native speaker of idiomatic English.  In most cases, the evidence appears in simple errors of literal translation of phrases that make perfect idiomatic sense in Chinese, but, rendered with too much literal faithfulness, are puzzling to say the least when they are rendered in English."
1135,0,"I would agree with others who've commented that these texts are probably best for someone whose knowledge of Chinese is limited and is looking for an English ""crib sheet"" for entering into the Chinese originals (or in some cases, modern Chinese renditions of Classical Chinese texts, as in FLP's 2 volume translation of the works of Zhuangzi).  Note, however, that the FLP translation of Zhuangzi is (unless I'm mistaken) the most complete translation presently available in English, and this is true of many other texts in the FLP's publishing project)."
1136,0,"As a student of Chinese language, I really don't care much what romanization method is used.  They are all far from ideal.  What I care about is that someone is making these texts available in English, even if the translations are not always the most poetic -- where poetry is called for."
1137,0,"I love this story, I have read several different translated versions and this one seems to cover the most in a very condensed paper back. The Original book is over 5000 pages I think and that is before the follow up author took it upon himself to finish the 1835 original unfinished work. Le's put it this way there are several movies the most recent with English sub titles is 28 episodes each an hour and a half long"
1138,0,"I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone. Join the ""Redists"", as the admirers of this book are officially called.... You'll find in it surprises of all kinds you've never dreamt of!!"
1139,0,Not a good translation and hard to follow. I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.
1140,0,This is the story of a great Chinese family in decline.  It is told mainly through the lives of the women and servants of the family and a boy who loved the company of the maids who surround him.  The attention to every domestic detail is delightful.  I think the story takes place in the 17th century.  I don't think it can be read in a hurry.  One needs to be alert while reading so it is not a bedtime book.
1141,0,Allow a year or so to enjoy it.  I return to it again and again.
1142,0,"You don't need me to review or opine on Robert Frost's poetry. But, let's talk about editions, Amazon's careless lumping of various books, descriptions and reviews on the same site, and what is actually in this particular book."
1143,0,"This review is being posted on the site for ""The Road Not Taken and Other Poems [Illustrated]"", which was published in 2012 by Seedbox Classics. It has a photo on the cover of a snowy track through a birch forest. It is a Kindle book. I downloaded it in 2013 as a Kindle freebie, but as of the time of the posting of this review it is available for $.99."
1144,0,"This site has an ""Editorial Review"" which is a table of poems from something called ""Poem Finder"". This is not a complete or correct table. Except for ""The Vanishing Red"", ""Snow"", ""The Road Not Taken"", ""Birches"" and maybe a few others the listed poems are not in the Seedbox Classics edition listed here.  Use the ""Look Inside"" feature to see the correct table of contents. You'll see that this version does include ""Mending Wall"", ""After Apple-picking"", and perhaps other poems that you want. (Parenthetically, (note the actual parentheses), I prefer the actual content of the book to the content listed by Poem Finder, but you might not.)"
1145,0,"This book read well on my Kindle Touch. It was for the most part properly formatted and presented. Such typographic oddities as presented themselves did not effect readability. The ""illustrations"" are just a few thumbnail photos at the end. There is an active Table of Contents and an active Index, which are both bonuses."
1146,0,"So, this is a fine selection, it works well as a Kindle book, it offers great value, and it was a happy purchase. Just be careful about what it is you're buying in order to avoid disappointment."
1147,0,"I am so enjoying Robert Frost's book ""The Road Not Taken and Other Poems.  I am finding comfort in this reading.  When in school, I did not appreciate any type of poem.  Now as a Senior Citizen, I take a different view.  I suggest this to all.  Thank you."
1148,0,"I have loved all kinds of poetry most of my life, with the exception of modern free verse poetry forms.  This Dover Thrift Edtion has a number poems, both rhymed lyrics and blank-verse dialogues by Robert Frost, an American writer (1874-1963).  Even though I am not a great fan of Robert Frost and do not like some of his long blank-verse dialogue poems; nevertheless, I do like many of his poems."
1149,0,"One of his most famous poems, ""The Road Not Taken"" is the title and first poem in this collection.  The 56 page volume includes the following poetry collections of Robert Frost:  The Road Not Taken, Christmas Trees, An Old Man's Winter Night, A Patch of Old Snow, In the Home Stretch, The telephone, Meeting and Passing, Hyla Brook, The Oven bird, Bond and Free, Birches, Pea Brush, Putting in the Seed, A time to Talk, The Cow in Apple time, An Encounter, Range-Finding, The Hill Wife: (The Loneliness-Her word, House Fear, The Smile-Her Word, The Oft-Repeated Dream, The Impulse), The Bonfire, A girl's Garden, The Exposed Nest, Out, Out-, Brown's Descent or The Willy-Nilly Slide, the Gum-Gatherer, The Line-Gang, The Vanishing Red, Snow, and The sound of Trees."
1150,0,"In conclusion, if you are a fan of the poetry of Robert Frost, you will enjoy this collection."
1151,0,"Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Haiku Moments: How to read, write and enjoy haiku)"
1152,0,It contains poems
1153,0,They are works from Robert Frost
1154,0,It is a good book.
1155,0,"Frost's poems have stanzas and line indentions, form and techniques he used for meaning and effect. This Kindle version, I returned because it did have them. All the poem lines are aligned to the left and there are no stanzas, no spaces to indicate stanzas."
1156,0,One of my favorite poets of all time. I can't believe I got this for less than $3 as it has some of his best work in this book. One of the greatest of our time and a must read for any poetry or nature love!
1157,0,Very small book.  Nice to share with someone.
1158,0,Deep and thoughtful poems on everything from old memories to the human condition.
1159,0,"Some of the poems are reminiscent of having a conversation, remembering wanting to say something and yet never saying anything only to remember you wanted to say it earlier."
1160,0,Other poems feel almost conversational about the history of relationships.
1161,0,Great poems.
1162,0,"Bought for a young child who is just beginning to study poetry, the length of the book is perfect to get a quick glimpse of Frost's work. I do wish it included Mending Wall and Stopping by the Woods, but for the price it's a great little survey of a beloved American poet."
1163,0,"As a mere admirer of poetry for the past two-and-a-half years, I have come to learn about the legends. One such being that if Robert Frost. I also grew up with Frost during both elementary and junior high schools. Granted I wasn't much interested in poetry at that time, time at least allows one to mature, and rightfully so, because I believe in order to understand poetry in its fullest and purest, you have to be mature enough to understand it. Excellent book."
1164,0,"Although the translation is atrocious, and the book is poorly redacted, it may be the most concise version ever made of this fantastic book, which should get a lot more credit in the West. Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English. Personally, some simple mistakes, repeated along the 1000 pages of the Romance, became very grating, like ""the Cao Cao's army""."
1165,0,"I can still recommend it for skilled readers, because it's the only version for Kindle at an affordable price, and it's quicker to read than other translations."
1166,0,"It may be ponderous to read, and possibly difficult to keep track of everyone, but it was an enjoyable read for me."
1167,0,After watching Red Cliff I had the desire to read more of the before and after. This book filled that desire.
1168,0,"If one want's to learn a bit more about individuals, or discern fact from fiction, the link on the kindle that takes you to Wikipedia is a useful tool."
1169,0,"This book is very long and can be hard to get through due to the overwhelming amount of characters and events going on.  As an American, there is a culture barrier for me there as well.  However I am thankful I persevered through the story.  I've always been a big Dynasty Warriors fan, and Redcliff is one of my favorite movies. It was great to get a more complete picture of the events of the Three Kingdoms, and all the little details and interactions.  A great read if you can make it through!"
1170,0,"I was introduced to the world of Romance of the Three Kingdoms thanks to the Dynasty Warriors game, and decided I wanted to read to original work that the games were based on. This is actually the second copy of the story that I've bought; the first had a drastically different translation style -- Liu Bei was Liu Pei, Guan Yu was Kuan Yu, etc -- and it was off-putting enough that I found it difficult to follow."
1171,0,"For those who are here because of the same reason I was, you'll be pleased to know that this printing shares the vast majority of the translations with the games we know and love. Sun Ce is Sun Ce, not Sun T'se!"
1172,0,"One of the problems with ordering a book on Kindle is that you don't know its full length in pages. ""The romance of three Kingdoms must be a rather thick volume and it is more a historical chronicle than a romance. For a non-Chinese the profusion of names and places make it confusing ( a map and a register of persons would have helped ). So , although it is ineresting ,it is also tiring"
1173,0,R.Simon
1174,0,"Superb, still one of the best piece of literatures. I have read it many times in other language. It is interesting to read it in English and see some variations in the interpretation of the translator. There are problems due to name pronunciations."
1175,0,"I quite like books that are long even if they are very dry, like economics books.  But this one was a bit too not good to read.  It reads like a very simple story but too many characters are thrown at you for no more than a line or two and you end up lost trying to unnecessarily remember them all."
1176,0,"Its a good story, but not very readable."
1177,0,I love the stories. I first learned about the three kingdoms playing DYNASTY WARRIORS and reading the book brought real depth and insight into the history. A great read if you can overlook some typos and bad translations.
1178,0,"The characters names get to be to much, since they are Chinese name they get to be hard to remember, but it is a great read.  The action moves right alone so name are not to much of problem."
1179,0,The Romance of Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong is an exceptional book. I recommend it to all from my heart.
1180,0,"I'm a big fan of both authors, so I was hugely disappointed with this book. It was both the characters & the ending that I did not like. Instead of finding Jordana to be an exciting, independent woman for the time period, I thought she was manipulative and self-serving in her actions, never considering the repercussions of her actions on other people. She had a singlemindedness about her that was not admirable because of the way she went about getting what she wanted, while confessing God's leading & protection. Her bullying of her older brother came off as disrespectful & mean, which was disturbing. The story of her older sister in CA drug on endlessly with both husband & wife repeating the same litany of complaints, without trusting God or each other with their burdens. I got tired of reading about them. I did enjoy & respect Jordana's brother & their new friend, Caitlyn. Adding to my dissatisfaction with the book, was getting to the end, only to find NO resolution to any of the main characters stories!"
1181,0,"Rarely do I remove a book from my device, but this one is now gone."
1182,0,"The biggest surprise in this book was that it didn't end!  Oh, there were no more pages to read . . . but none of the plot lines were resolved.  It ""ended"" in the middle.  I don't like being taken advantage of in this way and for this reason alone, I won't read any more in the series.  Normally, I love a series because I fall in love with the characters as I did with this book.  But I expect each book to also stand on its own.  This one doesn't."
1183,0,So it's done  . . . and I'm done.
1184,0,"I have read and enjoyed books by both authors, so I had high hopes for this novel.  I found this volume disappointing on many fronts.  The action took place across the US, with subjects ranging from the Civil War, the Transcontinental Railroad, Westward expansion,  and the photographic processes of the time period.  I thought the pacing was uneven, and sluggish for the most part.  The characters were fairly engaging,  but I felt that none of them were really well developed.  All seemed to have major trouble with communicating their needs and feelings.  There were multiple plot lines and NONE were fully resolved at the conclusion of this novel.  Even so, the ending felt contrived and I had a hard time believing that parents in that time period would be supportive of the choices their children made at the conclusion.  (This comment is vague intentionally so as not to be a spoiler)"
1185,0,"I felt that the authors would have served their characters (and readers )better had they chosen to focus on one set of characters at a time, and had at least one plot line reach a satisfying conclusion in each novel.  The choices they have made impel the reader to buy multiple volumes in order to have any resolution.  This strategy failed in my case, as I just don't care what happens next to any of these characters."
1186,0,Content Review:

1190,0,"Religion : prayer and trust in God mentioned often, but no strong statements of faith in Christ  or Salvation message."
1191,0,There were two major stories in this book...
1192,0,"1) Caitlan, an 18 year old Irish girl is sent away from home and a potentially nasty situation to America where her much older brother is living. A letter to Brenton and Jordana Baldwin (brother and sister, who's parents are in Russia for an extended work related stay) lets them know she will be arriving by ship soon to NYC, where they live. This was such a surprise, but they soon become fast friends, even though the difference in their social status is huge. It makes no difference to the wealthy brother and sister, but Caitlan, of the very poor working class feels the difference and will not take their offerings of lodging, so sets out to work as a chamber maid at another home. Eventually they all set off for a trek across America to find her brother in California. Now, mind you, it's during the Civil war and the three of them are 19, 16, and 18. Yikes. So that's the first story, the three young folk making their way through cities on trains with Brenton's photography gear, until there are no more rails, where at that point a wagon and horses are purchased to make their way across the plains and mountains, um, alone. Again, yikes."
1193,0,"The second story is of Caitlan's brother, Kiernan and his wife Victoria, who is Brenton and Jordana's older sister. Kiernan, a handsome charming, hard working Irish lad, lost Victoria's fortune after they married when they went to California to mine gold. They move from place to place, barely scraping by, eating meagerly, but are very much in love. Little do they know (it is the 1860’s, and it's not like they can just view an email) his sister is escaping a bad situation and headed their way. They have no idea where she is, nor how to reach her, nor when she might get there, nor where she thinks she might meet them, since she doesn't even know where they are. Yep... yikes!"
1194,0,Lots of exciting stories and events happen in both stories.
1195,0,"I think this may be my favorite Judith Pella/Tracie Peterson book so far. I'd almost given up on their books because I was becoming less and less a fan. But the writing is good, and it truly keeps your interest. Although all the talk about railroads was boring to me, it was easy to skip a few paragraphs at a time to pick back up on the story a bit later."
1196,0,"The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that this is not a full book. I may not have picked it up if I had known that, because now I don't know what happens to the three young people who have been traveling for over a year and are only about half way across the country. But it was a good book and well written, and you will want to find out what happens to the groups, which is the point isn't it?"
1197,0,"After reading a couple of completely amateur freebie Westerns, tucking into this one proved to be pure delight. It brilliantly brings to life the early days of the Civil War from the viewpoint of young New Yorkers. A highlight was the young man's struggle with complex issues of enlisting. The plot treats the reader to a look inside the home of the Vanderbilts and high New York Society and the challenges and thrills of traveling West in wartime. A less engaging subplot follows the struggles of a California miner who  fritters away his wife's fortune and the repetitive narrative of their marital woes. This was but loosely engaged to the main plot and might better have been saved for a different volume."
1198,0,"At times the writing sank toward the pedantic. Many pages are wasted with characters struggling over the same issues in their heads rather than living them in breathtaking action or clever dialog. A great editor should be all over that. Finally, the writers just seemed to pick a spot to stop writing with a small tease for the next volume of the series. If you enjoy a great ride to a breathtaking climax and a settling denouement, you'll not find it here."
1199,0,"Judith Pella and Tracie Peterson have done a wonderful job collaborating on this Christian western romance.  We are introduced to the Baldwin family and their adventures in the building of the West in connection with the transpacific railroad.  In this book we learn to love each of the members of the Baldwin family as well as their extended family.  The female protagonist that stands out for me is Jordana.  We see her emerge from an adolescent into a woman.  The authors did a superb job in her character development.  I like the way they used the literary tool of foreshadowing to building the plot line rising action.  For example, when discussing Victoria’s life (the eldest of the Baldwin siblings) in California there is references to the Donner Pass.  Needless to say, if you are a history buff you are aware of the significance of the Donner Pass and the Donner Party.  Tapping into this knowledge makes the reader curious if Victoria’s husband gets caught in this situation.  This is an excellent example of the authors’ writing skills in keeping and maintaining the reader’s interest.  In addition, the author’s end the story at the correct point as now the reader wants to read more about each of these strong and determined characters.  You can’t help but root for their success but you are left with a big question as to what happens next.  Well done."
1200,0,"An interesting read of the civil war and the conception of the railroads.  The story covers a couple in California who hunts the gold dream and ends up working for the railroad.  In love but unable to have children cause their marriage to strain, but they manage to hold on, barely."
1201,0,"There's also a brother sister duo in New York.  Benton is a photographer who is hired to take pictures of the country, cities near where the railroads will be.  Jordana is finishing school, and has a lot of spunk and actually, she is what keeps the story going.  Then there is Caitlin,  who arrives from Ireland and is supposed to go to the couple in California."
1202,0,"Great story line, just nothing is resolved in the end. Not really a cliffhanger, just a bland dead end.  Yet still worth reading if you are into the American civil war era and the railroads."
1203,0,"Volume of a trilogy written about the railroad system being built from east to west. It is centered around an expansive family full if colorful characters. There is much history interspersed throughout the book alongside enjoyable romantic musings. The story is told from two different POV’s: a young brother and sister (late teens -20) plus Irish sister-in-law from the east AND an older married couple (but still young - late 20’s/early 30’s) already in California. As the story bounces back and forth, it does so quite easily and the reader begins to see the need for additional volumes...I’m off to start #2 right now!"
1204,0,"I usually enjoy Tracie Peterson, but I struggled with continuing to read  this book.  Two characters continually repeated the same thoughts, one character was foolish, continuing to behave recklessly all the while claiming  God would protect her.  Twice I set the book aside, reading something else.  I persevered thinking I would find out what happened to at least some of the characters, but NO, it's a cliffhanger.  You have to buy the next book for ten dollars and hope you find out how it ends."
1205,0,"The book started out rather stilted and improbable, and I almost quit reading it.  But then, suddenly, it came alive and I was caught up into the edge-of-my-chair adventure along with the compelling, completely believable characters and could not put the book down.  I liked the ending, and look forward to discovering where the story goes in the next book."
1206,0,It is so good to find clean books that sweep me along on fascinating journeys.
1207,0,"I thought most of the stories were very good.  The story that I liked the most and very memorable to me because it was so funny was Smoked Butt by Brian Egeston.  The Frontiers and the Arrangment by Maurice Broddeous and Patricia Canterbury respectively were very good stories to me.  There were a couple of stories I wasn't that fond of for various reasons.  However, overall, this collection of stories is well worth reading."
1208,0,"I love this writer , he is easy to understand and keeps it interesting ."
1209,0,"There were more ""thrillers"" than ""scary"" stories in here but that DOES NOT take away from the book at all.  I must have looked up every author to write them a thank you note for contributing to this collection.  GREAT book!!!"
1210,0,This book has all kinds of horror stories from the truly twisted to the inspired lol so if you like a mix or horror then this is the book for you.
1211,0,"If you like supernatrual stories, All of the short stories were great reads. La Banks' short story made me remember how much I am going to be waiting for her books. However By reading the short stories mix, I will continue reading on? I got this book at a great price from amonzon.com"
1212,0,I read reviews that peaked my interest so I added it to my list of must read. I knew the authors and enjoyed this collection of stories.
1213,0,received the product really fast and very impressed.  would order again from the seller
1214,0,"I didn’t find this as strong as the first dark Dreams anthology, but there’s a number of stories here still worth your time. “Upstairs” by Tananarive Due is a tense and powerful closer to the anthology. Probably my favorite of the whole set."
1215,0,"“The Share” by Terence Taylor was an interesting bit of magical realism that explored the relationship between two fascinating characters whose apartments relatively overlap in time and space. “Smoked Butt” by Brian Egeston is an odd and grotesque bit of southern gothic. “Black Frontiers” by Maurice Broaddus is a nice bit of Weird West monster revenge. “The Arrangements” by Patricia E. Canterbury guideposts the situation a bit too obviously for my tastes, but the setting was excellent – I have a soft spot for small towns that harbor secrets."
1216,0,"I first heard “Wilson's Pawn & Loan” by L. R. Giles on the Nightlight podcast, and anyone who enjoys these anthologies should add Nightlight to their podcatcher. “Milez to Go” by Linda D. Addison follows the characters of “The Power” (which appeared in the first Dark Dreams and is also available to listen to at Nightlight) but in an interesting cyberpunk future. This one reminded me a lot of Shadowrun, in all the best ways."
1217,0,"""Voices from the Other Side: Dark Dreams 2"" is a brilliant collection of short horror/paranormal stories written by some of the most talented and phenomenal authors of our time. I absolutely loved each and every one for totally different reasons."

1235,0,"Now, I have several favorites but will just highlight my favorite three, and briefly explain why. Believe it or not, it was the first, one in the middle and the last. These three stand out in my mind as three of the most provocative short stories that I have read recently."
1236,0,"Eric Jerome Dickey's portrayal of Harlem was brutally honesty and powerful. I found it to be both simply written and un-expectantly wonderful. What made LA Banks' Natural Instinct brilliant was that it was from the perspective of a man, who thinks he ""can't be tame"", and his undoing is classic. And finally, Dues' upstairs, for while I would have expected her to deliver a dreaded ending, she gave us just the opposite! A child's innocence soon disappears but for reasons she doesn't understand. In conclusion, these three alone are the reason that I give this book a 5."
1237,0,"VOICES FROM THE OTHER SIDE, edited by Brandon Massey, is a collection of short stories from many authors. In Eric Jerome Dickey's ""Harlem,"" which is both scary and laugh-out-loud funny in places, an inmate in an asylum makes friends with one of his nurses and gets way too involved with her, seducing her and finally making a date with her. Brandon Massey's story, ""Deadwoods,"" involves a huge tree that suddenly pops up in the yard of an unemployed suburbanite. What can he do to get rid of this evil smelling tree that harbors something frightening among its leaves? Brian Egeston's ""Smoked Butt"" is the story of a little girl delivering food to shut-ins. She has to travel through deep woods and her adventures are awesome and screamingly funny. In ""Good 'Nough to Eat,"" Rickey Windell George, has an unemployed man seeking work wherever he can find it. Dancing in a male revue in a club is not his idea of a good job but it's all he can find. This tale has a shocking ending that will leave you gasping."
1238,0,"All the stories in the book were very good, each with its own shock value. Brandon Massey has put together a collection of stories - some funny, some horrifying - but all of them hold your interest and you find yourself wondering, as you read each one, how this particular one can possibly turn out. To the credit of the many writers, the end is always unexpected and sometimes downright zany. The writing style of Tananarive Due's ""Upstairs"" is reminiscent of Joplin's Ghost, while Terrence Taylor's ""The Share"" is heart wrenchingly realistic in a totally abnormal way. Maurice Broaddus, with his ""Black Frontiers"" brings us a taste of our lost history, along with Christopher Chambers' ""Leviathan,"" a smooth reading but frightening story about the Middle Passage. It is a book worth reading if you like looking over your shoulder or peering into dark corners."
