0,0,"Caution: Although it is listed as a different version of the same product, the $3.99 Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this.  The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book. I was able to return for a refund, but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe."
1,0,"I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for ""Journey to the West"" and ""Outlaws of the Marsh"".  I tried a different translation for ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well."
2,0,I prefer the Moss Robert's version because:
3,0,1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others)
4,0,"2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class"
5,0,3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version
6,0,"Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period."
7,0,"The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads."
8,0,"If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms."
9,0,"FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor."
10,0,"I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well."
11,0,"It's a challenging read for those of us who didn't grow up with these characters and stories, but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations, you can get completely absorbed in it. After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself."
12,0,"If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this. Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood. The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China, not so much in the rest of the world. If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book."
13,0,Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:
14,0,"""Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
15,0,Compare this with Taylor's translation:
16,0,"""Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity."""
17,0,Or Hegel's:
18,0,"""Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce."""
19,0,"It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator."
20,0,"In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire."
21,0,"It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the ""Three Kingdoms"" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together."
22,0,"For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience."
23,0,"The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map."
24,0,"The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's ""just"" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history."
25,0,"A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.)"
26,0,"Despite these caveats, ""Three Kingdoms"" is a work worthy of your time."
27,0,"Bought the digital version for a cheap price of $4. Story quality is fine, the technical aspects make it hard to read."
28,0,"It only shows one panel at a time, at low resolution. The Kindle PC app doesn't allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like 2"" in size. I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround. Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesn't help much either."
29,0,"The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment."
30,0,Pros:
31,0,- This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight.
32,0,"- Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang."
33,0,Cons:
34,0,The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves.
35,0,- There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before.
36,0,"- The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape."
37,0,***This review is based on a discovery made when attempting to start reading the book***
38,0,"The annotations & footnotes for Volume 1 are stored in the back of Volume 2. So if you care about any of these, which there are A TON, you need to buy the second book & lug it around with you. Which these books are not small or light by any means."
39,0,No where in the book itself or on this store page does it mention the appendix being in the other volume. I had to dig around online til i saw this briefly mentioned in a review for vol. 2
40,0,"Great book, although I should mention a complaint with Amazon for using bubble wrap. I couldn't return it because I was going overseas within a day, and it was simply too much hassle. The book arrived damaged, because bubble wrap doesn't protect the book. However, they have accepted my complaint, and agreed to a replacement (Thankyou!)"
41,0,"The book itself is a classic, and this is a good translation, although I want the one that starts: ""They say the momentum of history was ever thus: the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide."" That is surely one of the greatest openings in all of literature; this one isn't quite at that level. I think that version might be adapted from Moss Roberts (the same translator as this book), or it may be his earlier, abridged version."
42,0,"This is one of the four classical chinese novels, and if you are looking to connect with the Middle Kingdom and its past, this is a great (though rather heavy) place to start."
43,0,"So much has been revealed here in this book. We learn more about the prophecy, more about Thalia and her role, the Fae prophecy, and Rafe. There didn’t seem to be a whole lot of action in this book, mostly just in-law drama, and information."
44,0,"Thalia is still badass and confident as ever. I like how the author is keeping the character’s personalities consistent in each book. I’ve read series where it seems like the author struggles to maintain the same portrayal of the characters, but that isn’t any issue here. We see Thalia and her 3 mates grow and explore their relationship further. She has now claimed all 3... which basically means she has boinked with all 3 now."
45,0,Another great addition to the series and I’m eager to start the next book to find out what other drama Thalia and her 3 mates can find.
46,0,"Triad is book 3 of the TriAlpha series and the continuity issues I saw in book 2 don't seem to have bled over to this book; it's a much smoother read. There is a bit of redundancy in the words used (such as intrinsic), but I may be noticing repeats as I'm reading the books back-to-back. I like where the storyline is heading, but another annoying cliffhanger. Off to book 4..."
47,0,Blast you Serena! That ending... You know what I'm talking about. (insert stink eye) But man oh man what a ride! I love Thalia and her attitude for the crap that keeps coming her way shows how amazing she is. Her mates keep her ground which is how it should be. I seriously cannot wait for the next book. Please don't keep us waiting!
48,0,"These books just keep getting better and better. I love these characters so much. I feel mental and emotionally involved with them to a point I have to remind myself they aren't real. You just want to sit down and devour all these books because they are so amazing,"
49,0,This series just keeps getting better with each book I read in it. I love everything about it. I would definitely recommend this book.
50,0,I can’t explain how much I loved this book the more I learn the more I need to know what happens next so glad I don’t have to wait to find out
51,0,Twists and turns in plot? Check. Wonderfully complex characters? Check. A stunning world that sucks you in? Check. What more could you want?
52,0,Love this series. It’s seriously hot.
53,0,"In previous books, there was a cliffhanger of course. It's pretty typical in a series. This one though? Harsh, Serena, harsh."
54,0,"Ok so on to the actual review and less of my foot stomping. So the writing over the series has improved in flow. That or I've gotten used to it. Not sure. It has never been bad, just not the flow I prefer. So either it has changed somewhat closer to my preferred style or as I said, I've simply gotten more used to it. The dialogue has always been well done. The editing is well done, as usual. I noticed no errors in spelling, grammar or continuity."
55,0,"Thalia, as always, is a BA. In this book, she has a lot of things she must adjust to. Yet, she does so with far more grace than I probably would have. I do hope she gets her ...... back though. The guys also have some issues and some big revelations to sort through."
56,0,"Overall I would recommend this book, as well as the rest of the series."
57,0,"Why is this like crack for me? For some unknown-to-me reason, I thought this was a trilogy? Maybe the triad theme? I have no idea why. But, no! Cliffhanger-city, baby, and apparently I'm the mayor. I don't know. I really hate cliffhangers, but S. A. has been so freaking faithful about getting those books out in a timely manner that I ain't even mad. I am knuckle biting. How can this be resolved? How will the big-bad get defeated? I don't want to spoil anything here in a review, but I have all the unanswered questions. Arrrgh! There were plot twists on top of plot twists in this one."
58,0,"I'm ready for Thalia to kick all the ass in book four. I NEED her to kick all the ass. She's been through enough, and I want to see her triumph in a big way. She's an awesome heroine, and I love how she's imperfectly perfect. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next book."
59,0,"This is the first half of C. H. Brewitt-Taylor's translation of the 14th-century Chinese classic. I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Roberts's translation. While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions, as a reader I considerably prefer Roberts's translation, primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes. Lacking the information in those endnotes, I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative."
60,0,"The one respect in which I prefer the Brewitt-Taylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another. He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does, which may appeal to some readers (though not me) as suggesting the story's venerable age. The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago, and is based on historical events from about 200 A.D."
61,0,"I note that I am finding it helpful to read each chapter twice, once in each translation. The book has a vast cast of characters, none of whom I was familiar with before, but many of whom would have been known to its original audience. Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasn't trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported. (Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names.)"
62,0,I will postpone comment on the book's quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end.
63,0,"P.S. My rating of 3 out of 5 stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story, and I may well end up giving the Roberts's translation a higher rating."
64,0,"This review doesn't really concern the story - Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature, and it'd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review. It's amazing, and exciting, and definitely read it if you can."
65,0,"What I will review - and what I have significant problems with - is the Tuttle edition for Kindle. I can't really speak on the printed edition, but a lot of my criticisms, I suspect, will apply."
66,0,"Firstly, there are a ton of typos. I'm averaging one per page now. Things like:"
67,0,"""Today her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends/ and her influence is enormous."""
68,0,"It seems petty, and normally I'd ignore it, but it gets on your nerves after a while."
69,0,"The fact that there are so many of these errors speaks to a lack of proper editing, I think, which leads to my next point: a lot of the prose is pretty bad, stylistically. It varies from place to place, but it's at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment. More than once I've had to stop and ask myself: ""who is the subject of this sentence?"" or even ""who is the direct object?"" which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about."
70,0,"The register of the translation changes as well - one second a character might be speaking in a very formal, periphrastic ""bureaucratese"" and then end the sentence with something jarringly vernacular. It seems like a minor issue, but things like that can confuse characterization and are just generally poor usage. More generally, the dialogue is stilted and artificial: ""The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien Shih."" Stylistically, it's an awkward sentence - why phrase it like that? It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker - which is fine, as long as there's a strong editor to clean things up, which seems to be lacking here."
71,0,"The next one is a bit of a preference thing, I'll admit: usage of Wade-Giles. When I was learning Chinese, Pinyin was the ONLY romanization used. Say what you want about the merits of Wade-Giles, but Pinyin is what people are going to generally be familiar with today. So when I read through this and see (I think) Kongsun Tsan, I have to stop and translate it in my head: ""Kongsun Tsan? Is that Gongsun Zan?"" (I've read this book - different editions - a number of times, so I'm familiar with the characters. Otherwise I'd honestly be lost.)"
72,0,"Now I hear what you're saying: ""but what about the people that don't know anything about China? Wade-Giles would be so much simpler. That way people aren't pronouncing Cao as Cow!"""
73,0,"There are a number of other issues in the book that make that a questionable argument. Firstly, WG has its issues here as well - Kongsun's ""Kong"" is not pronounced as in King Kong. There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes, once more to do with consnant voicing, but someone utterly unfamiliar with Chinese would be tripped up by it just as well as they would with Pinyin's c equalling (roughly) [ts]. But this is a huge digression."
74,0,"For the uninitiated there are somewhat larger issues. Most notably, the usage of ranks. The book is a bit ambivalent about this: when we first meet Guangong, the book notes that this signifies he is Lord Guan (as gong = lord). Other times, however, the book introduces ranks (Chinese ranks) without a single explanation of what it is: ""so-and-so was at the time occupying the rank of ssu-tu."" Well, ok - what is this rank? Where is it on the hierarchy? Is it low or high?"
75,0,"For the record, ssu-tu is situ or ""Minister of Education."" It's worth noting that the edition didn't even get this right: ssu-tu would be si-du in Pinyin, as tu=du and t'u=tu. If you care, the apostrophe (as far as I know) here represents differentiation in consnant voicing."
76,0,"Why was it necessary to tell us this character was ""ssu-tu"" without explaining WHAT it was? (The Minister of Education, an important post, which would help explain why this person was in a position to plan a coup.) The book does this a number of times, which makes the sections revolving around court intrigue especially painful, as we're told person x had position a, person y had position b and person x had position c, with the positions generally not elaborated upon."
77,0,"The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesn't: ""Commissioner X told Y Ssu-tu [note the Chinese syntax for titles] such-and-such."" Some titles are fully translated and some aren't - so we're hearing Empress Ling tell Tung T'ai-hou (=Dowager Empress) something. It then switches. Overall, INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court."
78,0,"So we have a confused usage of ranks (some English, some Chinese, some mixed) which at times have no explanation as to what they are or where they are in the court hierarchy. At best, we've been briefed once, and it's NEVER touched again. Why couldn't the translator simply render ""ssu-tu"" as Minister of Education throughout the book? What would it have taken away that was more important than clarity?"
79,0,"This is a great work of literature, and this edition's introduction is a great transition for the Western reader into the right mindset."
80,0,My mother in law recommended this book. Its a great read to learn Chinese history from a fictional book.
81,0,I would definitely have enjoyed it more if I could follow the characters. The characters are numerous and have VERY complicated and some similar names.
82,0,This is a must for those who enjoy history. It's a Chinese classic and I've read
83,0,both books. This is reading I would recommend.
84,0,"Bought this for my son. He loves Chinese history. This book is actually historical fiction. My son says it is great. In fact, he has read it many times."
85,0,great
86,0,"I brought it for my husband, it was recommended by a friend. He loves it. He read  Clavell's Shogun and this book is similar to it."
87,0,AMAZING. From start to finish i couldn't put down these books. I recommend to anyone! Great gift for any reader
88,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
89,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
90,0,"The second part starts off with another list of characters, focussing on the aftermath of the collapse of the coalition of 18 states opposing Dong Yuan and the late Han empire. The tale starts with rural battles between bitter rivals, the emergence of Zhao Yun as a mighty warrior, and the downfall of Sun Jian in a bloody ambush. Yuck! It's interesting that our heroes - the brothers three of Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - are hardly seen in this book, other than to comment on events elsewhere while playing a chess game. Not Zhang Fei's style, to be sure. The tale of ""The Family Plot"", which dominates this book by running just over 100 pages, shows how a man sacrificed the ""honour"" of his daughter in order to restore justice through the downfall of two monstrous warriors. It's a fascinating tale that is too good to NOT be true!"
91,0,"This instalment of the tale is much gorier and sexier than the first tale, also showing the suffering peasants of China toiling under the tyranny of Dong Zhuo, who is portrayed as a bloated lech. It's pretty creepy at times too... The book ends with an essay on the nature of literary tragedy, comparing the final rivalry between Dong Yuan and Lu Bu over the love of Chan Diao with the tale of Othello. It's a decent essay on the perils of emotion and bloody rivalry."
92,0,Disclaimer: I recieved an ARC via Netgalley.
93,0,"One always worries about the second installment of anything. True, there is the Empire Strikes Back., but in many cases there is always a subtle, if not huge, let down. The second installment somehow seems weaker; it isn't bad, but just not as good as the first."
94,0," So it is with great pleasure, I can say that is NOT true of this second installment of the Legend of Three Kingdoms. The only thing wrong with this graphic novel presentation of the famed story is that you want more at the end. You go, ""What? No! Can't be over yet!""."
95,0," This, undoubtably, is a good thing for the creative and production team behind the series. It is made easier on the reader that the ending is not a cliffhanger. You just don't want the story to end."
96,0, This is better than Volume 1.
97,0," It should be noted that there is violence and sex in this book. While neither is graphic, there is no nudity or copious amounts of blood, neither is coded. There are strategically placed towels and sheets, though."
98,0," The focus of this superb installment is the plot to bring down Yhao Dung. This plot is set in place by Councilor Weng and makes use of his daughter Diao Chan, who transcends the stereotype of the sex using woman. What Diao Chan desires is far from money and fame, and has more to do with honor and survival. She is a Chinese Judith. The conversation between father and daughter, where he asks her to do the unthinkable, is beautifully drawn and written. Diao Chan is anything but a passive character and shines as a heroine who does not use a sword, but is no less heroic because of that."
99,0," The love triangle between Diao Chan Yhao Dung, and Bu Yu is starkly played out among the jockeying for power that occurs in the kingdoms. The story is told and illustrated with such pathos that it resembles a movie. The closing panels of the volume focus on this love triangle and leave the reader grasping."
100,0," The first half of the volume focuses more on battle and introducing new characters that will play larger roles later in the story. The theme that haunts the love triangle, filial and family loyalty and ties, is also present and does an excellent job of connecting the two stories."
101,0," Everything that made the first volume so good is still present - the beautiful art work, character listing, historical notes and explanation (I loved the bit about the chain scheme), as well as little extra pages depicting artwork or knowledge. These pages are placed better than they were in the ARC of the first volume."
102,0," In many ways, however, this volume would undoubtably work better in an school setting than the first. The introduction of Diao Chan will not leave female students with a focus, a female character who has strength of character and who can do what men can not. The love triangle can be used in several different ways, besides the historical context. While the book itself makes a connection to Shakespeare's Othello, a teacher can also use Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing, making Shakespeare easier or more accessible for students who couldn't care less. If the first volume has the extras that allows the reader to tie the story to modern situations, the second volume allows the reader to connect great works of literature. Additionally, the love triangle can be used to discuss questions of morality and loyalty. Furthermore, the volume (and this is true of the first as well) can be used to get students who love movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger interested in literature as well as history."
103,0," As a final word, I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It is wonderful to see this work come out in America and the publisher should be applauded for doing so."
104,0,Reason for Reading: Next in the series.
105,0,"While I thought the first volume most suited to this age group due to intellectual maturity, this second volume does become more graphic in all senses: violence, and sexuality both implied and visual.  The first book was almost a whirlwind as we got introduced to the myriad characters and intricate plot, this book does continue in that vein but also settles down into various story arcs.  Several dealing with the battles and politics but a major one in which the volume is named after ""The Family Plot"" where a plot to bring down a ruthless tyrant is put into action.  The first female character is introduced via this plot and several other characters are explored more fully.  I enjoyed this volume even more than the first one, but still do contend that it is not an easy read.  I read the book in one sitting and recommend that as the best way to read it.  Putting the book down halfway through and picking up again could prove disorienting as there really is a huge cast present here.  It is hard to keep track of everyone but as the story progresses the characters are becoming more familiar.  I could see myself re-reading this series after I'd been through it once.  I didn't mention in my first review but this is based on a Chinese epic written 600 years ago called ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms""."
106,0,"Ii agree with the previous reviewer -- this book is for more mature audiences than the first volume.  The author has again distilled a long  volume of Chinese history into a comic book of political intrigue and sexual tension.  I don't want to give away the plot. The series of books about the Three Kingdoms is the most popular book set in China.  The art conveys the action and the suspense. The words cut to the core of the story, which is what fascinated me. I'm glad somebody took the trouble to make these cultural stories available and enjoyable."
107,0,A unique gift request for a Dynasty Warriors fan.  The perfect gift!
108,0,"I first ordered the complete series.  Then I ordered season three alone due to defective discs. So now I'm sixty dollars into to it minus a six dollar compensatory partial refund.  I'm on the third replacement and still have not watched the ending of season three, disc two, sides a and b, the last episodes.  I'm trying ebay now.  Seems like Warner Brothers should be doing like a couple of other companies are doing and that is acknowledging the bad discs and offering a single disc replacement.  If not, then acknowledge these may be bad bootlegs and putting the bootlegger out of business.  How many times do I have to watch this season three disc two sides a and b carefully noting all the freezes and skips, and what they did on two or three different players.  Enough already.  When I order a dvd, I want it to play without error, and bad discs in four of four sets is not good business practice.  As for the show, I loved Kung Fu as a child, and loved seeing it again.  I just want to watch the end of The Garments of Rage and The Demon God.  But I have a feeling that in a couple of years when I go to watch the series again that none of them will play."
109,0,"Loved the series, but the current dvd sets being sent out by Amazon have uncorrectable media errors that make it impossible to view all the episodes.  I tried multiple dvd drives, multiple bluray drives, cleaning the disks, etc. all to no avail.  Episodes ""Blood of the Dragon Part Two"", ""My Brother, My Executioner"", ""The Demon God"", ""Battle Hymn"", and ""Barbary House""  in particular wouldn't play in three different sets.  Given the poor quality (full screen modified into widescreen with indiscriminate chopping of top/bottom and terrible media/recording quality) it is highly likely this batch is counterfeit."
110,0,"The third and final series of the greatest show of the '70's is coming! David Carradine unexpectedly walked out of the show at the end of this season, he's a man of many interests so he couldn't be tied down to the one show for too long. At least we have close to a hundred episodes of this tv classic as his legacy. These final episodes are:"
111,0,"1. ""Cry of the Night Beast"" (Prod #166251) October 19, 1974 - Caine hears a baby buffalo crying (supernaturally) and stops a hunter from killing its mother. But when mother and baby get separated, Caine must find a way to keep the baby alive until he can reunite them.

The catch, according to the captain, is that Caine must allow the 'beheading' of the little finger of his right hand."
115,0,"5. ""The Predators"" (Prod #166255) October 5, 1974 - Caine needs a man to return with him as a witness to the fact that he didn't kill a sheriff. But the witness is one of a gang of hunters seeking Apache scalps and an Apache, who Caine has befriended, has had a vision to kill the whole gang."
116,0,"6. ""The Vanishing Image"" (Prod #166256) December 20, 1974 - Caine seeks out a dying photographer (Lew Ayres: nominated for an Emmy for the performance) who might be able to identify Danny in a group photograph. Meanwhile, Caine is tracked down by another Chinese assassin and the old man is tracked by an Indian who believes the camera has stolen his spirit."

""Blood of the Dragon"", Part I & 2 (Prod #166257-8) September 14, 1974 - Caine shows up in Gurneyville, on the California coast, knowing (supernaturally?) that his grandfather died there the night before. As Caine tracks down what happened to his grandfather, he is being tracked by three agents of The Imperial Guards of the Dragon Throne's Order of the Avenging Dragon which needs to kill Caine to end the shame of having failed to protect the Emperor's nephew (showing that the hunt for Caine won't end with the Emperor's death in 1875*1* - though, the Dowager Empress*1* might have continued anyway)."
118,0,"8. ""The Demon God"" (Prod #166259) December 13, 1974 - In flashforwards Caine is stung by a scorpion and faces again a hallucination that he first experienced when, as a young student, he was poisoned by a Mandarin's son who wanted to learn from the temple student what awaited his dying father in the land of the dead."
119,0,"9. ""The Devil's Champion"" (Prod #166260) November 8, 1974 - In China a strange challenger shows up at the temple gates to challenge Master Kan to ritual combat to the death. Caine, who is having visions, must find out who or what is behind the situation."
120,0,"10. ""The Garments of Rage (Prod #166261) November 1, 1974 - After the events in ""The Demon God"" (#47 the last episode set in the present), Caine is left battered with his clothes torn, and he is taken in by railroad workers. The railroad is being harassed by a Shaolin master who has also fled China. This former teacher offers Caine clothes that had belonged to his nephew who died in a railroad accident. (At first Caine refuses to wear the clothes which might symbolize that he would help sabotage the railroad, but later Caine accepts the clothes and wears them for the rest of the series)."

124,0,"14. ""One Step to Darkness"" (Prod #166265) January 25, 1975 - Caine comes to the rescue of a woman and for his trouble is arrested by her army officer husband. The woman turns out to be addicted to a Chinese drug (opium?) and she introduces Caine to a mystical world where he meets a demon who claims the priest's life for a wish the very young Caine had made while sick with typhoid."
125,0,"15. ""The Thief of Chendo"" (Prod #166266) March 29, 1975 - Master Po and the young Caine visualize what it will be like when Caine leaves the temple. The two imagine (?) in a 'flashforward' (?) that Caine, now a priest, has been sent to help a duke.

126,0,"16. ""Battle Hymn"" (#166267) February 8, 1975 - While chasing Caine for the reward, a man falls from his horse and is killed. The useless death leads Caine to shaving his head.

""The Last Raid"" (Prod # 166271) April 26, 1975 - On his way to Lordsville to answer a summons from Serenity Johnson (which he does in the following episode ""Ambush"" even though it seems ""Ambush"" was originally broadcast first), Caine visits old friends from ""The Well"" just as their son is kidnapped by former Confederate raiders who continue to fight the Civil War."
129,0,"19. ""Ambush"" (Prod #166272) April 4, 1975 - Serenity Johnson from ""Dark Angel"" & ""The Nature of Evil"" sends for Caine and then lies about how sick he is to get the priest to help him claim a $2000 debt.

130,0,"20. ""Barbary House"" (Prod #166269) February 15, 1975 - The poster from #58 ""Ambush"" leads Caine to an establishment outside San Francisco. Danny has left but the owner is holding Danny's son, Zeke, and Caine is forced to become a prize fighter to stay with his nephew. (This is the first of a four part story line.)"
131,0,"21. ""Flight to Orion"" (Prod #166270) February 22, 1975 - Caine, Zeke and Zeke's mother try to find Danny before the search party which plans to find/kill him for a $10,000 reward (strange how both brothers turn out to have the same price on their heads)."
132,0,"22. ""The Brothers Caine"" (Prod #166273) March 1, 1975 - Zeke sells himself to his grandfather so that he can acquire information to help Kwai Chang find and warn Danny. Meanwhile, Danny is told that Kwai Chang is an assassin hired to kill him."

134,0,Enjoy!
135,0,"The first season was good, the second was great, and the third and final season made the show a legend."
136,0,"If you start at the beginning of this season, and I know you will, you'll be disappointed for a few episodes.  They had to get their groove back or something.  And then, with no gradual transition whatsoever, the writing will leap into the stratosphere and remind you why you love this show.  It is simply awesome, and it isn't dated."
137,0,"One thing they did at the start of this season was try to raise the level of menace on the martial arts, but it was already there."
138,0,"At times, the verbal sparring was even better than the kung fu, and you know how great that was."
139,0,"I've written before that you should use superlatives sparingly, and one memorable essay mentioned car horns in China.  I could have instead mentioned Kwai Chang Caine's gold silks.  When he puts those on, it's clobberin time!"
140,0,"In my review of the second season, I realized that I'd never seen Caine eat with chopsticks.  And just to remain so petty, he does it here, and he eats just fine.  Hey, I lived in China for 6 years.  I notice these things."
141,0,"When I ordered these DVDs, I envisioned using them in my class, encouraging my students to point out the inaccuracies because they'd be hyper-motivated to do so.  In English, which is what I was teaching.  But the timing was a little off, as I quit teaching that class a few weeks before I got these DVDs."
142,0,"Oh well.  Looking over it myself, the inaccuracies are minor.  Master Kan should in fact be called Master Chen, for example.  But the big details, which are why we love this show and why it's timeless, are absolutely spot on.  KUNG FU remains a rare classic that, to the best of my knowledge, American TV hasn't equaled and probably never will."
143,0,"I really enjoyed this series when it was first aired in the 70s. I'm not much of a fan of either old westerns or martial arts, but this genre-bender series is a rare exception, as it puts a Kung Fu expert and Shaolin Priest up against the bad guys in the American old west. Not your typical western series, by a long shot. Caine is a very unique hero, one that opposes senseless killing and violence, but has the superior ability to defend himself and others against criminal violations and wrongful injustice like no other. Like Richard Kimble of ""The Fugitive"" series, he is also forever moving from town to town, avoiding the law because he is wanted by the Chinese government for murder of the emperor's nephew (who murdered his blind master), and also in search of his half-brother Danny Caine."
144,0,"In this season, there are also a few episodes that take place in China, flashing back to a time before Caine fled to America. One is about a conflict that the temple had with an evil Mandarin, another about a warlord that threatens to destroy the temple unless it surrenders a woman seeking sanctuary, and another about Caine's problems after he killed the emperor's nephew (for killing his blind Master Po)."
145,0,"  I couldn't resist purchasing both seasons 2 & 3 of this series when it was on sale, and I am relieved to report that, even though the dvds are double-sided, I have not had any problems with them. It may be that the quality is better than many other double-sided dvds because, rather than squeeze 4 hour-long episodes on one side, this dvd collection has only 3 episodes per side. Less compression could make all the difference with the digital quality. Either that or I was lucky and got a really good set."
146,0,"If you grew up in the 70's, then you may remember this t.v. show which aired at that time. I was only 11yrs. old then and can vividly recall just how much of an impact this show had on me back then, just as much as it has helped to shape some of my philosophies in this present day."
147,0,"Granted, by today's standards, the show may be slow paced and at times presents some seemingly awkward dialog."
148,0,"But if one has the patience and willingness (traits that are also illustrated example lessons brought up for consideration as part of the storylines) to slow down and really 'absorb'  what is trying to be said... the main character's situation as a stranger in a foriegn land...wanted (regretfully but unjustly, also a matter of perspective) for murder... despised and looked down upon because of the ignorance of those who do not understand his race and culture and yet he posseses a physical discipline and spiritual wisdom to deal with how and why these things are all part of the human condition, you'll find the character of Kwai Chang Caine a very inspiring and unique individual."
149,0,"Pretty deep stuff for an 11 yr. old (or for that matter, American television back then)."
150,0,Great life lessons are a part of the benefit of this show.
151,0,"As much as I loved Kung Fu, it would be great to see a tv show today which (perhaps in an updated sophisticated setting that younger people can relate to, although I do have a hard time endeavoring to be tolerant with some of today's moral standards) would present some of the thought provoking scenarios that were prevalent in alot of the episodes in this series."
152,0,I bought this with low expectations. My experience had been the same as another reviewer: I loved the first 2 seasons back in the seventies when they first came out. In fact the show had a profound effect on shaping my life. But I was eventually turned off by the mysticism of the 3rd season and stopped watching.
153,0,But now that I've watched the entire 3rd season on DVD I see that my giving up on the show was premature. There are treasures here. Some of these episodes do indeed rank right up there with the gems of the first 2 seasons. I particularly enjoyed the four-part ending (follow the episode-order given by another reviewer so as to watch these four last and see Caine's final bow at the end.)
154,0,"There are indeed mystical aspects in several of the episodes which do detract from the integrity of the show. (We're not talking about spirituality here: we're talking about the physically impossible and downright ludicrous.) But don't let that put you off, because there are still plenty of other episodes that do not suffer from this flaw."
155,0,"If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons you won't want to miss the 3rd. It's not as good as the first 2 seasons, but it is till better than almost any dramatic series on TV since."
156,0,"The extras are also good. I felt a real warmth from David Carradine as he reminisced about the show, and the trip to China captured the sense of camaraderie amongst the travelers."
157,0,"In the third season, Caine meets up with many of his relations. I created a family-tree chart to help keep track of them, and added this to the ""customer images"" in the product photo gallery, above."
158,0,"This season has a great many wonderful episodes, a few stinkers, and as other reviewers here have often lamented, an unfortunate tendency to delve into mysticism and the occult resulting in an embarrassing loss of realism and dramatic ""quality"" on occasion. In addition, four episodes, (five actually; one is a two-part episode) take place entirely in China and, other than providing some colorful insights into Kwai Chang's temple years, are wholly unrelated to Caine's ongoing western adventure. Though I generally enjoyed these China episodes I could have just as easily done without them being tossed into the middle of the ""western experience"" as they were. They generally do not flow with the unique ""moral dynamic"" established in the first two seasons: i.e. Caine's  ""temple reflections"" brilliantly  juxtapositioned against the violence of the American west."
159,0,"This dynamic was so utterly well conceived by Spielman and Miller it's lamentable that the third season so often strays away from it. The original concept of Caine in America with the philosophy weighted ""flashbacks"" to his past broke completely new ground and made the series what is was. Thus, the ""continuity"" that fans had come to expect from episode to episode (Caine sauntering off into the wilds at the end of an episode and then walking back into civilization in the next) suffers greatly when one suddenly is thrown back to China for episodes that have little to do with or add many insights into Caine himself or his western adventures."
160,0,"That said, die-hard fans of this series should heartily enjoy the third season but much more if THE EPISODES ARE WATCHED IN ORDER OF THEIR PRODUCTION SEQUENCE , not broadcast date.  What's the issue here? Like Seasons 1 and 2 Warner has released Season 3 with the discs arranged in order of broadcast date. Makes sense right? Wrong. The problem is that the NETWORK (ABC) appears to have originally broadcast many of the episodes completely out of sequence from the order that the production company delivered them and presumably intend them to be broadcast in.  How do we know this? Look at seasons 1 and 2. They were broadcast (and subsequently released by Warner on DVD) in the exact production sequence in which the episodes were made.  Because of this their episode ""continuity"" is perfectly intact. But was this the intention of the production company during season three? Taking a closer look, it soon becomes evident it may have very well been their intention. For when watching the season in broadcast sequence,  the order in which the Warner discs are arranged,  many nagging incongruities appear:"
161,0,For instance:
162,0,"The episode ""Full Circle"" was clearly intended to end the season, as the three episodes leading up it make clear.  Caine and his brother are reunited. But the network broadcast an addition three episodes AFTER this (one a ""China"" episode) where Caine has apparently again lost touch with him. The Warner release repeats this incongruity."
163,0,"In the opening of ""The Garments of Rage"",  Caine's  well  worn yellow shirt has been completely destroyed (in some mysterious accident) and he ends the episode in all new garb (the renegade Shaolin priests nephews black and white silk clothes).  However when he next appears in the west (after the two-part ""Besieged"", set in China) he appears in the episodes ""The Demon God"" and ""The Vanishing Image"" with the yellow shirt again. In the following episode ""A Lamb to the Slaughter"" he is inextricably wearing the new garb acquired in ""The Garments of Rage"" again."
164,0,"There are several other examples but to cut to the chase, if the PRODUCTION SEQUENCE is adhered to, these flaws dissappear and the episodes flow seamlessly:"
165,0,"""Full Circle"" ends the series as intended. The ""mysterious accident"" which has apparently occurred prior to the opening of ""The Garments of Rage"" is now explained by the events of the preceding episode ""The Demon God"".  When Caine next appears in the west he is properly clothed in the new garments he acquired at the end of ""The Garments of Rage"", as it should be. And ""The Vanishing Image"" happens before all of these while Caine still has his yellow shirt intact, etc."
166,0,"Just how the network and Warner missed the importance of broadcasting or releasing these episodes on DVD in the right sequence is puzzling, but the remedy for purchasers of season three is simple. Just watch them in the order listed below and the season's originally intended continuity will be preserved. In fact, if one wishes to bypass the all the episodes that are set completely in China, marked by an ""(All in China)"" note, you can enjoy the unbroken saga of Caine's ""western"" adventure without the interruption the stand alone China episodes which have little to add to Kwai Chang's American sojourn and his continued search for his brother. Afterwards they can serve as a nice group of ""Special Feature"" episodes to watch!"
167,0,"(We'd like to thank [...] for turning us on to this list. We have used their suggestion of placing  ""The Vanishing Image"" after ""Blood of the Dragon"" as it is clear the production team meant for the arrival of yet another member of ""The Avenging Dragons"" society to follow ""Blood of the Dragon"" not precede it.)"

194,0,"That the network may have intentionally broadcast certain episodes out of sequence because of ""ratings"" wars during the third season's run is certainly not without precedent. Whether the above list is the ""quintessential"" order in which these episodes were meant to air by the series producers is of course uncertain. But if the production sequence is generally adhered to (as strictly done in seasons 1 and 2) there are little to no continuity problems with story lines, costumes, or David Carradine's slowly lengthening hair for that matter."
195,0,"Finally, as recommended above, if one wishes to bypass the episodes set completely in China and sets them aside for another time, the continuity of the Caine's western saga, and an experience more akin the formula and magic of the first two seasons can be more easily retained."
196,0,-Ed Truthan
197,0,"The episodes following the ones pertaining to the discovery of Caines brother are filler. By season three, they seemed to be not taking their time with production detail. The pacing of the episodes in the first two seasons were wonderful to behold ( especially compared to TV  produced today for the ADD crowd ). I feel Caradine had fully explored his character by the end of season three and can understand his moving on. Story lines not as solid in third year as first two seasons ( except for those involving finding his brother ). Definitely worth purchasing, but cannot compare to excellence of first two seasons."
198,0,Classic.  Profound.  Masterpiece.  Campy.  Wonderful.
199,0,"I can't say I'm well versed in the many different translations of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as this is the first time I'm reading the story. However, despite how old the narrative is, I find it interesting with a lot of politics and the prominent characters always looking to maneuver with and against each other. As unexpected events come up with stability in the land always teetering on the edge, alliances and rivalries can also take drastic turns. I sometimes do have to check back on the character list because of the sheer number of named characters that show up in the story, but it's not hard to follow overall."
200,0,"This is a wonderful historical novel of the three Kingdom period (end of the Han Empire) in Chinese history.  Among many things I liked about the book, is that it detailed not only individual actions (fighting) of key figures but also went into the rationale of their planning and strategy  --  and since many characters are mentioned in the story not all of the strategy had a good ending.  I especially liked they way the story ended each chapter, section with a prelude to what would happen next.  Perhaps this is due to the way the story was originally written  almost serialized.  I found the story relatively easy to read and hard to put down.  If the reader is unfamiliar with Chinese geography,following along on a map might be useful, but then this might not be needed as one could just flow with the story.  I have not read any other translations of this classic so I cannot compare to  other translations.  But I did enjoy this one and will start Vol 2 shortly  I highly recommend this story.  The ebook version was very good and the footnotes were easy to access."
201,0,If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series. This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter. There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions. The names and places are spelled/pronounced more accurately. This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.
202,0,Best translation that I have of the series. I have 4 different ones. Very happy with this book.
203,0,"As a teacher for many years I was pleased to find so many literary treasures in Three Kingdoms. A basis of the story is the chance meeting together of the three heroes Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. This happening reminds me that we come onto many good things in life by chance rather than plan. They made a sacred oath of brotherhood. Their loyalty to one another was a joy to read. Their loyalty was tested many times but it endured even in times of great challenge. Their personalities were all quite different from one another however those differences became the strength of their joining together. We all enjoy being individuals and treated as individuals but we all end up belonging to a group whether it is a formal group of some kind or a social alliance."
204,0,"I enjoyed reading about Cao Cao, the nemesis of the three heroes. Cao Cao is a powerful and cunning military leader. We learn that he had his own weaknesses and doubts. The question came to mind many times; what does one do when one has doubts and is afraid of making the wrong choice? He does what we all usually do; we seek out a friend with whom to discuss the situation. We are looking for clarity and some good advice. This is exactly what Cao Cao did and it worked to his advantage."
205,0,"Three Kingdoms opened my eyes to give me better insight into events all around me.  Perhaps the most significant episode, for me, was how Cao Cao met the challenge of Yuan Shao. Cao Cao was vastly outnumbered in the confrontation ahead. Two large armies of hundreds of thousands led by Cao Cao and Yuan Shao compete for domination of the empire. The episode in Chapter 18 is so well written that I can feel the trepidation and uncertainty that Cao Cao feels at the moment.  At this movement of Cao Cao's crisis his senior Advisor Guo Jia, comes to him to relieve him of his doubts. This explanation Guo Jia is one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  After the talk together Cao Cao's confidence is restored and he goes on to defeat Yuan Shao's army which is five times the size of is own, WOW!  There are many episodes in Three Kingdoms that stir my understanding and give me hope.  It is a welcome edition to my library."
206,0,"I have been wanting this book for a VERY long time, but never had the means to buy it when I was 10. I haven't finished the book yet, but it's a pretty good translation. The only other version I could find was the abridged version. I really like that I get to finally enjoy this book after some 10-11 years."
207,0,So happy to have them
208,0,"This new translation of the Chinese classic Three Kingdoms was awesome to read. It explained how a dedicated group of people could coalesce around an idea with the hopes of having it come true. Liu Bei was definitely an inspired leader. The people who formed his core leadership group each had outstanding traits. I understand better now how an inspired idea can collect followers to try to achieve worthy goals. I also understand better now the importance of wise advice by seeing the impact Zhuge Liang has on events. He thoughtfully considered the details of a situation and then explained to Liu Bei, his leader, how to wisely respond to it in order to achieve worthy results. But without the skillful help of Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun achieving these goals would be impossible. So. It takes three components to achieve success: the worthy idea, good strategy and skillful implementation."
209,0,"  Liu Bei has many challenges to overcome, but this combination of a goal directed idea and good strategy for implementation are the critical components for success. It is rewarding to read how people with helpful aspirations can achieve success through loyalty and dedicated efforts. Though I have only read vol. 1, and part of vol.2,  I am eager to finish reading volumes 2 and 3 to discover how all these events end."
210,0,"  I found the Chinese names to be confusing to follow, but the glossary of main characters listed in the front of the book provided easily found information to help me through the reading of this exciting story."
211,0,"  The innovative use of poetic little poems injected at critical points in the text were unusual but quite pleasing. The author of this book and its translators, Iverson and Yu Sumei, did a fine job producing an awesome book."
212,0,Really excellent translation
213,0,"The necklace and earrings are GORGEOUS!!  They sparke and shine bright, it looks better than the pictures!!  I have not worn them yet so hopefully it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin but they look absolutely beautiful!!"
214,0,"It is so pretty especially the earrings. My ears are really sensitive. So usually I don’t wear any earrings , but this time I tried and my ears were fine. It made me feel so happy"
215,0,Bought it as a gift for my moms birthday. She absolutely loved it. It’s not exaggerated big and the earrings are perfect size. The set is bright and shiny
216,0,Bought as a gift. My mother loved it and said it was beautiful and good quality.
217,0,Everything about this set is perfect!!! The beauty is breath taking...the colors are unbelievable....I  purchased the blue purple color...the adjustable chain make it so versatile in wearing with different neckline and collars...it brought tears to my wife's eyes when she opened the box....every time she wears it she gets all kinds of compliments...
218,0,"Chose the blue crystal set for a gift.  Received well.  The pendant is quite striking, even prettier than in the pictures.  The round inset near the top of the crystal seems smaller than in the photos but adds nicely to the overall effect.  Also, the reverse side of the pendant is very different from the front but is also very pretty: it can be worn as well.  Well worth the price!"
219,0,"I purchased this necklace and earrings at the last minute to go with a beautiful formal gown that I had purchased to go to a New Year's Eve celebration.  It arrived the next day (December 30), and was a beautiful compliment to my gown.  I love it!"
220,0,I absolutely love this product! My husband bought it for me as a surprise and it blew me away! I cried. It’s so lightweight and not heavy at all. I love it
221,0,Really nice gift to my gf.. my gf is so happy
222,0,"My wife was ore than happy! We just returned from HA and I should have pulled the trigger there on a multi-colored Sea Turtle Necklace I had seen! She always wanted a Swarovski piece as they are attractive plus, this set makes the right statement. I cannot speak yet to the longevity but if I have or she has any issues..."
223,0,"Although the translation is atrocious, and the book is poorly redacted, it may be the most concise version ever made of this fantastic book, which should get a lot more credit in the West. Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English. Personally, some simple mistakes, repeated along the 1000 pages of the Romance, became very grating, like ""the Cao Cao's army""."
224,0,"I can still recommend it for skilled readers, because it's the only version for Kindle at an affordable price, and it's quicker to read than other translations."
225,0,"It may be ponderous to read, and possibly difficult to keep track of everyone, but it was an enjoyable read for me."
226,0,After watching Red Cliff I had the desire to read more of the before and after. This book filled that desire.
227,0,"If one want's to learn a bit more about individuals, or discern fact from fiction, the link on the kindle that takes you to Wikipedia is a useful tool."
228,0,"This book is very long and can be hard to get through due to the overwhelming amount of characters and events going on.  As an American, there is a culture barrier for me there as well.  However I am thankful I persevered through the story.  I've always been a big Dynasty Warriors fan, and Redcliff is one of my favorite movies. It was great to get a more complete picture of the events of the Three Kingdoms, and all the little details and interactions.  A great read if you can make it through!"
229,0,"I was introduced to the world of Romance of the Three Kingdoms thanks to the Dynasty Warriors game, and decided I wanted to read to original work that the games were based on. This is actually the second copy of the story that I've bought; the first had a drastically different translation style -- Liu Bei was Liu Pei, Guan Yu was Kuan Yu, etc -- and it was off-putting enough that I found it difficult to follow."
230,0,"For those who are here because of the same reason I was, you'll be pleased to know that this printing shares the vast majority of the translations with the games we know and love. Sun Ce is Sun Ce, not Sun T'se!"
231,0,"One of the problems with ordering a book on Kindle is that you don't know its full length in pages. ""The romance of three Kingdoms must be a rather thick volume and it is more a historical chronicle than a romance. For a non-Chinese the profusion of names and places make it confusing ( a map and a register of persons would have helped ). So , although it is ineresting ,it is also tiring"
232,0,R.Simon
233,0,"Superb, still one of the best piece of literatures. I have read it many times in other language. It is interesting to read it in English and see some variations in the interpretation of the translator. There are problems due to name pronunciations."
234,0,"I quite like books that are long even if they are very dry, like economics books.  But this one was a bit too not good to read.  It reads like a very simple story but too many characters are thrown at you for no more than a line or two and you end up lost trying to unnecessarily remember them all."
235,0,"Its a good story, but not very readable."
236,0,I love the stories. I first learned about the three kingdoms playing DYNASTY WARRIORS and reading the book brought real depth and insight into the history. A great read if you can overlook some typos and bad translations.
237,0,"The characters names get to be to much, since they are Chinese name they get to be hard to remember, but it is a great read.  The action moves right alone so name are not to much of problem."
238,0,The Romance of Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong is an exceptional book. I recommend it to all from my heart.
239,0,"In THE BATTLE OF CHIBI, Hock G. Tjoa has translated the pivotal section of THE ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS, and provided readers with an accessible, accurate and stirring glimpse into that brutal world."
240,0,"The action here, as in the entire book, concerns the deeds of three great heroes, a great sage-strategist, a classic villain and many others who are somewhere in between. All live in a time when the world is in constantly at war. There is not a moment when plots are not being hatched, cabals and alliances made and undermined, battles fought, murders planned, ways to seize power calculated."
241,0,"The pursuit of dominance distorts all traditional values and shapes the psychology, virtuous or otherwise, of every single person in the book. Hock is faithful in conveying the devastating impact of this great classic in which no amount of goodness, wisdom, elegance, guile, or valor can enable one to escape from endless and unrelenting violence."
242,0,"The Battle of Chibi is a modern translation of selections (310 pages) of the classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms, described by historian Francis Fukuyama in his epic Origins of Political Order.  Fukuyama writes that Romance is ""one of the greatest Chinese historical novels . . . The significance of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms in shaping the historical consciousness of modern Chinese has been compared to that of the historical plays of Shakespeare, and the novel has been turned into video games and countless movies"" (Fukuyama 2011, 144-5).  This translation by Hock Tjoa is dramatic and well worth reading!"
243,0,Great telling of a great battle. Simply written and looks great on my note 3
244,0,"I would describe The Battle of Chibi as an epic novel of war, but also there was a lot of romance and poetry in the story. It did take a little time for me to get into the book. Reading the e-book version, there was a huge amount of preamble and explanation as well as a guide for how to read the book before I could actually get to the actual book. And then once you start reading, there are huge number of names to keep track of.  It was a little daunting."
245,0,"Ultimately however, it's an incredibly compelling story about a battle between three kingdoms led respectively by Bei, Cao, and Quan.  Although there are many characters, you do get to know very well about seven or so characters and become very attached and want to know more about their story. It starts to pick up a lot before about page 100, and by about the halfway point, I could not stop reading!"
246,0,"I love books where I actually can learn something by reading it, and this is a great example. I love learning the Chinese ancient culture. I thought this was very well translated and I love the language of it.  The descriptions were poetic and beautiful."
247,0,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.  It does take some time to get into, but it is well worth it!"
248,0,"What makes ""The Battle of Chibi,"" a 300 pager,such a worthwhile read  is a feeling of global impact. Here is a mythos/history of ancient China worth absorbing. The world view of the most populous nation on earth and one that retains much of its ancient heritage should interest us, yet Western readers know little of its evolution. In this fascinating novel, which is part history, part fiction, part drama, and part poetry, Hock G. Tjoa ably takes on the mantle of translator and literary interpreter for  a battle along a river that determined four hundred years of  ancient Chinese history."
249,0,"Tjoa does an excellent job at meeting his goal of providing the original in a more  ""readable and lively language as well as internal consistency.""  It's a worthwhile though not an easy read. As a boy in the book says, ""I cannot remember all the names."""
250,0,"At the outset, the author provides useful background. The historical events were originally recounted in a classic Ming novel, ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms,"" written in 1400 by Luo Guanzhong.  In turn the ""Romance"" was a compilation of work by  writers living in the third and fourth centuries AD. (The Arthurian legend immediately comes to mind.)  Luo's  version is in four volumes of 120 scenes/chapters,  the first 80 of which is about the decline of the Han Dynasty and the rise of three kingdoms,  a period of transition from 184 to 280 AD. Tjoa characterizes the divergence  as one  ""between imperial unity and fragmentation."""
251,0,"The selections chosen from the ""Romance"" center on the Battle of Chibi (Red Cliffs), dated 208AD, which Tjoa points out was ""the tipping point"" between the Han and Three Kingdoms periods. One of the three realms, the Shu,  was  led by Han loyalist Liu Bei. A second,  the Wei,  was led by Cao Cao the Usurper. Cao's plan was to become the new unifier of China, but his ambitions disqualified him in the eyes of the other two leaders.  A third realm, the Wu led by Sun Quan, lay on the fringe of what was called All under Heaven, a name, says Tjoa, that equates to a Greco-Roman term, ""the whole known civiilized world.""  An interesting pattern emerges in the novel's three-part structure.  To my eye, a dialectic of  thesis, antithesis, and synthesis  unifies the diversity of the  structural components as well as underlining the clash of cultures. The dynasty's decline is vividly characterized by its eunuchs,  warlords, and rebels."
252,0,"I became engaged in the story also through the spare, dramatically staged dialogue and the pleasing literary elements. The title of  Chapter 8 (""Like Fish Seeking Water"") is one  example of how metaphor and poetry are used to illustrate what is going on. Here's another: ""Screens, decorated with feathers,/Divide the space inside/Bamboo fences and fragrant flowers/Define the space outside."""
253,0,"A new world order emerges from the divisiveness, and though the country is no longer unified, neither is it so insularly focused.  At the end of the day, Tjoa's work is historical romance  in the most classic sense of the term. It would certainly lend itself to screen adaptation."
254,0,"Anne Carlisle, Ph. D., reviewer and author of ""Home Schooling: The Fire Night Ball"""
255,0,This is the second book by Hock Tjoa that I have read.
256,0,"The Battle of Chibi is the translation of the well-known Chinese epic The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It starts at the end of the Han Dynasty, 169 A.D. The whole time period is represented in a fascinating way that is made understandable to lay people. In this translation, the insight into the world and thoughts of the Chinese during this time period is accessible and easy(ish) to read. The power struggle between the warlords and the intrigue between those striving for power is really human nature and has never been any different. What I find fascinating is the sizes of the armies which must correlate with the size of the population at the time. This is a great introduction to the ancient Chinese culture and this is a must-read for anyone interested in this."
257,0,"I love that this book is so welcoming to those of us with limited knowledge of Chinese history -- the ""Note About Reading This Book"" that starts the book is a graceful, opening door that draws all readers in, and I thought that was well done."
258,0,"Of course, that would be wasted if the rest of the book weren't top-notch -- but The Battle of Chibi is excellent and reads like the very best combination of old world fairy tales and historical adventure stories. Anyone who remembers reading a Brothers Grimm collection knows that those tales were not the fluff conjured by the worlds ""fairy tale"" -- they were searing adventure stories and moralistic fables told in language that got straight to the action. The Battle of Chibi does the same, planting the reader firmly in the story but creating a sense of formal otherworldliness with careful use of words and pacing."
259,0,"In places, the different pieces of the work read almost like a screenplay, with conversational back-and-forth introduced with a name and a colon. In another work this might bother me, but it fit here. We are seeing action as it unfolds, and the quick exposition helped me feel the urgency."
260,0,I would recommend this work to any student of history -- Chinese or not -- but also to anyone who loves a good tactical fairy tale (I assuire you there is such a thing). Hock Tjoa brings history to life in The Battle of Chibi.
261,0,"It took me a bit to get into it, it felt a bit like when I read an ancient piece of Greek literature that has been translated... it just didn't flow for me right out of the gate. Once I was able to get the characters squared away and into the flow of the story, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it. I particularly enjoyed the intrigue and strategies employed by the different parties in the story and then I have to remind myself that this isn't entirely fiction, the battle of Chibi really took place."
262,0,"I admit that prior to reading this, I knew very little about Chinese history or culture beyond the last 50 years or so. This has definitely piqued my interest and I hope to find more about the great nation of China and how it came to become what it is."
263,0,This was a First-Reads selection from Goodreads
264,0,"The Battle of Chibi may appear at first to be a daunting read, but it is well worth the effort.  The book offers an abridged version of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  For those who are not acquainted with this revered saga, The Battle of Chibi is an excellent introduction."
265,0,"The introductory sections of the book are extremely helpful to readers who are unfamiliar with the story or the culture.  The reading advice presented here is excellent and helps to make the entire book more accessible.  The Battle of Chibi is well written, presenting not only the actions of warriors but insight into the culture and thoughts of those involved."
266,0,"This is not just a story of war.  It is a tale of honor, betrayal, strategy, heroism, love and sacrifice.  The characters are shrouded in legend and myth, but they are still intrinsically human."
267,0,"Readers who are not accustomed to this type of literature may have difficulty at first with making sense of the seemingly unending battles, beheadings, plots and characters.  In the end, persistence pays off.  The story unfolds and primary figures emerge.  To me, the story became intriguing when master strategists matched wits.  Those who enjoy tales of schemes within plots veiled in subterfuge will love this book."
268,0,A complimentary copy of this book was received in exchange for a non-reciprocal review.
269,0,"Other reviewers have discussed the plot of  ""The Battle of Chibi"" so I won't reiterate it here. There is a long introduction which references the context of the original work, translations of some terms and even suggestions on how to read the book.  This probably works better in paperback than for an e-book (I don't tend to flick back and forth when reading on Kindle) and I found myself skimming it, eager to start reading the thing itself. It was something I came back to at the end."
270,0,"Likewise, there is a translator's preamble before each part. I can see why this is necessary - the translator does not want to misrepresent the original and so needs to tell us what he omitted - nevertheless, again, I found myself coming back to it later. When the book finally started - ""This is the nature of the history of All under Heaven (China): when the empire is divided for long, it unites; when united for long, it falls apart"" - I was hooked immediately."
271,0,"The first part is the most challenging. It's not the kind of book you can (should?) read once. I did get confused between the names at times but that was just unfamiliarity. It is like reading the Iliad or Dante's 'Divine Comedy' and so needs to be read and re-read. Like those, it is also full of violence and complex plots and some beautiful visual imagery. The art historian in me longs to see this in hardback with lavish illustrations."
272,0,"I'm not qualified to comment on the accuracy of Tjoa's translation but the result is extremely readable with no affectations and a great flow, especially once the pace picks up in the second and third parts. The dialogue was also an easy read. There is a lot about strategy in the book (it is the history of a battle after all) but also about the nature of power and the way it corrupts and motivates individuals. A fascinating read that brought an epic to my attention."
273,0,"At $1.99, with enabled table of contents, excellent value. There are no notes nor explanatory matter. If the great number of characters is confusing you can find maps, relationship charts, and other resources at the 3Kingdoms Podcast site."
274,0,Great story. Well made book. Fast shipping. The print is tiny to the point of being too hard for these old eyes to read. Invest the extra money for a legible print size
275,0,Excellent book about the Romance warring era. Just wish the print was a little bigger. Tons of characters to keep track of too.
276,0,This edition of the Chinese classic has print that's unreadably tiny.  The print margins are nearly non-existent and the print's uneven on the pages.  I had to send it back.
277,0,good read
278,0,What else can I say?
279,0,"One word ""Epic"""
280,0,Print size so small it gave me a headache. I'm talking pocket bible size font...beware.
281,0,Exactly what i expected and arrived early.
282,0,A lot of life lessons can be learned with an open mind.
283,0,"Volume eight is a very unusual tale, in that it follows the sworn three brothers throughout nearly all of the tale as they bring the war to Cao Cao, but it also shows Cao Cao as a loving father who horses around with elephants and shows compassion to his enemies."
284,0,"The tale starts off with the fate of Yuan Shao, who was doomed to die a stupid death after mishandling his position as the only warlord in China in a position to challenge Cao Cao, who philosophises at his enemy's grave (later, a contrasting scene at Guo Jia's grave shows Cao Cao mourning the loss of a man he truly could trust). Yuan Shao's tale is ultimately not very interesting, as he suffers the fate of so many ill-fated warlords through Three Kingdoms (and through all of Chinese history), but you do get a sense that the characters in Three Kingdoms are consolidating and the tale is simplifying somewhat."
285,0,"Liu Bei has a rare episode of failure, attempting to strategise against Cao Cao, who outwits him tremendously. There's a great scene of the two military leaders meeting for a parley in the no-mans-land between their two armies that's a fascinating piece of drama, before Liu Bei is sent running, once again a leader without an army as Cao Cao mops up in the north. There's a short scene with Sun Quan, now fully bearded, establishing his rule in the south as a benevolent leader who listens to his advisors, before we see Liu Bei and his brothers struggle in the realm of Liu Biao (kind of a silly episode, although there is one really great episode showing the three brothers training with each other, bare-backed with rippling muscles, and also the famous horse Dilu's 30 metre leap during Liu Bei's escape from treachery). When Liu Bei enlists Xu Shu, his fortunes as a general change, and while Cao Cao's cowardly machinations mean that he doesn't last long Xu Shu comes through for Liu Bei, as role is ultimately to be nothing more than a means of introducing one of the great characters of Chinese literature - Zhuge Liang! Can't wait for Volume 09!!"
286,0,"Caution: Although it is listed as a different version of the same product, the $3.99 Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this.  The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book. I was able to return for a refund, but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe."
287,0,"I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for ""Journey to the West"" and ""Outlaws of the Marsh"".  I tried a different translation for ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well."
288,0,I prefer the Moss Robert's version because:
289,0,1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others)
290,0,"2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class"
291,0,3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version
292,0,"Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period."
293,0,"The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads."
294,0,"If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms."
295,0,"FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor."
296,0,"I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well."
297,0,"It's a challenging read for those of us who didn't grow up with these characters and stories, but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations, you can get completely absorbed in it. After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself."
298,0,"If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this. Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood. The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China, not so much in the rest of the world. If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book."
299,0,Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:
300,0,"""Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
301,0,Compare this with Taylor's translation:
302,0,"""Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity."""
303,0,Or Hegel's:
304,0,"""Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce."""
305,0,"It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator."
306,0,"In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire."
307,0,"It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the ""Three Kingdoms"" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together."
308,0,"For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience."
309,0,"The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map."
310,0,"The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's ""just"" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history."
311,0,"A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.)"

315,0,"The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment."
316,0,Pros:
317,0,- This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight.
318,0,"- Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang."
319,0,Cons:
320,0,The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves.
321,0,- There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before.
322,0,"- The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape."

324,0,"The annotations & footnotes for Volume 1 are stored in the back of Volume 2. So if you care about any of these, which there are A TON, you need to buy the second book & lug it around with you. Which these books are not small or light by any means."
325,0,No where in the book itself or on this store page does it mention the appendix being in the other volume. I had to dig around online til i saw this briefly mentioned in a review for vol. 2
326,0,"Great book, although I should mention a complaint with Amazon for using bubble wrap. I couldn't return it because I was going overseas within a day, and it was simply too much hassle. The book arrived damaged, because bubble wrap doesn't protect the book. However, they have accepted my complaint, and agreed to a replacement (Thankyou!)"
327,0,"The book itself is a classic, and this is a good translation, although I want the one that starts: ""They say the momentum of history was ever thus: the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide."" That is surely one of the greatest openings in all of literature; this one isn't quite at that level. I think that version might be adapted from Moss Roberts (the same translator as this book), or it may be his earlier, abridged version."
328,0,"This is one of the four classical chinese novels, and if you are looking to connect with the Middle Kingdom and its past, this is a great (though rather heavy) place to start."
329,0,Great!
330,0,Though it’s a classic The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is long and slow moving. This version is much shorter and quickly paced.
331,0,The translation is first rate.
332,0,"Having waded through the long version I suggest this shorter, more enjoyable translation."
333,0,"The way to read Romance of the Three Kingdoms is to enter their medieval world and live each moment, the way you experience life. You submerge yourself in these books, and become so immersed in the finely embroidered story that you don't care whether it ever ends. Addictive - I picked it up every chance I got, and even found myself dreaming about the story. Don't try to read these books in a week or two and then move on to something else! You'll shortchange the story and yourself."
334,0,"Like many Westerners, I suppose, I had some trouble tracking all the names - there are many characters, and some characters have several unique names depending upon what's going on or who is addressing them. But as the story progresses and your familiarity grows, this becomes less of a problem. When I started I kept lists of characters and even made notes amplifying the character's identity and relationships; but this quickly became cumbersome, and in the end I found I didn't need it. You become familiar with the main characters and easily follow their vicissitudes as the story moves along. The story becomes the main thing, and it is great!"
335,0,"I was introduced to Romance of the Three Kingdoms by a Taiwanese friend, and I'll be forever grateful to him. Wonderful saga - put it on your list of must-reads!"
336,0,"This novel is a Chinese classic and their equivalent to Western tales like Macbeth. Following three great Dynasties of Shu (Liu), Wu (Sun), and Wei (Cao), the second half sets up the titular war of the Three Kingdoms and works toward the historical conclusion, all while showcasing great heroes and dastardly villains."
337,0,"It's a really long read, and there are many, many characters, each of whom may have several different names, and none of the names are easy for Westerners to remember; nevertheless, some very important mythological and historical characters permeate the majority of the book, for example Kwan Kung.  You see a statue of Kwan Kung in a lot of Chinese businesses.  He is a red-faced king who carries a long staff with a blade attached that is useful for chopping enemy heads off.  His character is prominent, and his legend is understood by the majority of Han Chinese."
338,0,"The story centers around the fall of the Han Dynasty, which is considered a ""Golden Age"" of Chinese History.  I recommend reading this, just to gain an understanding of the attitudes and point of view of most Chinese.  On the whole, most Chinese are very proud of their history, and most claim that the history is 5,000 years.  Just keep reading, even if you're confused by the names and the discontinuities; by the time you're at the end, it should begin to sink in."

340,0,"This, along with the first volume, combine to make one of the most engaging epic stories in human history.  It can be dense at times and readers may find themselves reading only one chapter at a time, most of them being only ten pages, but each chapter is a rich story in itself.  Characters appear and die rapidly so readers my find themselves, at first, going back to previous chapters to become reacquainted with some to try to understand their significance.  This quality can slow the reading process.  However, this book will provide you with years of good reading material and introduce you to great heroes and impressive strategies."
341,0,Gave as a gift.

345,0,"Henry Kissinger talked about this book in his ""On China."" Explains a lot if you're trying to understand China's hard line on dissent. They seem to think any disagreement is an invitation to anarchy, and this book explains very graphically what anarchy can mean. It's a shame. But the book itself is quite interesting. Someone said the names are tough. Yes indeed."
346,0,"""Romance of the three Kingdoms"" is a great classic and I love it very much. I consider it to be even better than ""War and Peace"" of Leon Tolstoy. I admired some of the characters, but more particularly, Chuko Liang (or Zhuge Liang for his genius, loyalty and sense of humanity. I read the book twice over the last two months. However, what I disliked are some typo mistakes. Typo mistakes seem to be more frequent in ebooks than in printed books. Something must be done to correct this."
347,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
348,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
349,0,"Now with this, the eleventh volume, we get one of the main climaxes of the tale - the battle of the Red Cliff, between the forces of Cao Cao and Song Quan, with Liu Bei and his army taking a back seat. In fact, the main character of this tale is probably Zhou Yu, who seems to be running the show, although it is his hostage Zhuge Liang, who is pulling the strings in actual fact. Strange schemers like Pang Tong enter the picture, only to disappear again, and we see both Cao Cao and Zhou Yu nearly descend into madness, as is seen by the former's drunken, murderous antics during a drunken banquet on the eve of battle (who celebrates a victory before the fight has begun?!?), and the latter's strange disease. The closing one third of the book is occupied by the annihilation of Cao Cao's army and navy, and his tragic retreat."
350,0,"The books were created after the film, but there are many episodes from the film that do not appear in this book, such as Zhuge Liang's romance, or the epidemic of the soldiers. But the fire remains, and we also get the humiliation and tragic retreat of the prime minister of Han, which is drawn out and quite thoroughly dramatized. Nice!!"
351,0,"This book follows the same path as the first two in the series: namely, ""prince persistently pursues woman overcoming her fears."" Unfortunately, it doesn't have much of the charm of the first two books, and has a particularly unrealistic ending given the prior established beliefs of the two main characters."
352,0,"Rafe carries overbearing worry due to a traumatic event in his past that was explained in the previous book. Genesis despises being hovered over because she hates feeling controlled. These are both valid emotional responses that people might have to previous experiences, and watching them develop through their struggles could have been compelling and beautiful."
353,0,"Unfortunately, the ending jarred me out of the story completely. Rafe did something that Genesis had repeatedly and clearly told him not to, but she forgave him quickly due to the result of his actions. I don't feel as strongly about Genesis's beliefs as Genesis does, but I bristled at Rafe's choice given Genesis's previous insistence he should *not* do what he ended up doing."
354,0,"Aside from my problem with that, I also felt the side characters were forgettable compared to those in Royal Date and Royal Chase. I struggled to remember which names referred to which stereotypical small-town personalities."
355,0,"Some things I liked about this book were the gaming references and the glimpses we get into Kat and Lemon's happily-ever-afters.  I gave this book three stars because I did end up finishing the book, enjoyed those parts of it, and believe its Kindle price is very reasonable for what you get."
356,0,"It was nice to finish Genesis and Rafe's story, but it wasn't nearly as fun as Lemon and Dante.  This story needed help. This Iowan farm girl wanna be vet went out into the winter weather one too many times without appropriate winter clothing.  That didn't fit. Farm girls are practical. They find her friend's cabin at night and it doesn't have electricity but it has a refrigerator with expired eggs and condiments? That didn't fit. Most of the events in the story take place around a roof fundraiser for the church she has been attending since a young girl, but she ""prays to the vehicular god"" and thanks the ""theater gods."" That didn't fit. We don't get to really know much of Rafe's character - he is simply a man with a painful past and a broken heart who falls in love again and has lots of money to show his love.  Loved the extra characters, her aunt and friends. Got to go to Kat's wedding. We saw some of what happened on Marry Me that caused the mix up in the 2nd book. The story was okay for filling in the blanks in the series but really the story was lacking and she, like many other reviewers posted, was whiny and ridiculous for a woman who had reasons to be fearful  and should be grateful for someone's protective measures and care. I don't think she is cut out to live in Monterra so I hope they settle in Iowa and work on healing from their past hurts and don't spend all their time playing computer games. How about a story about Marco? That would be fun. And how about it be from his perspective!!!"
357,0,"In the previous book when Genesis character was introduced, she was a sweet lovable farm girl. In this book, primarily about Genesis and Rafe, all her psychopathology is revealed. She could be lovable and sympathetic at times, and a self absorbed neurotic victim of her mentally abusive childhood at others. Her lack of ability to trust anyone along with her hurt and hate of Rafe for his previous perceived “terrible lying“ had her being terrible to him despite his showing up obviously still in love with her and doing everything possible to win her forgiveness. His perceived wrongdoing seemed not as bad as she was carrying on. Her attraction and neurotic rejection of him throughout the book got a little old. Not all the book was irritating,thus the four star rating. The story was actually good. It could have been edited to shorten a little and get rid of some of the unreasonable angst. I really liked her in the previous book but this character was not as likable or fun. She had serious issues causing this however, which I presume the author was trying to portray her overcoming. I would recommend the book despite all of this, because of the good story."
358,0,"Another charming entry in Sariah Wilson's Royals of Monterra series. If you're looking for romance with heart and emotion, you can't miss this series. Royal Games follows Marry Me runner-up (or winner?) Genesis Kelly as she tries to pick up the pieces of her broken heart after the events of Royal Chase. I don't want to spoil any part of this book but I will say every time I thought I had the story all figured out, something else happened and kept me turning the pages. I'm glad this series has developed it's own Kindle World so I can keep reading more about Monterra and can't wait to see what the author writes next!"
359,0,SENSUALITY RATING: NO Profanity; NO sexual encounters
360,0,*Great book for an Adult that is looking for clean romance and not “feel” so YA*
361,0,GENRE: Modern day; Romance
362,0,SETTING: Frog Hollow Iowa
363,0,"CENTRAL FEMALE CHARACTER: GENESIS Kelly; stubborn, determined, a Treky, loves online gaming."
364,0,"CENTRAL MALE CHARACTER: RAFE aka Prince Rafael of Monterra; persistent, giving, gaming geek technology savvy."
365,0,SYNOPSIS: All he did was humiliate her on that dating show. She and her Aunt are barely staying afloat. Luckily Aunt Sylvia has rented the house outback.
366,0,"WHAT I LIKED: “Personally, I think you should lower your shields and prepare to be boarded”. (NOT boarded as in sex). Love the fact that it can be considered a mature adult romance without sex and profanity."
367,0,WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: What is there not to like. I loved the book which is why I will be reading it a second time.
368,0,"OVERALL RATING: (5) stars because I read this before I read book I and as a result because of an ability for the author to make you “wish it was me” with a sigh, I will definitely read the series."
369,0,"I love Sariah Wilson!  Her books are all really good! I have read the books and listened to them as well.  Book one ""Royal Date"" and book two"" Royal Chase were my favorites in this series, But I really liked this one too!  The stories are sweet and clean without being prudish!  She definitely knows how to write an excellent romantic story, and it's funny too!!  My only complaint is that, she still hasn't made ""Royal Date into a audio version!  I am still waiting!!  All her books can be read by all  from ages 12 to 100!!"
370,0,The previous book gave so much potential for this story. Unfortunately this story was a big zero. The main character was so self centered. Yes she had a right to be upset because she believed the prince deceived her but she forgot that she had signed up for a TV show where anything could happen. The poor prince should have dumped her.
371,0,"I just started this series and it's great.  I like Sariah Wilson's writing, especially her little life tips. This book had a different feel from the first two.  I liked the first two better and the 4th novella.  Genesis' character of stubbornness and lack of common sense was a little off putting to me. It seemed too long for the storyline and more on the horror side."
372,0,"I enjoyed this book and it was a page turner for me, especially since there was some suspense thrown in, but despite Genesis' traumatic background, it was hard for me to sympathize; she was a bit too prideful for me.  Someone finally sat her down and told her what, but it was a bit farther on in the book.  Overall, it was still a fun, romantic, clean read.  This author does a good job with clever self-talk."
373,0,"I give this book 3 stars for clean writing with some passion & spark. But I had to make myself read this book in stages - It was hard to get past the incessant complaining & whining by Genesis. Here's an apologetic, handsome true gentleman that she can't forgive - and that repeats a 100 times over in this book despite her friends telling her to forgive him.  I liked book 1 & 2. Book 3 is tough for me. I had to get through it since I paid $3 for it."
374,0,"Caution: Although it is listed as a different version of the same product, the $3.99 Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this.  The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book. I was able to return for a refund, but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe."
375,0,"I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for ""Journey to the West"" and ""Outlaws of the Marsh"".  I tried a different translation for ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well."
376,0,I prefer the Moss Robert's version because:
377,0,1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others)
378,0,"2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class"
379,0,3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version
380,0,"Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period."
381,0,"The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads."
382,0,"If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms."
383,0,"FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor."
384,0,"I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well."
385,0,"It's a challenging read for those of us who didn't grow up with these characters and stories, but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations, you can get completely absorbed in it. After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself."
386,0,"If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this. Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood. The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China, not so much in the rest of the world. If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book."
387,0,Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:
388,0,"""Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
389,0,Compare this with Taylor's translation:
390,0,"""Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity."""
391,0,Or Hegel's:
392,0,"""Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce."""
393,0,"It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator."
394,0,"In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire."
395,0,"It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the ""Three Kingdoms"" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together."
396,0,"For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience."
397,0,"The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map."
398,0,"The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's ""just"" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history."
399,0,"A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing.

419,0,"The sixth part of the story builds on the fifth (of course), which was about retaliation and murder, but also about mind games and machination. This one is dominated by battle, starting out with Guan Yu's choice as an isolated warrior, fighting one one-eyed general after another, being reunited with an old ally, enjoying drinking battles with his temporary allies, kung fu practice, some idealism... Cao Cao contemplates Guan Yu's character, as Guan Yu fights for Cao Cao against Yuan Shao (temporary ally/hostage of Liu Bei) at the Battle of BaiMa. There's the strange honour of military advisors, before we get into bloody battles and fighting with Guan Yu - and it's quite bloody!! There's a push to the frontier, and we get towards... volume seven!!"
420,0,"This book follows the same path as the first two in the series: namely, ""prince persistently pursues woman overcoming her fears."" Unfortunately, it doesn't have much of the charm of the first two books, and has a particularly unrealistic ending given the prior established beliefs of the two main characters."
421,0,"Rafe carries overbearing worry due to a traumatic event in his past that was explained in the previous book. Genesis despises being hovered over because she hates feeling controlled. These are both valid emotional responses that people might have to previous experiences, and watching them develop through their struggles could have been compelling and beautiful."
422,0,"Unfortunately, the ending jarred me out of the story completely. Rafe did something that Genesis had repeatedly and clearly told him not to, but she forgave him quickly due to the result of his actions. I don't feel as strongly about Genesis's beliefs as Genesis does, but I bristled at Rafe's choice given Genesis's previous insistence he should *not* do what he ended up doing."
423,0,"Aside from my problem with that, I also felt the side characters were forgettable compared to those in Royal Date and Royal Chase. I struggled to remember which names referred to which stereotypical small-town personalities."
424,0,"Some things I liked about this book were the gaming references and the glimpses we get into Kat and Lemon's happily-ever-afters.  I gave this book three stars because I did end up finishing the book, enjoyed those parts of it, and believe its Kindle price is very reasonable for what you get."
425,0,"It was nice to finish Genesis and Rafe's story, but it wasn't nearly as fun as Lemon and Dante.  This story needed help. This Iowan farm girl wanna be vet went out into the winter weather one too many times without appropriate winter clothing.  That didn't fit. Farm girls are practical. They find her friend's cabin at night and it doesn't have electricity but it has a refrigerator with expired eggs and condiments? That didn't fit. Most of the events in the story take place around a roof fundraiser for the church she has been attending since a young girl, but she ""prays to the vehicular god"" and thanks the ""theater gods."" That didn't fit. We don't get to really know much of Rafe's character - he is simply a man with a painful past and a broken heart who falls in love again and has lots of money to show his love.  Loved the extra characters, her aunt and friends. Got to go to Kat's wedding. We saw some of what happened on Marry Me that caused the mix up in the 2nd book. The story was okay for filling in the blanks in the series but really the story was lacking and she, like many other reviewers posted, was whiny and ridiculous for a woman who had reasons to be fearful  and should be grateful for someone's protective measures and care. I don't think she is cut out to live in Monterra so I hope they settle in Iowa and work on healing from their past hurts and don't spend all their time playing computer games. How about a story about Marco? That would be fun. And how about it be from his perspective!!!"
426,0,"In the previous book when Genesis character was introduced, she was a sweet lovable farm girl. In this book, primarily about Genesis and Rafe, all her psychopathology is revealed. She could be lovable and sympathetic at times, and a self absorbed neurotic victim of her mentally abusive childhood at others. Her lack of ability to trust anyone along with her hurt and hate of Rafe for his previous perceived “terrible lying“ had her being terrible to him despite his showing up obviously still in love with her and doing everything possible to win her forgiveness. His perceived wrongdoing seemed not as bad as she was carrying on. Her attraction and neurotic rejection of him throughout the book got a little old. Not all the book was irritating,thus the four star rating. The story was actually good. It could have been edited to shorten a little and get rid of some of the unreasonable angst. I really liked her in the previous book but this character was not as likable or fun. She had serious issues causing this however, which I presume the author was trying to portray her overcoming. I would recommend the book despite all of this, because of the good story."
427,0,"Another charming entry in Sariah Wilson's Royals of Monterra series. If you're looking for romance with heart and emotion, you can't miss this series. Royal Games follows Marry Me runner-up (or winner?) Genesis Kelly as she tries to pick up the pieces of her broken heart after the events of Royal Chase. I don't want to spoil any part of this book but I will say every time I thought I had the story all figured out, something else happened and kept me turning the pages. I'm glad this series has developed it's own Kindle World so I can keep reading more about Monterra and can't wait to see what the author writes next!"
428,0,SENSUALITY RATING: NO Profanity; NO sexual encounters
429,0,*Great book for an Adult that is looking for clean romance and not “feel” so YA*
430,0,GENRE: Modern day; Romance
431,0,SETTING: Frog Hollow Iowa
432,0,"CENTRAL FEMALE CHARACTER: GENESIS Kelly; stubborn, determined, a Treky, loves online gaming."
433,0,"CENTRAL MALE CHARACTER: RAFE aka Prince Rafael of Monterra; persistent, giving, gaming geek technology savvy."
434,0,SYNOPSIS: All he did was humiliate her on that dating show. She and her Aunt are barely staying afloat. Luckily Aunt Sylvia has rented the house outback.
435,0,"WHAT I LIKED: “Personally, I think you should lower your shields and prepare to be boarded”. (NOT boarded as in sex). Love the fact that it can be considered a mature adult romance without sex and profanity."
436,0,WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: What is there not to like. I loved the book which is why I will be reading it a second time.
437,0,"OVERALL RATING: (5) stars because I read this before I read book I and as a result because of an ability for the author to make you “wish it was me” with a sigh, I will definitely read the series."
438,0,"I love Sariah Wilson!  Her books are all really good! I have read the books and listened to them as well.  Book one ""Royal Date"" and book two"" Royal Chase were my favorites in this series, But I really liked this one too!  The stories are sweet and clean without being prudish!  She definitely knows how to write an excellent romantic story, and it's funny too!!  My only complaint is that, she still hasn't made ""Royal Date into a audio version!  I am still waiting!!  All her books can be read by all  from ages 12 to 100!!"
439,0,The previous book gave so much potential for this story. Unfortunately this story was a big zero. The main character was so self centered. Yes she had a right to be upset because she believed the prince deceived her but she forgot that she had signed up for a TV show where anything could happen. The poor prince should have dumped her.
440,0,"I just started this series and it's great.  I like Sariah Wilson's writing, especially her little life tips. This book had a different feel from the first two.  I liked the first two better and the 4th novella.  Genesis' character of stubbornness and lack of common sense was a little off putting to me. It seemed too long for the storyline and more on the horror side."
441,0,"I enjoyed this book and it was a page turner for me, especially since there was some suspense thrown in, but despite Genesis' traumatic background, it was hard for me to sympathize; she was a bit too prideful for me.  Someone finally sat her down and told her what, but it was a bit farther on in the book.  Overall, it was still a fun, romantic, clean read.  This author does a good job with clever self-talk."
442,0,"I give this book 3 stars for clean writing with some passion & spark. But I had to make myself read this book in stages - It was hard to get past the incessant complaining & whining by Genesis. Here's an apologetic, handsome true gentleman that she can't forgive - and that repeats a 100 times over in this book despite her friends telling her to forgive him.  I liked book 1 & 2. Book 3 is tough for me. I had to get through it since I paid $3 for it."
443,0,"So much has been revealed here in this book. We learn more about the prophecy, more about Thalia and her role, the Fae prophecy, and Rafe. There didn’t seem to be a whole lot of action in this book, mostly just in-law drama, and information."
444,0,"Thalia is still badass and confident as ever. I like how the author is keeping the character’s personalities consistent in each book. I’ve read series where it seems like the author struggles to maintain the same portrayal of the characters, but that isn’t any issue here. We see Thalia and her 3 mates grow and explore their relationship further. She has now claimed all 3... which basically means she has boinked with all 3 now."
445,0,Another great addition to the series and I’m eager to start the next book to find out what other drama Thalia and her 3 mates can find.
446,0,"Triad is book 3 of the TriAlpha series and the continuity issues I saw in book 2 don't seem to have bled over to this book; it's a much smoother read. There is a bit of redundancy in the words used (such as intrinsic), but I may be noticing repeats as I'm reading the books back-to-back. I like where the storyline is heading, but another annoying cliffhanger. Off to book 4..."
447,0,Blast you Serena! That ending... You know what I'm talking about. (insert stink eye) But man oh man what a ride! I love Thalia and her attitude for the crap that keeps coming her way shows how amazing she is. Her mates keep her ground which is how it should be. I seriously cannot wait for the next book. Please don't keep us waiting!
448,0,"These books just keep getting better and better. I love these characters so much. I feel mental and emotionally involved with them to a point I have to remind myself they aren't real. You just want to sit down and devour all these books because they are so amazing,"
449,0,This series just keeps getting better with each book I read in it. I love everything about it. I would definitely recommend this book.
450,0,I can’t explain how much I loved this book the more I learn the more I need to know what happens next so glad I don’t have to wait to find out
451,0,Twists and turns in plot? Check. Wonderfully complex characters? Check. A stunning world that sucks you in? Check. What more could you want?
452,0,Love this series. It’s seriously hot.
453,0,"In previous books, there was a cliffhanger of course. It's pretty typical in a series. This one though? Harsh, Serena, harsh."
454,0,"Ok so on to the actual review and less of my foot stomping. So the writing over the series has improved in flow. That or I've gotten used to it. Not sure. It has never been bad, just not the flow I prefer. So either it has changed somewhat closer to my preferred style or as I said, I've simply gotten more used to it. The dialogue has always been well done. The editing is well done, as usual. I noticed no errors in spelling, grammar or continuity."
455,0,"Thalia, as always, is a BA. In this book, she has a lot of things she must adjust to. Yet, she does so with far more grace than I probably would have. I do hope she gets her ...... back though. The guys also have some issues and some big revelations to sort through."
456,0,"Overall I would recommend this book, as well as the rest of the series."
457,0,"Why is this like crack for me? For some unknown-to-me reason, I thought this was a trilogy? Maybe the triad theme? I have no idea why. But, no! Cliffhanger-city, baby, and apparently I'm the mayor. I don't know. I really hate cliffhangers, but S. A. has been so freaking faithful about getting those books out in a timely manner that I ain't even mad. I am knuckle biting. How can this be resolved? How will the big-bad get defeated? I don't want to spoil anything here in a review, but I have all the unanswered questions. Arrrgh! There were plot twists on top of plot twists in this one."
458,0,"I'm ready for Thalia to kick all the ass in book four. I NEED her to kick all the ass. She's been through enough, and I want to see her triumph in a big way. She's an awesome heroine, and I love how she's imperfectly perfect. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next book."
459,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
460,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
461,0,"Now with this, the tenth volume, we get just what is said in the title - a great deal of discussion, and hardly any battle after the retreat at the first part of the book and Zhao Yun's splendid mission into enemy territory to try to save Liu Bei's family (there are a few beheadings, though). Zhang Fei freaks out, even Liu Bei freaks out too!! Zhuge Liang enters Sun Zhao's camp and molds the will of his court advisors like clay, although Sun Zhao's sister partially undoes some of his good work. At this point Zhou Yu also becomes an important character in the story, and a keen rival to Zhuge Liang. Guan Yu shows off his bad-assery, when he's ""not much fun to drink with."" When asked to clarify, he adds ""Let's just say that when liquor is flowing around me, blood flow is never far behind!"" COOL!! Zhou Yu's drunken sword flame dance for his old friend Jiang Gan is a pretty nutty episode, and so are Cao Cao's impulsive beheadings of his naval commanders and Zhuge Liang's famous 100,000 arrows episode. Now everything's ready for the battle episode called Red Cliff!"
462,0,"War of Words, like the books the immediately precede and follow it, forms part of the plot of the John Woo film also called Red Cliff, which does a far more dramatic job of telling the story of Red Cliff, particularly the gambit about Cao Cao's naval commanders, and the 100,000 arrows deceit. Great!"
463,0,"I've just finished reading the whole book in Chinese for the XXth time. And everytime I read it, I get a different aspect of the book. I was first attracted by the television series on Romance of The Three Kingdoms, and  started to read the book itself, it was fantastic, filled with action and  tactics in military and politics. Then when I re-read the book again and  again, it gave me a deep insight of the cunning of humans, and the  philosophy of the Chinese at that time."
464,0,"But the author Luo Kwang Chung  wasn't being fair to every character. ChaoChau was written as an evil  conspirator and LiuBei was potraited to be a great hero. But was it really  that way? In real history, the time of the Three kingdoms didn't had a  clear distinct between evil and good, but the author wrote it in this way  as in his own sympathy to Liubei, which in ancient China was  more popular  for his loyal to the Han dynasty and sympathy to the peasants."
465,0,"Nevertheless, that's why this is called a historic novel and not  'facts'. So any people reading this book: Read it as a novel and not a  history textbook."
466,0,There will always be varying degrees of satisfaction when text is translated; I don't see this book as an exception.
467,0,"I found the book to be very captivating, not poorly-written by any means.  It has it's share of flaws, but only the most discriminating readers will be disturbed by them.  Don't wait for a ""perfect"" translation of this great tale to come along; even the most harsh critics of these two volumes will acknowledge that an English translation doesn't get much better than this.  A few errors shouldn't stop anyone from picking up this book."
468,0,"My fascination with this epic tale began with playing the video games.  I eventually discovered this book, and have purchased the VCD movie set since.  I'm glad I read this book before seeing the series.  The series is *superb* to see, but the English subtitles leave much to be desired.  Therefore, I highly recommend this book to anyone who has experienced the series or video games.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves epic, classic literature."
469,0,"I am a Chinese and I have read this book for a thousand times(first time I was around 16). The characteristics of people in this book are so diversified and charming. I really think the author was doing a great job  on this. Even though the ""poems"" in the novel cannot compare with  the genuine Chinese poems, I still think it is a high-value history novel  to read."
470,0,"Please notice that some of the characters don't exist and some  stories in the novel are different from real histroy records. That's why we  call it ""Romance"" instead of ""Records""."
471,0,"By the way, I  am glad to know that people from Japan and USA also like this book."
472,0,The most amazing book you can read. It will awe you with it's amazing plot!
473,0,"Although this is a chinese book,it is also very big in Japan.I bet 100% of the Japanese Know,have heard of this book,and 60% have read it either in book or comic.It is a immortal literaly work on the men who lived for the dream to unite China and died for.It is not some corny super hero stuff,but based on actual histroy and is so real. P.S. If you wanted to purchase the comic-although it is Japanese-,Iwould recommend you SOTEN-KORO by KING GONTA and I Hagin.Published by Koudansha."
474,0,"I am an avid reader, I read almost exclusively fantasy and Science Fiction but I also like history, especially pre 1600 AD Asian History. The era this novel portrays is one of the  most interesting of all to me, only The Mongol Empire and Celtic, and of course; Samurai history is even close to being this fascinating.  If you have ever Played the video games of the same name, and found them even remotely interesting, read this and bring the game into a new light for you.  If not, read it just for the Rich and in Depth story that spans all time with its (Although reletively unknown in America) effect on history.  You will not be dissapointed in one bit, It is a Long and thouroughly enjoyable read.  Also it should be noted  that I am only 16 now and was 14 when I read it.  Like I said, you will not regret reading this."
475,0,"The way to read Romance of the Three Kingdoms is to enter their medieval world and live each moment, the way you experience life. You submerge yourself in these books, and become so immersed in the finely embroidered story that you don't care whether it ever ends. Addictive - I picked it up every chance I got, and even found myself dreaming about the story. Don't try to read these books in a week or two and then move on to something else! You'll shortchange the story and yourself."
476,0,"Like many Westerners, I suppose, I had some trouble tracking all the names - there are many characters, and some characters have several unique names depending upon what's going on or who is addressing them. But as the story progresses and your familiarity grows, this becomes less of a problem. When I started I kept lists of characters and even made notes amplifying the character's identity and relationships; but this quickly became cumbersome, and in the end I found I didn't need it. You become familiar with the main characters and easily follow their vicissitudes as the story moves along. The story becomes the main thing, and it is great!"
477,0,"I was introduced to Romance of the Three Kingdoms by a Taiwanese friend, and I'll be forever grateful to him. Wonderful saga - put it on your list of must-reads!"
478,0,"This novel is a Chinese classic and their equivalent to Western tales like Macbeth. Following three great Dynasties of Shu (Liu), Wu (Sun), and Wei (Cao), the second half sets up the titular war of the Three Kingdoms and works toward the historical conclusion, all while showcasing great heroes and dastardly villains."
479,0,"It's a really long read, and there are many, many characters, each of whom may have several different names, and none of the names are easy for Westerners to remember; nevertheless, some very important mythological and historical characters permeate the majority of the book, for example Kwan Kung.  You see a statue of Kwan Kung in a lot of Chinese businesses.  He is a red-faced king who carries a long staff with a blade attached that is useful for chopping enemy heads off.  His character is prominent, and his legend is understood by the majority of Han Chinese."
480,0,"The story centers around the fall of the Han Dynasty, which is considered a ""Golden Age"" of Chinese History.  I recommend reading this, just to gain an understanding of the attitudes and point of view of most Chinese.  On the whole, most Chinese are very proud of their history, and most claim that the history is 5,000 years.  Just keep reading, even if you're confused by the names and the discontinuities; by the time you're at the end, it should begin to sink in."

482,0,"This, along with the first volume, combine to make one of the most engaging epic stories in human history.  It can be dense at times and readers may find themselves reading only one chapter at a time, most of them being only ten pages, but each chapter is a rich story in itself.  Characters appear and die rapidly so readers my find themselves, at first, going back to previous chapters to become reacquainted with some to try to understand their significance.  This quality can slow the reading process.  However, this book will provide you with years of good reading material and introduce you to great heroes and impressive strategies."
483,0,Gave as a gift.

487,0,"Henry Kissinger talked about this book in his ""On China."" Explains a lot if you're trying to understand China's hard line on dissent. They seem to think any disagreement is an invitation to anarchy, and this book explains very graphically what anarchy can mean. It's a shame. But the book itself is quite interesting. Someone said the names are tough. Yes indeed."
488,0,"""Romance of the three Kingdoms"" is a great classic and I love it very much. I consider it to be even better than ""War and Peace"" of Leon Tolstoy. I admired some of the characters, but more particularly, Chuko Liang (or Zhuge Liang for his genius, loyalty and sense of humanity. I read the book twice over the last two months. However, what I disliked are some typo mistakes. Typo mistakes seem to be more frequent in ebooks than in printed books. Something must be done to correct this."
489,0,"In THE BATTLE OF CHIBI, Hock G. Tjoa has translated the pivotal section of THE ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS, and provided readers with an accessible, accurate and stirring glimpse into that brutal world."
490,0,"The action here, as in the entire book, concerns the deeds of three great heroes, a great sage-strategist, a classic villain and many others who are somewhere in between. All live in a time when the world is in constantly at war. There is not a moment when plots are not being hatched, cabals and alliances made and undermined, battles fought, murders planned, ways to seize power calculated."
491,0,"The pursuit of dominance distorts all traditional values and shapes the psychology, virtuous or otherwise, of every single person in the book. Hock is faithful in conveying the devastating impact of this great classic in which no amount of goodness, wisdom, elegance, guile, or valor can enable one to escape from endless and unrelenting violence."
492,0,"The Battle of Chibi is a modern translation of selections (310 pages) of the classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms, described by historian Francis Fukuyama in his epic Origins of Political Order.  Fukuyama writes that Romance is ""one of the greatest Chinese historical novels . . . The significance of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms in shaping the historical consciousness of modern Chinese has been compared to that of the historical plays of Shakespeare, and the novel has been turned into video games and countless movies"" (Fukuyama 2011, 144-5).  This translation by Hock Tjoa is dramatic and well worth reading!"
493,0,Great telling of a great battle. Simply written and looks great on my note 3
494,0,"I would describe The Battle of Chibi as an epic novel of war, but also there was a lot of romance and poetry in the story. It did take a little time for me to get into the book. Reading the e-book version, there was a huge amount of preamble and explanation as well as a guide for how to read the book before I could actually get to the actual book. And then once you start reading, there are huge number of names to keep track of.  It was a little daunting."
495,0,"Ultimately however, it's an incredibly compelling story about a battle between three kingdoms led respectively by Bei, Cao, and Quan.  Although there are many characters, you do get to know very well about seven or so characters and become very attached and want to know more about their story. It starts to pick up a lot before about page 100, and by about the halfway point, I could not stop reading!"
496,0,"I love books where I actually can learn something by reading it, and this is a great example. I love learning the Chinese ancient culture. I thought this was very well translated and I love the language of it.  The descriptions were poetic and beautiful."
497,0,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.  It does take some time to get into, but it is well worth it!"
498,0,"What makes ""The Battle of Chibi,"" a 300 pager,such a worthwhile read  is a feeling of global impact. Here is a mythos/history of ancient China worth absorbing. The world view of the most populous nation on earth and one that retains much of its ancient heritage should interest us, yet Western readers know little of its evolution. In this fascinating novel, which is part history, part fiction, part drama, and part poetry, Hock G. Tjoa ably takes on the mantle of translator and literary interpreter for  a battle along a river that determined four hundred years of  ancient Chinese history."
499,0,"Tjoa does an excellent job at meeting his goal of providing the original in a more  ""readable and lively language as well as internal consistency.""  It's a worthwhile though not an easy read. As a boy in the book says, ""I cannot remember all the names."""
500,0,"At the outset, the author provides useful background. The historical events were originally recounted in a classic Ming novel, ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms,"" written in 1400 by Luo Guanzhong.  In turn the ""Romance"" was a compilation of work by  writers living in the third and fourth centuries AD. (The Arthurian legend immediately comes to mind.)  Luo's  version is in four volumes of 120 scenes/chapters,  the first 80 of which is about the decline of the Han Dynasty and the rise of three kingdoms,  a period of transition from 184 to 280 AD. Tjoa characterizes the divergence  as one  ""between imperial unity and fragmentation."""
501,0,"The selections chosen from the ""Romance"" center on the Battle of Chibi (Red Cliffs), dated 208AD, which Tjoa points out was ""the tipping point"" between the Han and Three Kingdoms periods. One of the three realms, the Shu,  was  led by Han loyalist Liu Bei. A second,  the Wei,  was led by Cao Cao the Usurper. Cao's plan was to become the new unifier of China, but his ambitions disqualified him in the eyes of the other two leaders.  A third realm, the Wu led by Sun Quan, lay on the fringe of what was called All under Heaven, a name, says Tjoa, that equates to a Greco-Roman term, ""the whole known civiilized world.""  An interesting pattern emerges in the novel's three-part structure.  To my eye, a dialectic of  thesis, antithesis, and synthesis  unifies the diversity of the  structural components as well as underlining the clash of cultures. The dynasty's decline is vividly characterized by its eunuchs,  warlords, and rebels."
502,0,"I became engaged in the story also through the spare, dramatically staged dialogue and the pleasing literary elements. The title of  Chapter 8 (""Like Fish Seeking Water"") is one  example of how metaphor and poetry are used to illustrate what is going on. Here's another: ""Screens, decorated with feathers,/Divide the space inside/Bamboo fences and fragrant flowers/Define the space outside."""
503,0,"A new world order emerges from the divisiveness, and though the country is no longer unified, neither is it so insularly focused.  At the end of the day, Tjoa's work is historical romance  in the most classic sense of the term. It would certainly lend itself to screen adaptation."
504,0,"Anne Carlisle, Ph. D., reviewer and author of ""Home Schooling: The Fire Night Ball"""
505,0,This is the second book by Hock Tjoa that I have read.
506,0,"The Battle of Chibi is the translation of the well-known Chinese epic The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It starts at the end of the Han Dynasty, 169 A.D. The whole time period is represented in a fascinating way that is made understandable to lay people. In this translation, the insight into the world and thoughts of the Chinese during this time period is accessible and easy(ish) to read. The power struggle between the warlords and the intrigue between those striving for power is really human nature and has never been any different. What I find fascinating is the sizes of the armies which must correlate with the size of the population at the time. This is a great introduction to the ancient Chinese culture and this is a must-read for anyone interested in this."
507,0,"I love that this book is so welcoming to those of us with limited knowledge of Chinese history -- the ""Note About Reading This Book"" that starts the book is a graceful, opening door that draws all readers in, and I thought that was well done."
508,0,"Of course, that would be wasted if the rest of the book weren't top-notch -- but The Battle of Chibi is excellent and reads like the very best combination of old world fairy tales and historical adventure stories. Anyone who remembers reading a Brothers Grimm collection knows that those tales were not the fluff conjured by the worlds ""fairy tale"" -- they were searing adventure stories and moralistic fables told in language that got straight to the action. The Battle of Chibi does the same, planting the reader firmly in the story but creating a sense of formal otherworldliness with careful use of words and pacing."
509,0,"In places, the different pieces of the work read almost like a screenplay, with conversational back-and-forth introduced with a name and a colon. In another work this might bother me, but it fit here. We are seeing action as it unfolds, and the quick exposition helped me feel the urgency."
510,0,I would recommend this work to any student of history -- Chinese or not -- but also to anyone who loves a good tactical fairy tale (I assuire you there is such a thing). Hock Tjoa brings history to life in The Battle of Chibi.
511,0,"It took me a bit to get into it, it felt a bit like when I read an ancient piece of Greek literature that has been translated... it just didn't flow for me right out of the gate. Once I was able to get the characters squared away and into the flow of the story, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it. I particularly enjoyed the intrigue and strategies employed by the different parties in the story and then I have to remind myself that this isn't entirely fiction, the battle of Chibi really took place."
512,0,"I admit that prior to reading this, I knew very little about Chinese history or culture beyond the last 50 years or so. This has definitely piqued my interest and I hope to find more about the great nation of China and how it came to become what it is."
513,0,This was a First-Reads selection from Goodreads
514,0,"The Battle of Chibi may appear at first to be a daunting read, but it is well worth the effort.  The book offers an abridged version of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  For those who are not acquainted with this revered saga, The Battle of Chibi is an excellent introduction."
515,0,"The introductory sections of the book are extremely helpful to readers who are unfamiliar with the story or the culture.  The reading advice presented here is excellent and helps to make the entire book more accessible.  The Battle of Chibi is well written, presenting not only the actions of warriors but insight into the culture and thoughts of those involved."
516,0,"This is not just a story of war.  It is a tale of honor, betrayal, strategy, heroism, love and sacrifice.  The characters are shrouded in legend and myth, but they are still intrinsically human."
517,0,"Readers who are not accustomed to this type of literature may have difficulty at first with making sense of the seemingly unending battles, beheadings, plots and characters.  In the end, persistence pays off.  The story unfolds and primary figures emerge.  To me, the story became intriguing when master strategists matched wits.  Those who enjoy tales of schemes within plots veiled in subterfuge will love this book."
518,0,A complimentary copy of this book was received in exchange for a non-reciprocal review.
519,0,"Other reviewers have discussed the plot of  ""The Battle of Chibi"" so I won't reiterate it here. There is a long introduction which references the context of the original work, translations of some terms and even suggestions on how to read the book.  This probably works better in paperback than for an e-book (I don't tend to flick back and forth when reading on Kindle) and I found myself skimming it, eager to start reading the thing itself. It was something I came back to at the end."
520,0,"Likewise, there is a translator's preamble before each part. I can see why this is necessary - the translator does not want to misrepresent the original and so needs to tell us what he omitted - nevertheless, again, I found myself coming back to it later. When the book finally started - ""This is the nature of the history of All under Heaven (China): when the empire is divided for long, it unites; when united for long, it falls apart"" - I was hooked immediately."
521,0,"The first part is the most challenging. It's not the kind of book you can (should?) read once. I did get confused between the names at times but that was just unfamiliarity. It is like reading the Iliad or Dante's 'Divine Comedy' and so needs to be read and re-read. Like those, it is also full of violence and complex plots and some beautiful visual imagery. The art historian in me longs to see this in hardback with lavish illustrations."
522,0,"I'm not qualified to comment on the accuracy of Tjoa's translation but the result is extremely readable with no affectations and a great flow, especially once the pace picks up in the second and third parts. The dialogue was also an easy read. There is a lot about strategy in the book (it is the history of a battle after all) but also about the nature of power and the way it corrupts and motivates individuals. A fascinating read that brought an epic to my attention."
523,0,very good
524,0,"light paper, but characters are not small."
525,0,"Not as advertised.  The title of the book, and the ""Look Inside"" contents show both pinyin and Chinese characters.  However, the book itself only has Chinese characters.  As a Chinese language learner, I need both.  I would not have purchased this book had I known."
526,0,Perfect book. I love the fact that is hardback and the Hanzi aren't tiny. And the book is small enough to put in my purse and I can carry it anywhere.

531,0,"Having waded through the long version I suggest this shorter, more enjoyable translation."
532,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
533,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
534,0,"The sixth part of the story builds on the fifth (of course), which was about retaliation and murder, but also about mind games and machination. This one is dominated by battle, starting out with Guan Yu's choice as an isolated warrior, fighting one one-eyed general after another, being reunited with an old ally, enjoying drinking battles with his temporary allies, kung fu practice, some idealism... Cao Cao contemplates Guan Yu's character, as Guan Yu fights for Cao Cao against Yuan Shao (temporary ally/hostage of Liu Bei) at the Battle of BaiMa. There's the strange honour of military advisors, before we get into bloody battles and fighting with Guan Yu - and it's quite bloody!! There's a push to the frontier, and we get towards... volume seven!!"
535,0,If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series. This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter. There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions. The names and places are spelled/pronounced more accurately. This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.
536,0,Best translation that I have of the series. I have 4 different ones. Very happy with this book.

539,0,"Vol. 3 provides an exciting conclusion to the preceding volumes. In Volumes 1 and 2, Zhuge Liang has masterminded, with clever maneuvers, victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities, thus vastly increasing Liu Bei’s military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces."
540,0,"Liu Bei dies in Vol. 3 leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan. Cao Cao, seeks to take advantage of Liu Bei’s death and inexperience of Liu Shan. Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shan’s kingdom from five directions. I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat. However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out. Finally after 3 days, Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liang’s hut to hear what plans he has in mind. Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks. He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes. In his fight against the Mans, after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again. This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans, each time capturing the leader and releasing him. After the seventh time, Zhuge Liang refuses to even see the leader of the Mans and has his assistant release him. At this, the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future."
541,0,"The Three Kingdoms story is truly one of the great classics of literature. This translation is easy reading. The footnotes were not only helpful, but at those special key locations in the writing, the footnotes at the bottom of the page made the flow of the story more meaningful."

543,0,good
544,0,This is a highly disappointing book.

549,0,"Having waded through the long version I suggest this shorter, more enjoyable translation."
550,0,"This book follows the same path as the first two in the series: namely, ""prince persistently pursues woman overcoming her fears."" Unfortunately, it doesn't have much of the charm of the first two books, and has a particularly unrealistic ending given the prior established beliefs of the two main characters."
551,0,"Rafe carries overbearing worry due to a traumatic event in his past that was explained in the previous book. Genesis despises being hovered over because she hates feeling controlled. These are both valid emotional responses that people might have to previous experiences, and watching them develop through their struggles could have been compelling and beautiful."
552,0,"Unfortunately, the ending jarred me out of the story completely. Rafe did something that Genesis had repeatedly and clearly told him not to, but she forgave him quickly due to the result of his actions. I don't feel as strongly about Genesis's beliefs as Genesis does, but I bristled at Rafe's choice given Genesis's previous insistence he should *not* do what he ended up doing."
553,0,"Aside from my problem with that, I also felt the side characters were forgettable compared to those in Royal Date and Royal Chase. I struggled to remember which names referred to which stereotypical small-town personalities."
554,0,"Some things I liked about this book were the gaming references and the glimpses we get into Kat and Lemon's happily-ever-afters.  I gave this book three stars because I did end up finishing the book, enjoyed those parts of it, and believe its Kindle price is very reasonable for what you get."
555,0,"It was nice to finish Genesis and Rafe's story, but it wasn't nearly as fun as Lemon and Dante.  This story needed help. This Iowan farm girl wanna be vet went out into the winter weather one too many times without appropriate winter clothing.  That didn't fit. Farm girls are practical. They find her friend's cabin at night and it doesn't have electricity but it has a refrigerator with expired eggs and condiments? That didn't fit. Most of the events in the story take place around a roof fundraiser for the church she has been attending since a young girl, but she ""prays to the vehicular god"" and thanks the ""theater gods."" That didn't fit. We don't get to really know much of Rafe's character - he is simply a man with a painful past and a broken heart who falls in love again and has lots of money to show his love.  Loved the extra characters, her aunt and friends. Got to go to Kat's wedding. We saw some of what happened on Marry Me that caused the mix up in the 2nd book. The story was okay for filling in the blanks in the series but really the story was lacking and she, like many other reviewers posted, was whiny and ridiculous for a woman who had reasons to be fearful  and should be grateful for someone's protective measures and care. I don't think she is cut out to live in Monterra so I hope they settle in Iowa and work on healing from their past hurts and don't spend all their time playing computer games. How about a story about Marco? That would be fun. And how about it be from his perspective!!!"
556,0,"In the previous book when Genesis character was introduced, she was a sweet lovable farm girl. In this book, primarily about Genesis and Rafe, all her psychopathology is revealed. She could be lovable and sympathetic at times, and a self absorbed neurotic victim of her mentally abusive childhood at others. Her lack of ability to trust anyone along with her hurt and hate of Rafe for his previous perceived “terrible lying“ had her being terrible to him despite his showing up obviously still in love with her and doing everything possible to win her forgiveness. His perceived wrongdoing seemed not as bad as she was carrying on. Her attraction and neurotic rejection of him throughout the book got a little old. Not all the book was irritating,thus the four star rating. The story was actually good. It could have been edited to shorten a little and get rid of some of the unreasonable angst. I really liked her in the previous book but this character was not as likable or fun. She had serious issues causing this however, which I presume the author was trying to portray her overcoming. I would recommend the book despite all of this, because of the good story."
557,0,"Another charming entry in Sariah Wilson's Royals of Monterra series. If you're looking for romance with heart and emotion, you can't miss this series. Royal Games follows Marry Me runner-up (or winner?) Genesis Kelly as she tries to pick up the pieces of her broken heart after the events of Royal Chase. I don't want to spoil any part of this book but I will say every time I thought I had the story all figured out, something else happened and kept me turning the pages. I'm glad this series has developed it's own Kindle World so I can keep reading more about Monterra and can't wait to see what the author writes next!"
558,0,SENSUALITY RATING: NO Profanity; NO sexual encounters

564,0,SYNOPSIS: All he did was humiliate her on that dating show. She and her Aunt are barely staying afloat. Luckily Aunt Sylvia has rented the house outback.
565,0,"WHAT I LIKED: “Personally, I think you should lower your shields and prepare to be boarded”. (NOT boarded as in sex). Love the fact that it can be considered a mature adult romance without sex and profanity."
566,0,WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: What is there not to like. I loved the book which is why I will be reading it a second time.
567,0,"OVERALL RATING: (5) stars because I read this before I read book I and as a result because of an ability for the author to make you “wish it was me” with a sigh, I will definitely read the series."
568,0,"I love Sariah Wilson!  Her books are all really good! I have read the books and listened to them as well.  Book one ""Royal Date"" and book two"" Royal Chase were my favorites in this series, But I really liked this one too!  The stories are sweet and clean without being prudish!  She definitely knows how to write an excellent romantic story, and it's funny too!!  My only complaint is that, she still hasn't made ""Royal Date into a audio version!  I am still waiting!!  All her books can be read by all  from ages 12 to 100!!"
569,0,The previous book gave so much potential for this story. Unfortunately this story was a big zero. The main character was so self centered. Yes she had a right to be upset because she believed the prince deceived her but she forgot that she had signed up for a TV show where anything could happen. The poor prince should have dumped her.
570,0,"I just started this series and it's great.  I like Sariah Wilson's writing, especially her little life tips. This book had a different feel from the first two.  I liked the first two better and the 4th novella.  Genesis' character of stubbornness and lack of common sense was a little off putting to me. It seemed too long for the storyline and more on the horror side."
571,0,"I enjoyed this book and it was a page turner for me, especially since there was some suspense thrown in, but despite Genesis' traumatic background, it was hard for me to sympathize; she was a bit too prideful for me.  Someone finally sat her down and told her what, but it was a bit farther on in the book.  Overall, it was still a fun, romantic, clean read.  This author does a good job with clever self-talk."
572,0,"I give this book 3 stars for clean writing with some passion & spark. But I had to make myself read this book in stages - It was hard to get past the incessant complaining & whining by Genesis. Here's an apologetic, handsome true gentleman that she can't forgive - and that repeats a 100 times over in this book despite her friends telling her to forgive him.  I liked book 1 & 2. Book 3 is tough for me. I had to get through it since I paid $3 for it."

578,0,Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:
579,0,"""Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
580,0,Compare this with Taylor's translation:
581,0,"""Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity."""
582,0,Or Hegel's:
583,0,"""Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce."""
584,0,"It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator."
585,0,[This review is a duplicate of the one I submitted for volume 1]
586,0,Now for the diatribe.
587,0," This is the 2nd translation I have read. For the westerner all the Chinese names can get confusing. One approach is to imagine an Asian coming to America and all your friends names are Smith, Jones, and Williams. At least I know quite a few, and they are NOT related. This translation actually has an appendix in the 2nd volume that lists all the names. REALLY HELPFUL!"
588,0,"  Personally, I started reading the 1st translation I have, (in four volumes ""not for sale in the USA"") as the tv series, Game of Thrones got into it's 2nd season. My friends, who I watch it with are fanatics about the series. makes sense it has been the #1 TV show, several years running. For me, the Three Kingdoms has been much more enjoyable. Sometimes history is just better than the the most creative fiction. Now, this is a romanticized version of a piece of early Chinese history almost 2000 years ago. Every so often, I have to remind myself that this stuff essentially did happen. There is one scene, (an event in actual history) regarding some actions by Cao Cao that is, well, still talked about today in China, and a very dark stain to Chinese history. (OK, so there are some serious stains in Scottish and western history..)"
589,0,"  As a westerner, I have to keep reminding myself that so much of what I am reading did actually happen. Even when I step away and remind myself that the author himself, (or whom this writing is  accredited to), lived centuries later. Well, the authors time is STILL over 1,000 years ago! Step away from Games of Thrones, or better, since the series has to wait for the author to catch up, use that break and read this series. Don't worry if all the names and locations appear confusing. Just read it. I read half of it over two days non-stop. (fortunately it was the weekend) and I am NOT a bookworm. It is hard to get me to sit down and read something."
590,0,"Perhaps I am praising this work too much... However, I really feel that this story is one that every westerner in the 21st century should read. It will not explain China or even Asian culture today. As it is considered one of the ""5 classics"" in Asian culture. It is Camelot on steroids. It almost puts the American Civil War to sleep, and as a proud American, I wish the story of our founding fathers could be half as exciting."
591,0,Have fun and good luck!
592,0, Don't try to read it on the bus! or during your lunch break. You might get fired for no showing up to work..
593,0,"I first encountered Moss Roberts' translation in a greatly abridged version which I took with me on my first trip to China.  It greatly increased my enjoyment of the trip.  Now Dr. Roberts has completed his translation of the whole novel.  It is much more readable than the only other complete translation in English, that of Brewitt-Taylor.  Many centuries of Chinese have used this book to gain wisdom about politics and war; I highly recommend that you take a look."

603,0,"' on the NES.  I played that game until TWO cartridges died from usage.  Later, on Playstation, I found '"
604,0,"' and noticed a lot of similar names.  I played it and it was FANTASTIC.  I thought I was fulfilled in my living of Chinese myth/history until my mother bought me this four volume set for Christmas.  I was dumbfounded and immediately tore the plastic wrapping off and started reading.  They were all there.  All my favorite characters in my favorite games were all there and now, they had depth, they were people on the page in print living out the digital approximations I had loved so much.  Watching the formation of the Kingdom of Shu lead by the virtuous Liu Bei and Guan Yu with insurmountable strategist Zhuge Liang as the Prime Minister; seeing the power-hungry Cao Cao usurping the Han Emperor's throne; the brilliant but always foiled plans of Zhou Yu to kill Zhuge Liang; this wonderful story woven through each volume is PURELY RIVETING!  Play the games!  Buy the books! Live the adventure!"
605,0,"The way to read Romance of the Three Kingdoms is to enter their medieval world and live each moment, the way you experience life. You submerge yourself in these books, and become so immersed in the finely embroidered story that you don't care whether it ever ends. Addictive - I picked it up every chance I got, and even found myself dreaming about the story. Don't try to read these books in a week or two and then move on to something else! You'll shortchange the story and yourself."
606,0,"Like many Westerners, I suppose, I had some trouble tracking all the names - there are many characters, and some characters have several unique names depending upon what's going on or who is addressing them. But as the story progresses and your familiarity grows, this becomes less of a problem. When I started I kept lists of characters and even made notes amplifying the character's identity and relationships; but this quickly became cumbersome, and in the end I found I didn't need it. You become familiar with the main characters and easily follow their vicissitudes as the story moves along. The story becomes the main thing, and it is great!"
607,0,"I was introduced to Romance of the Three Kingdoms by a Taiwanese friend, and I'll be forever grateful to him. Wonderful saga - put it on your list of must-reads!"
608,0,"This novel is a Chinese classic and their equivalent to Western tales like Macbeth. Following three great Dynasties of Shu (Liu), Wu (Sun), and Wei (Cao), the second half sets up the titular war of the Three Kingdoms and works toward the historical conclusion, all while showcasing great heroes and dastardly villains."
609,0,"It's a really long read, and there are many, many characters, each of whom may have several different names, and none of the names are easy for Westerners to remember; nevertheless, some very important mythological and historical characters permeate the majority of the book, for example Kwan Kung.  You see a statue of Kwan Kung in a lot of Chinese businesses.  He is a red-faced king who carries a long staff with a blade attached that is useful for chopping enemy heads off.  His character is prominent, and his legend is understood by the majority of Han Chinese."
610,0,"The story centers around the fall of the Han Dynasty, which is considered a ""Golden Age"" of Chinese History.  I recommend reading this, just to gain an understanding of the attitudes and point of view of most Chinese.  On the whole, most Chinese are very proud of their history, and most claim that the history is 5,000 years.  Just keep reading, even if you're confused by the names and the discontinuities; by the time you're at the end, it should begin to sink in."

612,0,"This, along with the first volume, combine to make one of the most engaging epic stories in human history.  It can be dense at times and readers may find themselves reading only one chapter at a time, most of them being only ten pages, but each chapter is a rich story in itself.  Characters appear and die rapidly so readers my find themselves, at first, going back to previous chapters to become reacquainted with some to try to understand their significance.  This quality can slow the reading process.  However, this book will provide you with years of good reading material and introduce you to great heroes and impressive strategies."

617,0,"Henry Kissinger talked about this book in his ""On China."" Explains a lot if you're trying to understand China's hard line on dissent. They seem to think any disagreement is an invitation to anarchy, and this book explains very graphically what anarchy can mean. It's a shame. But the book itself is quite interesting. Someone said the names are tough. Yes indeed."
618,0,"""Romance of the three Kingdoms"" is a great classic and I love it very much. I consider it to be even better than ""War and Peace"" of Leon Tolstoy. I admired some of the characters, but more particularly, Chuko Liang (or Zhuge Liang for his genius, loyalty and sense of humanity. I read the book twice over the last two months. However, what I disliked are some typo mistakes. Typo mistakes seem to be more frequent in ebooks than in printed books. Something must be done to correct this."
619,0,"I can't say I'm well versed in the many different translations of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, as this is the first time I'm reading the story. However, despite how old the narrative is, I find it interesting with a lot of politics and the prominent characters always looking to maneuver with and against each other. As unexpected events come up with stability in the land always teetering on the edge, alliances and rivalries can also take drastic turns. I sometimes do have to check back on the character list because of the sheer number of named characters that show up in the story, but it's not hard to follow overall."
620,0,"This is a wonderful historical novel of the three Kingdom period (end of the Han Empire) in Chinese history.  Among many things I liked about the book, is that it detailed not only individual actions (fighting) of key figures but also went into the rationale of their planning and strategy  --  and since many characters are mentioned in the story not all of the strategy had a good ending.  I especially liked they way the story ended each chapter, section with a prelude to what would happen next.  Perhaps this is due to the way the story was originally written  almost serialized.  I found the story relatively easy to read and hard to put down.  If the reader is unfamiliar with Chinese geography,following along on a map might be useful, but then this might not be needed as one could just flow with the story.  I have not read any other translations of this classic so I cannot compare to  other translations.  But I did enjoy this one and will start Vol 2 shortly  I highly recommend this story.  The ebook version was very good and the footnotes were easy to access."

A basis of the story is the chance meeting together of the three heroes Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. This happening reminds me that we come onto many good things in life by chance rather than plan. They made a sacred oath of brotherhood. Their loyalty to one another was a joy to read. Their loyalty was tested many times but it endured even in times of great challenge. Their personalities were all quite different from one another however those differences became the strength of their joining together. We all enjoy being individuals and treated as individuals but we all end up belonging to a group whether it is a formal group of some kind or a social alliance."
624,0,"I enjoyed reading about Cao Cao, the nemesis of the three heroes. Cao Cao is a powerful and cunning military leader. We learn that he had his own weaknesses and doubts. The question came to mind many times; what does one do when one has doubts and is afraid of making the wrong choice? He does what we all usually do; we seek out a friend with whom to discuss the situation. We are looking for clarity and some good advice. This is exactly what Cao Cao did and it worked to his advantage."
625,0,"Three Kingdoms opened my eyes to give me better insight into events all around me.  Perhaps the most significant episode, for me, was how Cao Cao met the challenge of Yuan Shao. Cao Cao was vastly outnumbered in the confrontation ahead. Two large armies of hundreds of thousands led by Cao Cao and Yuan Shao compete for domination of the empire. The episode in Chapter 18 is so well written that I can feel the trepidation and uncertainty that Cao Cao feels at the moment.  At this movement of Cao Cao's crisis his senior Advisor Guo Jia, comes to him to relieve him of his doubts. This explanation Guo Jia is one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  After the talk together Cao Cao's confidence is restored and he goes on to defeat Yuan Shao's army which is five times the size of is own, WOW!  There are many episodes in Three Kingdoms that stir my understanding and give me hope.  It is a welcome edition to my library."
626,0,"I have been wanting this book for a VERY long time, but never had the means to buy it when I was 10. I haven't finished the book yet, but it's a pretty good translation. The only other version I could find was the abridged version. I really like that I get to finally enjoy this book after some 10-11 years."
627,0,So happy to have them
628,0,"This new translation of the Chinese classic Three Kingdoms was awesome to read. It explained how a dedicated group of people could coalesce around an idea with the hopes of having it come true. Liu Bei was definitely an inspired leader. The people who formed his core leadership group each had outstanding traits. I understand better now how an inspired idea can collect followers to try to achieve worthy goals. I also understand better now the importance of wise advice by seeing the impact Zhuge Liang has on events. He thoughtfully considered the details of a situation and then explained to Liu Bei, his leader, how to wisely respond to it in order to achieve worthy results. But without the skillful help of Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun achieving these goals would be impossible. So. It takes three components to achieve success: the worthy idea, good strategy and skillful implementation."
629,0,"  Liu Bei has many challenges to overcome, but this combination of a goal directed idea and good strategy for implementation are the critical components for success. It is rewarding to read how people with helpful aspirations can achieve success through loyalty and dedicated efforts. Though I have only read vol. 1, and part of vol.2,  I am eager to finish reading volumes 2 and 3 to discover how all these events end."
630,0,"  I found the Chinese names to be confusing to follow, but the glossary of main characters listed in the front of the book provided easily found information to help me through the reading of this exciting story."
631,0,"  The innovative use of poetic little poems injected at critical points in the text were unusual but quite pleasing. The author of this book and its translators, Iverson and Yu Sumei, did a fine job producing an awesome book."
632,0,Really excellent translation
633,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
634,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
635,0,"Now with this, the twelfth volume, we get the aftermath of Red Cliff, when both the winner and the loser of that grand battle realise that they've both been played by the real victor, Liu Bei, who may be technically allied with Sun Quan but is still very much his own man, winning territory and growing stronger under the strategies of Zhuge Liang."
636,0,"And while there is very little to be seen of Cao Cao in this book, still it opens with him in a showdown with Guan Yu, then gets into his depression as the man who lost an army, then some episodes with his sons - who are really only seen here for the first time, but who probably become more important as the story goes on. Among the victors, more stratagems between the Liu and Sun camps, and evil cackling Doctor Evil-type laughter. Zhang Fei once again provides doofus-like comic relief (not sure I like this very much), there are brief skirmishes with minor warlords in the never-ending war, as Zhuge Liang tricks Zhou Yu one more time; comic relief as Zhou Yu has a spastic attack, a Guan Yu episode with an ageing warrior, and more nutty feudal insanity. Finally, Liu Bei marches bravely into a sure death trap, with only the ingenious plan of Zhuge Liang to save him - and it does! We also get a glimpse of Sun Quan's crazy mom, the Lady Wu. Great grandstanding - can't wait to read the next one!!"
637,0,"Wes Anderson has outdone himself with Moonrise Kingdom. I grew up in the 1960s and early 1970s, so the time frame for this film is spot-on for my childhood. The film revolves around two twelve-year-old misfits who make well organized plans to escape the regimentation and convention of home life or summer camp. One of the best aspects of the film is how the two protagonist kids, an intellectual boy and a strong-willed girl, seek to escape on their own terms together and manage their affairs with better tact than any of the adults in the film could ever do."
638,0,"The adults are comical and subdued and they are all ""broken"" in their own adult ways, but the kids come out as the headstrong types who run circles around all of their contemporaries and all of the adults as well. There is a certain ""violent"" realism woven into the story that is entirely plausible in a 1960s setting, where adolescents were basically free-range and allowed to play with explosives, BB guns, dirtbikes and bow & arrows, with an occassional pause to smoke a pipe or share a beer with the local constabulary."
639,0,"I was there and yes, it really was like that back then. Moonrise Kingdom has a definitive romantic backstory as well, which is awkwardly charming, yet quite sincere and heartfelt. I had my first kiss with a girl in the dunes at the shore in Massachusetts in the 1960s myself, so this really a sentimental reminder of a time when the world was new...and one summer seemed as long then as ten years does to me now in middle age."
640,0,"This stylistic film, filled with over the top acting talent is the most entertaining movie I've seen a long, long time. The magic is in the total lack of violence, nudity, vulgar language. I can barely recall being so compelled to watch and absorb a film in 2019 with no real ""action"". I will take my time and process the nuances that made it work, but after one watching, I can only attest to the success of plot, characters, scenery and (of course) acting. It speaks volumes that the acting entourage was attracted to this 'little movie' in the first place. This film is so unlike any genre that it defies pigeonholing. Just surprise yourself and decide to watch it. Even true rated R junkies won't be disappointed. Kudos tothe screen writer(s) on this big little gem."
641,0,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie. My brother showed it to me, and Wes Anderson in general, and I'm so glad he did. This quirky flick just gets better every time I watch it, which has been about once a year, when I find out one of my friends hasn't seen it yet. It's magic leaves my happy every single time I watch it, and I don't think that will every go away."
642,0,"I also love Wes' directorial style as well. His distinctly quirky ""Rule of Third's"" cinematography is immediately recognizable, and always serves to further his purpose of delivering a fantastically unique, engaging, and charming story."
643,0,"The acting is superb, and even the young kids did a great job. This is actually very important, as two of the young kids are the main characters, and get a large amount of screen time. It's funny to see Bruce Willis in a very submissive role, contrary to his usual macho persona. He pulls it off surprisingly well though, and delivers a surprisingly good and well fit performance. Edward Norton and Bill Murray did fantastic, as usual, and succeeded in adding to the movie's atmosphere."
644,0,"So yes, I would definitely recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of any of Wes Anderson's other films. Awesome acting, directing, cinematography, and music really make this movie the whole package."
645,0,"This movie is absolutely enchanting IF you want to reconnect with the child you were at age 12... the kid who believed all kinds of surreal things could happen, just because you wished them to happen."
646,0,"This isn't a simple, happy story. It's complex. It has some dark aspects and implications. It ends in a way that will make you say, ""Oh."""
647,0,"And then, if you're like me, you'll watch it again, a week later."
648,0,"I bought this because a friend suggested it, to get a better understanding of stereotypes and their use in stories.  This movie IS wall-to-wall stereotypes... and they're people we've all known and loved. Or hated. Or just had to stare at because they were... well, stereotypes, and you just can't get enough of that weirdness."
649,0,"This is probably a love-it-or-hate-it movie.  I loved it.  I liked it far better than Royal Tenenbaums, which had its own charm but didn't capture youthful idealism as well as this movie does."
650,0,"If you like predictable movies well-grounded in reality, run in the other direction. This isn't for you."
651,0,If you like offbeat films that require suspending disbelief -- and make that effort worthwhile -- this movie is a must-see.
652,0,"The acting is flawless. The artistic direction is a delight. The casting is perfect. The makeup and costuming... utterly eccentric and almost a parody of that era, but -- at the same time -- not too far from fact."
653,0,"There's one somewhat intimate scene that made me uncomfortable. It's not extreme. It's not total nudity or anything. I'm sure it's consistent with the rest of the film. I'm sure 12-year-olds do that sort of thing, and I'm sure it fit the writer's creative vision. It just bothered me, because the actors really _were_ 12-years-old. (I checked.)"
654,0,"But, except for that, I was absolutely enchanted by this film, and recommend it for fans of Wes Anderson's work."
655,0,"If the movie gods didn't create Wes Anderson somebody would have to.  Never in the history Of Western cinema has there been an individualist like Anderson.  His genteel rebellious streak is unlike any other.  His films feel like a parallel universe with characters much like ourselves who are slightly off kilter.  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" finds Anderson at his most romantic.  Our protagonists are Sam (Jared Gillman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) two disaffected adolescents who find each other and run away from unfeeling authority figures to explore the island terrain and their feelings for one another.  Gillman and Hayward are natural and unaffected and at their tender ages can't be faulted for not tapping into the ironies contained in Anderson and Roman Coppola's script.  The ironies, however, are not lost on the adult cast members (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, et. al.).  ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a piece with Anderson's iconoclastic body of work.  If I could give more than five stars to the film I would."
656,0,"First time I watched this movie, I didn't like it. I was around 16 or 15 years old, and the many things happening all at once went over my head. However, the second time I watched this movie, I really enjoyed it. Moonrise Kingdom only gets better with viewing. There are so many little details you can miss the first time around. There isn't a bad actor or actress in this movie and that in itself is commendable. All the many character developments occurring in this movie are perfection. I am so glad I gave this movie a second chance and am now a Wes Anderson fanatic."
657,0,"Thoroughly disgusting.  It played all the lead-in commercials without a hitch. When it got to the ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" however, it just simply refused to play it.  There was supposedly some kind of rigamarole involving a long and difficult-to-type code, but I got the same error after jumping through this hoop.  I got the impression that there was some problem about something having expired, but I don't know what that might have been.  If this is an intelligence test, I flunked it."
658,0,"This was a delightful movie in so many ways. I loved everything from the almost surreal ""colorization"" of the film quality to the quirky characters and the hilarious reminders of what life was like growing up in the 1960s.  (unsupervised childhoods, the way professions that required uniforms (""Social Services"") always included a pillbox hat, etc.)  I loved the character development and the subtle humor (references to ""Sunday-school shoes"" and ""lefty-scissors"").  The Bruce Willis character of the island policeman and the Scout Leader are both especially well developed. I enjoyed the movie so much I watched it three times.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I reserve that hallowed rating for my lifetime favorite movies, and this movie was not deep enough for that.  But this is a fun and extremely enjoyable movie -- at least for Baby Boomers like myself who enjoy remembering how our childhoods were very free in some ways -- we jumped off of roofs onto trampolines with no net and no supervision, and we never had pre-arranged ""play-dates,"" and yet we lived under the threat of things like the uniformed Miss ""Social Services,"" who loomed in the Orwellian background of Cold War childhoods.  When you watch this movie, you will both chuckle at the accurate capture of the 1960s and sigh for the loss of that world with its goofy innocence."
659,0,"Nothing striking about this movie at all. I watched it the whole way through but was ready to end it as soon as the credits. It's hard to describe it, not particularly good in any genre; drama, action, romance, coming of age, comedy, etc. Great actors heavily under utilized. Maybe if you were a teen in the sixties/seventies you could somehow identify. I would think twice before investing your time in it."
660,0,"What a great YA movie! I don't know how I missed this one when it was out in the theaters, but I sure wish I had seen Moonrise Kingdom on the big screen. This movie has it all: a superb cast, a great plot, fantastic writing and beautiful cinematography. It is whimsical, daring, touchingly sweet, and funny with a little dash of danger thrown in for flavor. A tasty treat for the eyes and the spirit. I highly recommend it as a film for all ages. I will be adding this one to my personal library."
661,0,"At $1.99, with enabled table of contents, excellent value. There are no notes nor explanatory matter. If the great number of characters is confusing you can find maps, relationship charts, and other resources at the 3Kingdoms Podcast site."
662,0,Great story. Well made book. Fast shipping. The print is tiny to the point of being too hard for these old eyes to read. Invest the extra money for a legible print size
663,0,Excellent book about the Romance warring era. Just wish the print was a little bigger. Tons of characters to keep track of too.
664,0,This edition of the Chinese classic has print that's unreadably tiny.  The print margins are nearly non-existent and the print's uneven on the pages.  I had to send it back.
665,0,good read
666,0,What else can I say?
667,0,"One word ""Epic"""
668,0,Print size so small it gave me a headache. I'm talking pocket bible size font...beware.
669,0,Exactly what i expected and arrived early.
670,0,A lot of life lessons can be learned with an open mind.
671,0,"Since I started reading Natalia Jaster's work, which was truthfully at the beginning of the year on the recommendation of a fellow reader, I have fallen deeply in love with her talent and the true craftsmanship of her stories. Every read, including this one, leaves me in tears, astonished at the characters, the world, the love, and the dedication woven into these books by a true writer. And with ""Lie,"" the same rings true again."
672,0,"Aspen is a liar, indeed. She likes to be ahead of the curve, intimidating, and will lie in exchange for for things that benefit herself (as well as others!). In the same vein, Aire, a knight, is brutally honest and holds honesty to a truly black-and-white standard. Both of them have flaws amidst their many beautiful traits, and those flaws are what make them so admirable and worthy characters to fall in love with and to watch fall in love with each other. They change each others minds, challenge each other, do things that alter their views in both good and bad ways. Never once did I not believe in them or not wish to see them succeed, because they deserve the happy ending, lies and truths and all."
673,0,"The side characters and surprise visits from characters from past books were also a delight to see. I never not love my court jester, or my Autumn princess, or their lovely emerald-eyed boy, so seeing them again as well as getting to meet a few new people was also riveting. Every character is appealing and multi-faceted and you want to take every piece of their stories and never let go."
674,0,"If I haven't mentioned already, the worldbuilding is astonishingly impeccable. This is the third book in a series, so we do understand parts of these kingdoms already, but Natalia always infuses something new into each setting and gives the reader more to understand and love about every specific part of the world. The lore, the tales, and the beautiful specifics of each land are what makes these places shine so much, and I could not enjoy it more."
675,0,"Of course, do I need to say again the writing is remarkable? Natalia has a knack for writing in the style of this time and setting, but the characters do not have interchangeable voices at all, and the way they view the world in their words is entirely up to them. The way they live and talk and think is different in every way, and Natalia doing this while keeping every other part of the story at the same exceptional level is all down to the way she writes. If she struck any deals to weave this kind of magic, I would love to know!"
676,0,"Another part to the Foolish Kingdoms series wowed me again. However, to not lie, I wasn't surprised one bit. Natalia continues to confound me with the way all of the pieces of her story stand at a subpar level, greater than any of the stories I have read in my nineteen years of life. And you could say I still have a lot of reading to do, but I wholeheartedly believe no matter the authors and the stories I read from here on, I will go back to these books and the books Natalia continues to write after Lie and know this is the work of a magical writer; these are the books I will turn to and know I strive to create even an ounce of the beauty that these books have."
677,0,"“Once upon a time, there lived a liar. In the Kingdom of Autumn, she’d been crafted from the trees and had a nut-shaped heart. She was conceited. She was mean. And yes, she told lies. A hell of a lot. Why would this girl deserve a fairytale of her own?”"
678,0,"Lie, just as it’s predecessors, was for sure one of a kind. Unlike the previous books however it had its own special and wonderfully strange kind of fairytale twist to it. Quite obviously Pinocchio being the great inspiration and main theme to the story, yet Lie’s unpredictable plot and unique messages behind it had it standing completely on its own two wooden legs. Writing and storytelling-wise, the book was excellent."
679,0,"Since I was disappointed with Dare, Lie was a wonderful redemption and continuation to the series, hooking me to the story from page one. What had me drawn to it was mostly Aspen with her deceitfulness, spunk and marionette appearance. But also Aire’s very much polar opposite truthful personality and how that played out with their first shaky meeting. The tension between them and the enemies to lovers aspect was so compelling and worked so well with their personalities as well as the development of them and the plot. Unlike Dare I actually got much stronger personal traits which made the character so much more relatable and realistic. In turn it made growth of the relationship feel more natural. All in all, it was an addictive romance as well as a thrilling read."
680,0,"Like Dare however I still feel like I missed out on key parts of the development, of Aire and Aspen getting over their differences and growing closer. It just wasn’t as apparent as it was in the previous book. While Natalia Jaster is an amazing author she has the habit to jump in time and recap the events, which isn’t necessarily or always a bad thing to do. But it has to be the right things that get recapped, like if they’re just traveling for a day or in general something uneventful. I wouldn’t like to read pages of it anyways. It is when significant and important moments to the story, in this case the progress of the relationship, gets skipped and then just mentioned as an afterthought that I feel like I missed out. If I as a reader don’t see and get to follow along as the relationship builds up then I am also not going to believe or feel like their feelings for each other are authentic. Of course, since I still managed to fall in love with both the characters and the romance it really redeemed itself in the bigger dramatic moments, especially the amazing ending to the story. It was mainly just the beginning when they started to become friends that I didn’t fully get to see."
681,0,"There was however one friendship that was developed beautifully and that was between Aspen and Nicu. I liked that Nicu, and even Briar and Poet, had bigger roles in this book than in the previous and it was interesting seeing him as a grown teenager. Nicu being so easily lovable with his overly friendly personality, struggles with his affliction and need for adventure, it felt so natural with him becoming fast friends with wild Aspen and playing a bigger part in the plot. Also, Nicu falling in love with a brooding eremite constantly giving him the cold shoulder was possibly the most heartbreaking thing for me in the story. The way things were left in Lie with him and Lyrik really amped up the excitement and expectations for the next installment. As it seems like it will take place in Winter, hopefully Jeryn and Flare might make an appearance as well."
682,0,"That Lie follows the main theme of the Pinocchio tale makes me wonder if the previous books had their own fairytale theme that I completely missed while reading. If so, the theme wasn’t as obvious as in this book. Now after, I can guess that Dare is inspired by the Little Mermaid with the mute girl loving the ocean, the prince from a distant land and him being saved from a shipwreck and later on falling in love with the girl. However if Trick has any inspiration I have difficulty seeing what it might be. Aladdin perhaps? Since she is the princess and he the “street rat” growing in power and in the end rising to equal rights as the princess. That is the only tale I can think of even remotely close. However I might just be reading too much into it and the only fairytale book is Liar. I guess the next book will disclose that for me. After this amazing story, I can’t wait to read Dream!"
683,0,"I lived for Aspen and Aire, they were such a good example of enemies to lovers, and each were unique in the badassness, (is that even a word?), with Aspen being strong and cool and likable with her sarcasm and flirtations, while Aire was noble, chivalrous, honest, and cute. Punk and Nicu was a bonus-I loved the way Nicu expresses himself and how others are able to discern his words. He stole my heart in between Aspen and Aire's story. Of course, there are cameos in the form of Briar, Poet, and Nicu, which is always a favorite."
684,0,"There were so many emotions going through me as I read about Aspen and Aire's story. Not only was it character driven, there were also moments where a lot of important matters were discussed about the going ons of the Kingdoms and their Seasons. But overall, their story was a fairytale that turned out to be true in both its honesty and lies, and how the two can be intermingled to create and restore life."
685,0,"Words cannot describe how beautiful Aspen's story was, the friendships she made, how she fell in love, how she moved forward and strived for her dream job of designing and building weapons, and how she accepted her mother's illness of her mind, and in the way she finally became comfortable in her woodskin; how Aire finally was able to admit his belief in fairytales, in being truthful to himself, about that one lie he told, and how important his friendships are."
686,0,"I feel like this was her best work yet, the emotions, the storytelling, the descriptions of Autumn, the lyrical prose of how each character spoke, and thought, in their own way. I am so ready for Dream-to read about Nicu and Lyrik. It was enlightening reading about them in Lie and I know I'm going to love them in next book, hopefully with more insight into the rogue potioner and his belief about being a villain. Plus we'll finally get to read about Nicu and his beautiful mind and thoughts and his happy ending."
687,0,Something to look forward to: the appearance of all past characters. Natalie Jaster does not disappoint!
688,0,"I wasn't quite taken by this third book of the series. I found myself a bit at odds with a knight falling for a wooden girl. In this book fantasy was given a whole new way , in which wishes and myth were actually true and all. A girl having an acorn heart. I loved the fairy tale about the three acorns, it added a sense of mystery to the story. The knight representing realism. I loved the differences in the way if thinking and the speech of the two contrasting personas, the Knights speech that of poetry and valiant honour , and the girl of brash defiance and an air of  carelessness, again the characterisation is very well portrayed. I feel like the author wanted to try and breach through the realism to favour more fantasy , but in my opinion , it was a breach too far and I didn't quite enjoy the story as well as I should have. that being said the love making scenes were something , how a man can have sex with a wooden girl is beyond me but I appreciated Aire's stamina. In those brief scenes I saw them as a normal couple and it was quite good I have to admit."
689,0,"But the best part of the story for me was that of NICU and his newfound interest in the potioneer. It showed his pure of heart , his goodness more in this book than in the other two and the fact that he was growing up and becoming more than just a born fool , simpleton. I found myself more intrigued by their relationship than that of Aire and Aspen, and was thrilled that there would be a story of their own in the fourth book released tomorrow, what joy!  With regards to the story of Aspen and Aire, it was an interesting one and shows that there should be no barriers in whom we choose to love, but I found that it strayed from the purpose of the two other books , in advancing the acceptance of fools in the kingdoms. It's a good read nonetheless and I feel it is necessary for the follow up and last book of the series and the story of Nicu.  All in all i found that the book strayed from the main plot of what the two previous books in the series had hinted in favour of focusing on the couple themselves, which to me  just renders a story less meaningful."
690,0,"Like all her previous works, Natalia weaves a multi layered story of fantasy and romance.  She is truly a gifted author and story teller.  If you have liked any of her other books, you will love Lie!  The landscape she paints with her words had me wishing I could jump into the book and live in Mista (and maybe find a knight of my own).  I liked that there was a little more MA material in this book compared to the other books in this series or the Selfish Myths series.  I highly recommend this book and the author.  Definitely worth the time and money.  You won't be disappointed!"
691,0,"Yet another wonderful addition to Natalia’s Foolish Kingdoms series! I’d been looking forward to this book ever since she announced it and reading it was a thrill! I absolutely loved meeting the new characters Aire and Aspen AND reading more about characters from the past books. (Regarding this I believe it’s definitely best to start with the first book, Trick, so that you’re familiar with these characters!)"
692,0,"The book takes place in the Autumn kingdom. We’d learned a little about this kingdom in Trick (which primarily took place in the Spring kingdom) so learning more about it was so interesting and wonderful. I loved the fall-like setting so much, especially because it’s my favorite season!"
693,0,"What I loved most about the book was being able to relate closely to the main character Aspen’s inner struggles. By the end of the book, we’re taught a lesson about embracing and loving ourselves which is a lesson I always need to be refreshed on and I’m so thankful to Natalia for this. I always adore the fantasy romance in her books so very much, but she also teaches us so many important lessons and this is the reason I’ll always be a reader of hers."
694,0,Another reason I loved the book was that I had so much fun seeing a character from Trick (who was just a child then) grown up! The next book in her series (book 4) will have him as one of the main characters as well which I’m greatly looking forward to.
695,0,A lovely read and I absolutely can’t wait to see what Natalia writes next!
696,0,"I loved Trick, so after liking-but-not-loving Dare, I was a little bit afraid what to expect from this part of the series. To be frank, Natalia did it again. She got my attention, brought the fireworks of emotions, crushed my heart and then restored it :)"
697,0,"Since the beginning, there are so many things happening. Aspen knows what she wants and she does not hesitate to get it. Which is consistent through the story. Aire does the same thing even though they spent so much time as opponents. Their relationship started as a shy getting closer to each other and ended in the hurricane of emotions and feelings which was so good to read. Both of them are mature, rational and bold which make their relationship much more enjoyable."
698,0,"But even more thank the romance, I was amazed by the arc of Aspen's perception of self. I believe that the story about her getting comfortable in her own skin (litterally) is the most important message from this book. Because often, it really is not the bullied one who need fixing."
699,0,"What needs to be mentioned is the beginning of Nicu's and Lyrik's story, which I am so looking to read ASAP."

701,0,Only a third of the way in but already love all characters and the writing style.
702,0,"Could not be more genuinely in love with this series or her writing style if I tried. One of my favorites, can't wait for her new stuff!"
703,0,There has been an increase these days in the amount of graphic novels and shorter graphic books being published.  This 48 page graphic universe book (Guan Yu: Blood brothers to the end: a Chinese legend by Dan Jolley and Ron Randall) is one of several graphic publications put out by Lerner Publishing Group. I have read several of these in the past and I picked up this one on Amazon for a bargain price.
704,0,"This ancient Chinese Legend book covers the following material:  The legend begins, blood brothers united, a new allegiance, the journey home, blood brothers once more, the path to enlightenment, glossary and pronunciation guide, and further reading and websites."
705,0,The story is beautifully told and the illustrations are fantastic.  Even though these books are aimed for children I think adults would also enjoy reading this graphic story.
706,0," If you are a fan of graphic novels you should check out this book.  My only complaint is the short length of this volume (48 pages), but it is still a good read."
707,0,"Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Pro-Systems Combatives Vol. 1,2.)"
708,0,"A Pole Arm is slightly heavier than a sword, but it requires more concentration to keep opponents from closing in. Guan Yu was skilled in using his cutting pole arm and was well known for it. There should be more films showing Guan Yu fighting, instead a red figure in the background. This book shows younger readers that no matter how outnumbered you are, if you develop an effective skill than you can survive with determination. Over history wars were not sword skirmishes, there were spearmen and polearms. The God of Martial Arts is a great motivation for any Martial Artist."
709,0,"Well done art with an interesting text, this little graphic book brings the story of one of the patron immortals of Chinese history to life. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Chinese history, but who may want a colorful, easy read."
710,0,My Fiance loves eastern history and being that Guan Yu is a Chinese legend he was thrilled when I purchased this for his birthday.
711,0,"Volume eight is a very unusual tale, in that it follows the sworn three brothers throughout nearly all of the tale as they bring the war to Cao Cao, but it also shows Cao Cao as a loving father who horses around with elephants and shows compassion to his enemies."
712,0,"The tale starts off with the fate of Yuan Shao, who was doomed to die a stupid death after mishandling his position as the only warlord in China in a position to challenge Cao Cao, who philosophises at his enemy's grave (later, a contrasting scene at Guo Jia's grave shows Cao Cao mourning the loss of a man he truly could trust). Yuan Shao's tale is ultimately not very interesting, as he suffers the fate of so many ill-fated warlords through Three Kingdoms (and through all of Chinese history), but you do get a sense that the characters in Three Kingdoms are consolidating and the tale is simplifying somewhat."
713,0,"Liu Bei has a rare episode of failure, attempting to strategise against Cao Cao, who outwits him tremendously. There's a great scene of the two military leaders meeting for a parley in the no-mans-land between their two armies that's a fascinating piece of drama, before Liu Bei is sent running, once again a leader without an army as Cao Cao mops up in the north. There's a short scene with Sun Quan, now fully bearded, establishing his rule in the south as a benevolent leader who listens to his advisors, before we see Liu Bei and his brothers struggle in the realm of Liu Biao (kind of a silly episode, although there is one really great episode showing the three brothers training with each other, bare-backed with rippling muscles, and also the famous horse Dilu's 30 metre leap during Liu Bei's escape from treachery). When Liu Bei enlists Xu Shu, his fortunes as a general change, and while Cao Cao's cowardly machinations mean that he doesn't last long Xu Shu comes through for Liu Bei, as role is ultimately to be nothing more than a means of introducing one of the great characters of Chinese literature - Zhuge Liang! Can't wait for Volume 09!!"
714,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
715,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
716,0,"The second part starts off with another list of characters, focussing on the aftermath of the collapse of the coalition of 18 states opposing Dong Yuan and the late Han empire. The tale starts with rural battles between bitter rivals, the emergence of Zhao Yun as a mighty warrior, and the downfall of Sun Jian in a bloody ambush. Yuck! It's interesting that our heroes - the brothers three of Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - are hardly seen in this book, other than to comment on events elsewhere while playing a chess game. Not Zhang Fei's style, to be sure. The tale of ""The Family Plot"", which dominates this book by running just over 100 pages, shows how a man sacrificed the ""honour"" of his daughter in order to restore justice through the downfall of two monstrous warriors. It's a fascinating tale that is too good to NOT be true!"
717,0,"This instalment of the tale is much gorier and sexier than the first tale, also showing the suffering peasants of China toiling under the tyranny of Dong Zhuo, who is portrayed as a bloated lech. It's pretty creepy at times too... The book ends with an essay on the nature of literary tragedy, comparing the final rivalry between Dong Yuan and Lu Bu over the love of Chan Diao with the tale of Othello. It's a decent essay on the perils of emotion and bloody rivalry."
718,0,Disclaimer: I recieved an ARC via Netgalley.
719,0,"One always worries about the second installment of anything. True, there is the Empire Strikes Back., but in many cases there is always a subtle, if not huge, let down. The second installment somehow seems weaker; it isn't bad, but just not as good as the first."
720,0," So it is with great pleasure, I can say that is NOT true of this second installment of the Legend of Three Kingdoms. The only thing wrong with this graphic novel presentation of the famed story is that you want more at the end. You go, ""What? No! Can't be over yet!""."
721,0," This, undoubtably, is a good thing for the creative and production team behind the series. It is made easier on the reader that the ending is not a cliffhanger. You just don't want the story to end."
722,0, This is better than Volume 1.
723,0," It should be noted that there is violence and sex in this book. While neither is graphic, there is no nudity or copious amounts of blood, neither is coded. There are strategically placed towels and sheets, though."
724,0," The focus of this superb installment is the plot to bring down Yhao Dung. This plot is set in place by Councilor Weng and makes use of his daughter Diao Chan, who transcends the stereotype of the sex using woman. What Diao Chan desires is far from money and fame, and has more to do with honor and survival. She is a Chinese Judith. The conversation between father and daughter, where he asks her to do the unthinkable, is beautifully drawn and written. Diao Chan is anything but a passive character and shines as a heroine who does not use a sword, but is no less heroic because of that."
725,0," The love triangle between Diao Chan Yhao Dung, and Bu Yu is starkly played out among the jockeying for power that occurs in the kingdoms. The story is told and illustrated with such pathos that it resembles a movie. The closing panels of the volume focus on this love triangle and leave the reader grasping."
726,0," The first half of the volume focuses more on battle and introducing new characters that will play larger roles later in the story. The theme that haunts the love triangle, filial and family loyalty and ties, is also present and does an excellent job of connecting the two stories."
727,0," Everything that made the first volume so good is still present - the beautiful art work, character listing, historical notes and explanation (I loved the bit about the chain scheme), as well as little extra pages depicting artwork or knowledge. These pages are placed better than they were in the ARC of the first volume."
728,0," In many ways, however, this volume would undoubtably work better in an school setting than the first. The introduction of Diao Chan will not leave female students with a focus, a female character who has strength of character and who can do what men can not. The love triangle can be used in several different ways, besides the historical context. While the book itself makes a connection to Shakespeare's Othello, a teacher can also use Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing, making Shakespeare easier or more accessible for students who couldn't care less. If the first volume has the extras that allows the reader to tie the story to modern situations, the second volume allows the reader to connect great works of literature. Additionally, the love triangle can be used to discuss questions of morality and loyalty. Furthermore, the volume (and this is true of the first as well) can be used to get students who love movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger interested in literature as well as history."
729,0," As a final word, I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It is wonderful to see this work come out in America and the publisher should be applauded for doing so."
730,0,Reason for Reading: Next in the series.
731,0,"While I thought the first volume most suited to this age group due to intellectual maturity, this second volume does become more graphic in all senses: violence, and sexuality both implied and visual.  The first book was almost a whirlwind as we got introduced to the myriad characters and intricate plot, this book does continue in that vein but also settles down into various story arcs.  Several dealing with the battles and politics but a major one in which the volume is named after ""The Family Plot"" where a plot to bring down a ruthless tyrant is put into action.  The first female character is introduced via this plot and several other characters are explored more fully.  I enjoyed this volume even more than the first one, but still do contend that it is not an easy read.  I read the book in one sitting and recommend that as the best way to read it.  Putting the book down halfway through and picking up again could prove disorienting as there really is a huge cast present here.  It is hard to keep track of everyone but as the story progresses the characters are becoming more familiar.  I could see myself re-reading this series after I'd been through it once.  I didn't mention in my first review but this is based on a Chinese epic written 600 years ago called ""The Romance of the Three Kingdoms""."
732,0,"Ii agree with the previous reviewer -- this book is for more mature audiences than the first volume.  The author has again distilled a long  volume of Chinese history into a comic book of political intrigue and sexual tension.  I don't want to give away the plot. The series of books about the Three Kingdoms is the most popular book set in China.  The art conveys the action and the suspense. The words cut to the core of the story, which is what fascinated me. I'm glad somebody took the trouble to make these cultural stories available and enjoyable."
733,0,A unique gift request for a Dynasty Warriors fan.  The perfect gift!
734,0,"If you want to have a better understanding of this period which is a tangle of broken alliances and power struggles with a massive body count, this graphic series is a good way to start. However I think you need to come at this with an already-established idea of the great heroes Zhuge Liang,  Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.  I recommend watching the original Hong Kong release version of Red Cliff before engaging with these books."
735,0,"Well-drawn lovely compositions, by the way. Art students could do worse than having a good look-through for ideas of how to engage a viewer graphically, while still giving a feeling of antiquity appropriate in theme."
736,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."

Oh well..."
738,0,"Now with this, the ninth volume, which is close to the halfway point with the 20-volume Tale of the Three Kingdoms, the action finally starts rolling, and Liu Bei enlists the help of military advisor Zhuge Liang, thereby taking charge of his (and China's) destiny, and also ceasing to be the perpetual loser. In the opening chapters, we see the emergence of another tyrant as Sun Quan goes on a rampage of battle; we also see Liu Bei meet Zhuge Liang, and they have many polite conversations, while the latter teaches the former that individual considerations should not come before a great cause... and Zhang Fei and Guan Yu provide mood and comic relief. Zhuge Liang then puts his ""Three Kingdoms"" plan into place, destroying first 100,000 of Cao Cao's men, then 500,000 in elaborate traps that show the enemy no mercy; this quickly earns him the respect of the once-suspicious Guan Yu and Zhang Fei."
739,0,There's also a pitiful scene of Cao Cao burning with fury over a family tragedy.
740,0,"The story development is a wee bit confusing here the way it handles mention of the fate of Liu Biao (friend? enemy? both?), who's never seen by the way - a strange piece of planning by the authors - but the book is a marvel of storytelling, tension building, and epic bloodbaths. The art is superb, and really comes alive in the battle scenes with the intricate armour, the magnificent helmets, and the grisly weapons!!"
741,0,"The Battle of Chibi (Red Cliffs) is an ancient and complex Chinese saga superbly edited and translated by author/scholar Hock Tjoa.  As a scholarly work, it is an absolute triumph.  The source materials seem very elaborate and daunting, and the author should be lauded for presenting this material to modern western audiences."
742,0,"With that being said, however, although the book is a stupendous cultural achievement, actually reading it is a bit polarizing.  Many reviewers have praised the characters and storylines, but I found it all to be just too much.  It's not just that there are an astounding amount of characters -- the issue is none of them are really developed enough to distinguish them or care about them.  This is obviously no fault of Mr. Tjoa; this is often the nature of ancient sagas, no matter which culture they originate from."
743,0,"Mr. Tjoa himself is quite fascinating, however, and I would love to see him devote his efforts to a literary work that could really showcase his academic and literary talents.  In addition to Chibi, he has also written classic Chinese plays, and modern-day Asian spymaster tales.  I, however, would love to see him write a full-length novel in the style and setting of Chibi, but with well-developed characters and storylines:  Warriors, emperors, princesses, eunuchs, bandits, peasants, and philosophers.  Perhaps a ""Game of Thrones"" meets ""The Last Airbender.""  Considering his talent, I'll bet it would be awesome."
744,0,It’s quite apparent to me that the author of this translation of ancient Chinese history/fiction is a scholar who seeks to preserve his culture in current vernacular. The story is reminiscent of early narratives of many cultures. Warring tribes as well as battles for control of land and power are rich treasures of antiquity.
745,0,"That being said, the collection of stories from the Battle of Chibi was quite difficult for me to read and comprehend. The author of this translation, Hock Tjoa, tries to create context with early maps and interspersed commentary. He presents a glossary of characters prior to reading this example of Chinese literature, yet I struggled to understand the importance of each. Who were the good guys and who were the bad ones? The prologue helps to set the story within the historical context of three separate kingdoms in ancient China. “When the Empire is divided for long, it unites; when united for long, it falls apart; this is the nature of the history of All under Heaven [China].”"
746,0,"I applaud Tjoa’s tenacity for extending the readership of these ancient Chinese stories by translating them into English. Unfortunately, general readers will be as lost as I was trying to understand the political background of ancient Chinese society. For example, I knew nothing about the eunuchs who played a huge role in royal courts, even into modern history. I needed to research that element to understand the historical context. I would suggest adding the information within the prologue."
747,0,"Just as ancient biblical texts have been translated into common vernacular, there is great merit in the preservation of The Battle of Chibi as an example of ancient Asian literature. On the negative side, the stories had no meaning for me. The characters were not developed by the author of this translation. Instead, Tjoa attempted to make them come to life by having the dialog more current. Nonetheless, within two pages we have Xun You, Xun Yu, and Xu You. Terribly confusing. In fact, there were so many characters, I was literally lost."
748,0,"Since the author notes that other English translations of the Battle of Chibi exist, though not in more current vernacular, perhaps he would consider writing a historical novel based on Chibi, not a translation. There could be a main character, clearly identified, with a frame of reference for the story. A flowing narrative with a well-developed point of view could make this Chinese history come alive. I imagine Tjoa’s work would merit 5 stars in the eyes of a Chinese scholar. For me, it was a struggle."
749,0,"Though The Battle of Chibi is an abridged version of the historical Chinese novel: “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” it is still undeniably a daunting read, mainly because it leaves out many human elements of the saga, focusing principally on the battle. For example, it introduces the three main protagonists, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei at the point where they take their famous oath, swearing to die together. The original saga—The Romance—on the other hand, gives more insight into the life story of these men as well as indications on how they first met, offering the reader, not only clarity but interest as well. Knowledge of the back-story—of Liu Bei as an impoverished young man who made a living selling straw sandals and weaving grass mats, or of Zhang Fei as a wine-seller and butcher, seems at once more appealing than the intimidating story of war. But, of course, the battles are an integral part of The Romance and focusing on them does not in any way dilute the power of the work. It, in fact, offers an accessible and stirring glimpse into the dramatic lives of feudal lords who held sway in China in an era sheathed in myth, magic, and deadly power struggles. It is undeniably a fascinating epic."
750,0,"This is clearly a work filled with the devotion of an author who wants to preserve and honor the history of his people. I am filled with admiration for the sheer amount of work that went into the translation process itself, and have nothing but respect for the effort that went into making this a story more palatable for those of us who know next to nothing about ancient China."
751,0,"That said, I found reading this a daunting task, especially as the author deemed it necessary to include a section on how to read the book in the first place. I'm grateful that I was able to read on my computer rather than an e-reader, which made it somewhat easier to return to those reading instructions and character lists as I read. I often found myself confused by the many similar character names, and had to set myself straight."
752,0,"Sadly, my biggest takeaway after reading was that mankind's ""all for me and nothing for you"" attitudes in relation to land, resources and riches is clearly universal and seemingly eternal. In spite of all the many changes that have taken place over the centuries, the desire to go to war with our fellow man remains unchanged, and our justifications for launching such campaigns still speak to the underlying greed of the rich older men who care little for the younger men they send to their deaths."
753,0,"A challenging read, but well worth the effort."
754,0,"This book comprises a selection of chapters translated and annotated from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, an 800,000 word 14th century novel set in a turbulent period of Chinese history more than a thousand years earlier. Part historical, part mythological, it is one of the classics of Chinese Literature. And like most literary classics, not exactly a quick or easy read."
755,0,"While the author's introduction and comments do much to place the story in context, the first chapters of the book, summing up the events leading up to the actual Battle of Chibi, or Red Cliffs, is such a litany of minor events and characters that it almost reads like a telephone book. A bit of a cold shower to start off with, but once you get into it, or past it, it all comes nicely together, picking up pace and gaining color to reveal a fascinating, epic world of intrigue, strategy and treachery akin to that of Game of Thrones."
756,0,"Epic, strategic, fiery and brutal battles with hundreds of thousands of men, intrigue, betrayal after betrayal, loyalty and beheading, and fascinating Chinese history, philosophy and culture is presented in this saga translated by historian and scholar on Chinese thought, Hock Tjoa. Clearly, it took an epic amount of energy and time to complete the task of translating the selected chapters from The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. A scholarly accomplishment no doubt a highly valuable contribution to the understanding of Chinese history and political thought."
757,0,I had very little Chinese history awareness so each thread of this scholarly achievement was new information.
758,0,"Reading was difficult due to the nature of the story: many characters I couldn't keep straight, who did what when and how it related to previous loyalty and betrayal was a effort I didn't have the stamina to keep up with. It's a difficult read but I finished it, a chapter or two at a time, with a gritted determination. It was well worth the time and energy spent to get an overall picture of the end of the Han Dynasty."
759,0,5 Stars
760,0,"Magically enchanting, and wonderfully addicting, THE BITTER KINGDOM delivers an explosive conclusion that will leave you breathless and yearning for more!!! From it's rich lure of fantasy blend, and it's thickened plot, to it's breathtakingly hypnotic romance, and non-stop action and adventure, and magical background that solidifies this series to it's fullest. THE BITTER KINGDOM was one hell of a finale that I am utterly satisfied with, but drastically needing more..."
761,0,"I am speechless after reading THE BITTER KINGDOM. I feel like my feelings are all jumbled and no words I can form will do it nearly any justice. There are no words to express the full depth and love I have for this book--no series. This series is one of those series that will stay with me for a very long time. And I'm saddened to see it all end, as I still want more from these characters and this world. But either way I still really enjoyed the way this series ended, even though at the same time it felt incomplete. But it doesn't really matter because it was an EPIC journey though it all!!"
762,0,"Like I said above, this book ended great, it was absolutely wonderful. But, I still did feel that their were still too many unanswered questions that were left open at the close of this series. And it kept picking at me long after this book was over. It felt like it wasn't the end of the series and that another book would follow. It just didn't wrap up as good as I hoped it would have. I would of liked to see how some of the side charters ended up after the battle was all said and done. I guess I just wanted more from the epilogue, and to see how things fared after the main plot was played out. BUT nevertheless, it still delivered in more ways then one, and has stole my heart and branded it's world forever in my soul."
763,0,"The writing was as elegant and suspenseful as ever, and the characters had so much growth and development that it was heart-warming to see the strength they were able to pull from each other through all their struggles. I loved watching them through each book as they went through and endured each obstacles that tested them to their fullest, and were able to find the strength and endurance at each turn to overcome their predicaments and become stronger and more determined then ever!"
764,0,THE PLOT
765,0,"Elisa has failed her kingdom, and now she's paying the price for that failure..."
766,0,"Betrayed by supposed allies in her most trusted circle, Elisa is now hunted, a wanted fugitive in her own kingdom. Hiding amongst her own people, trying to blend in and cope with the capture of the captain of her guard and the man she's slowly came to love. Elisa can't possibly imagine it getting anymore complicated, but boy is she wrong. It's about to become a sandstorm of madness..."
767,0,ELISA HAS 5 GOALS:
768,0,"1-Free her beloved Hector before he makes to Invierne in enemy hands, and surfers a fate unimaginable. 2-Safely enter the City of Invierne and stop the impending war that's on their way to her kingdoms doorstep. 3-Meet with the neighboring kingdoms Queens, her sister Alodia, and her good friend Cosmé, to forge a health alliance and hopefully join their kingdoms. 4-Stop civil war from tearing her kingdom apart at the hands of the fellow Quorum Lord Eduardo, before it's to late. 5-And finally―finally, restore her kingdom back to it's once glory, or better yet, make it even more remarkable then it ever was."
769,0,"Simple right? Ooh no, far from it!! Elisa's journey will be horrendous as it takes her all across neighboring kingdoms and back, fighting enemy's and supposed allies at every turn. But Elisa is steadfast on completing her 5 goals before all is lost to them all. She is their Queen, and their born savior, and she will not give up until all is saved, until her kingdom is back in good graces, no matter the sacrifices, she will endure them all..."
770,0,"THE BITTER KINGDOM went above and beyond the limits I expected, and though it didn't end the way I thought, it still rocked this series to the very core and has me eagerly anticipating more from Rae Carson. Because this woman is brilliant, and truly has the special gift of creating magical worlds that not only draws the reader in, but also invest them into her world and wonderfully characters, that satisfies in more ways then one."
771,0,"Overall, THE BITTER KINGDOM is a thrilling conclusion that is not to be missed. This whole series is wonderful and will go down as one of my favorite series of all time!! If you're looking for an epic adventure though enemy lands, and a battle to save a kingdom with magical elements, and a bitter sweet romance, then THE BITTER KINGDOM and the complete series is definitely for you!!"
772,0,Like maybe from a critical stand point this should be a slight bit lower but gosh I have so much love for this book and this series and these characters that I don't even care. 😭
773,0,"I have not fallen in love with characters like this and been so I vested in relationships since reading Throne of Glass and Six of Crows. I'm acting like I read these years ago but you know, what ever. 😂 Like a fat, person of color main character who learns how to become the most confident and badass woman out there?? I just have no words. Thinking about Elisa makes me feel so empowered."
774,0,There's so many more amazing quotes and scenes in this last installment. So many precious and beautiful moments between Elisa and Hector and even more incredible character development. Like that scene of there first time just had me crying.
775,0,"""It wasn't perfection, but it was perfect."""
776,0,This isn't even a coherent review but basically all you need to know is that this is an absolutely incredible series that everyone needs to read This is definitely going on the list of favorite series of mine. 😍
777,0,"While 4 stars is not a bad rating, The Bitter Kingdom fell short in a series that, for me, showed amazing promise - I gave a 6-star rating to The Crown of Embers, the second novel of this trilogy!"
778,0,"I was disappointed with how Rae Carson wrapped up the story about Elisa, her Godstone and her act of service. It felt anti-climatic to me. After reading the second novel, I thought I had a grasp on the concept of a Godstone, but now I'm not so sure. Is a Godstone truly a direct link between the bearer and God or is it something else entirely?"
779,0,"Carson did such a wonderful job of building up Elisa and Hector's relationship in the first two novels. It was the perfect combination of angsty and sweet. But, I felt the magic between our couple was lost in The Bitter Kingdom."
780,0,"I'm longing for more story about Rosario and Red, Storm and Alodia, Mara and Belen, even the future of Joya D'Arena, but the series is now complete. I truly hope Rae Carson will consider writing more story in Fire and Thorns world. She is a fantastic storyteller! Overall, I still believe The Bitter Kingdom deserves a 4-star rating, with the overall series rating being 5 stars!"
781,0,Being the last installment of the trilogy I was pleasantly surprised by how much it grew as a book from its predecessors. I really enjoyed this one more then I thought I would. It improved in places where I needed it to improve for me and also was a lot more entertaining to me. I also would like to point out that I loved how this book added a dual perspective but only when it was necessary. We got so much more magic system and world building in this book. I am just sad that it came so late and at the end of the series because had it came before I might have loved this series more but alas that is not the case. I did feel the ending was a little anticlimactic as is somewhat usual in YA finales but it still wrapped up nicely. I highly enjoyed my time with this series and am finally glad I got around to it.

786,0,"Even though I feel my words will be woefully inadequate, it is really important for me to be able to review The Bitter Kingdom. I don’t want any other fellow fantasy fans out there missing out on such an incredible trilogy any longer (which is what I did for years until just last month). The Bitter Kingdom is one of the best series enders I’ve read - rich in details, satisfactory conclusions per plot point… and still contains a thrilling adventure, treasured friendships and a swoony romance."
787,0,"If The Girl of Fire and Thorns lit my fangirl fire, and The Crown of Embers coaxed roaring flames out of it, then The Bitter Kingdom kept it steadily aflame. It tells the next part of Elisa’s story, which is full of higher stakes, unexpected sacrifices and dangerous exploits. Like its predecessors, the novel is well-written, with just the right amount of flourish to provide lush details even while remaining fairly easy to read."
788,0,"The Bitter Kingdom takes everything readers have come to know about Elisa (including her destiny and duty), these characters, this world and the raging conflict in it and brings us to its fantastic conclusion. Though I might have been able to guess how things would go, it was easy to decide to simply just enjoy the ride and go where the words would take me. Carson’s writing is so easy to get lost in – and doing that was probably the reason my overall experience of the series was fantastic."
789,0,"Elisa is a complete badass in The Bitter Kingdom. Gone is the girl from the very beginning of The Girl of Fire and Thorns, the one filled with uncertainty and fear, and found comfort in food and the familiar. A warrior, a queen, a mage – this is the girl that has taken her place. It was hard not to break out into applause and hollers of appreciation while witnessing all her deeds. It was a treat to see her in command, of herself and her kingdom. Carson allowed Elisa’s character development to unfold organically throughout the series, and it culminates here beautifully."
790,0,"Elisa’s relationships (especially with her little crew of Mara, Belen, Storm and eventually, Mula/Red and Hector) are a key element of The Bitter Kingdom. It’s simply nice to see Elisa have friends she can rely on, who will tease her, advise her, protect her and stand by her. The clear affection and regard they have for one another is admirable and enviable."
791,0,"Of course, there’s something more than friendship between Elisa and Hector. By the end of The Crown of Embers, these two are head over heels in love, but kept apart by duty, propriety and actual physical separation. I am seriously in love with this romance! Carson knows exactly how to make it work, taking a two steps forward-one step back approach that leaves readers wanting more. Readers should prepare for a whole lot of swooning, as the romance is entirely too epic to avoid doing so!"
792,0,"But Fire and Thorns is about Elisa’s journey. I loved that it was her individual journey that truly mattered. It was never buried or forgotten, and wound up being the primary aspect that carried the story along."
793,0,"The Bitter Kingdom is a beautiful ending to the epic Fire and Thorns series. The story that began with Elisa’s wedding in The Girl of Fire and Thorns comes full circle here, with a satisfying, believable conclusion. It was an incredible journey to be a part of! Rae Carson has written a series that I will definitely be revisiting in the future. If you have yet to read this series, please take my word for it and JUST DO IT."
794,0,"This is the third and concluding volume of the series. Elisa is on the run and is facing the threat from her enemies who have captured her love, Hector. In order to save him and her kingdom, which is now under the threat of civil war, Elisa embarks on a dangerous and challenging journey, making bold alliances along the way and traveling both over land and underground through a series of mines holding deadly traps at each turn. The almost non-stop adventures lead to a brave and bold conclusion where Elisa uses her strategic mind to come up with an intriguing plan to save the kingdom. Along the way, we learn more about the Godstone and the history behind the people of her world."
795,0,"This was quite an enjoyable trilogy. I liked the adventure in this volume, the nonstop action and the introduction of the character Red, who deserves her own book series. I also like the inversion on the usual hero-rescues princess trope, with the princess in the beginning setting out to rescue her romantic interest. I wasn't thrilled with some of the revelations about the Inviernos, which seemed to come from out of nowhere and without enough build-up. Also, I thought the message at the end about learning to love oneself was laid on a little too thick, to the point of being eyeroll-inducing. It's possible, I think, to have a strong theme in a story without throwing it in our faces. Up until now the series did an excellent job of it. Ms. Carson should trust her narrative to get the point across on its own, without having to scream it from the mountaintops in the last chapter."
796,0,"The Bitter Kingdom for me ended up being more about finishing out the series, rather than me being pulled into the story. There were aspects to this final installment that I enjoyed: the friendships, seeing Elisa become a stronger character (in some respects), Storms addition to the group, and Mula, who added a bit of humor to the story at times. The romance between Elisa and Hector builds up in this one. While at points I enjoyed their romance, in other respects it was also a bit disappointing too."
797,0,"Large parts of the story are of course their hardships through enemy territory and such. I will admit I ended up skim reading through some sections of the novel. The story was still well written, it just did not grab me like the first one or even the second."
798,0,"*Note, while the novel remains a clean read. There are a few fade to black scenes."
799,0,"From desert to snow, Rae Carson has delivered an epic fantasy series that encompasses dangerous terrain and is fully satisfying, gripping, and thrilling. Appropriately named THE BITTER KINGDOM on many levels, picking up the final novel for the first time left a bitter taste in my mouth. This book broke my heart--in all the best ways. Over the course of the series, Rae Carson has gotten better and better. Each book exceeds the last. Even her e-novellas have depth and merit, well worth your $2.99. Carson has become one of my favorite high fantasy authors, and I'm already anticipating a new series by her. I'm devastated that the series has ended; it's like I've lost a cherished best friend. The series ends on a high note, and if you haven't yet made the leap, I envy you. Seriously, I envy you. You get to read these amazing books for the first time. One of my friends is reading the first book now on my suggestion, and it makes me so envious. I seriously want to cry every time I think about the fact that I'm finished this series. I feel so barren without it in my life! Thank goodness for the ability to re-read!"

802,0,.***
803,0,"Elisa has come so far and changed  a great deal over the course of the series. She's gone from being a whiny princess who sits around and eats non-stop without a care in the world to a young queen willing to risk everything in order to protect her loved ones and an entire kingdom. With the way THE CROWN OF EMBERS ended, I thought THE BITTER KINGDOM would revolve around the rescue of Hector, and while it begins that way, it's not the true purpose of the novel. Characters continue to work together and aid one another in ways that make me admire Carson even more, and the plot is richer and fuller than I imagined it could be. Everything comes full circle, and while new questions are raised in unexpected ways (I would love a companion series centuries in the future that pick up on the fruition of Elisa's Purpose), nothing is left hanging. The resolutions are satisfying and make me both happy and sad--happy because the book is just so good, and sad because...this journey is over. I still can't quite comprehend that; I'm pretty sure I'm in withdrawal. I already need to re-read this series and have been sitting on the final novella!"
804,0,"I don't want to give anything about the plot away, but it amazes me to see the way Carson opens up new characters. We explore villains and their motivations. We learn a bit about their culture. We have gone from steaming hot deserts to frigid, snow-capped mountains. The journey is more sparse this time around; you can tell in the lack of food description alone! Elisa and company have endured so much over the course of the series, and will suffer through even more before encountering destiny."
805,0,"Carson is incredibly gifted at writing. Small decisions become monumental and make you stop and savor/reflect, only to be followed by moments of humor to make the emotions dissipate. She is queen at playing with reader emotions. Elisa is such a strong female role model, and it's great to see a girl kicking butt and saving the guy for once--especially when he's okay with that! So refreshing. And Hector...how I adore Hector. He has to be a favorite of mine. When I re-read THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS before reading THE CROWN OF EMBERS for the first time, I saw a hint of something, but I wasn't sure until later in TCOE...much as I was rooting for it to be the case. After everything Elisa has endured, she deserves happiness and true love, and Hector is just right for her. I've even fallen in love with secondary characters from the series, however, and it's like they've all become close friends. You understand what makes them tick and what they care about. This deepens upon reading the e-novellas, though they're not necessary to the main plot. I can't say it enough: Carson is superb at character development."
806,0,"There's a lot of gushing in this review, and little summary, since there are so many spoilers by now. I apologize. I love this series so much, though, and if you haven't read it or finished (Hey, I wasn't in True Love on my first go-round, either! Just in Serious Like) yet, you owe it to yourself to give the Fire and Thorns Trilogy a genuine chance...especially since you have a chance to win the whole series below!"
807,0,"Elisa's reign as queen has never been easy, but in the final installment of the Girl of Fire and Thorns saga, Rae Carson gives us and ending so epic, it will give you shivers. The Bitter Kingdom is a conclusion like no other."
808,0,"Elisa has suffered through being married off to a man she had never met for political reasons, the loss of a husband she had just come to appreciate, being kidnapped, the loss of a man she loved, assassination attempts, and now attacks upon her kingdom. As a foreign-born queen, Elisa must do more to prove to her people she can protect them. As the Invierno sorcerers finish their attack on her city, she escapes, but not before her beloved guard Hector is kidnapped. Determined to find Hector, Elisa and a trusted group of loyal friends head off through the mountains and desert to find the man she loves."
809,0,"Along the way, Elisa realizes she has tapped into the power of her Godstone through the discovery of a source of power. Storm, the Invierno traitor turned loyal subject, works with Elisa to hone her powers. While she knew she had grown since her original marriage as a plump, bored princess, she had no idea just how much has truly grown. As one of the most powerful animagus to ever live, she knows she now has the power to protect her kingdom from the Inviernos and their magic. But it is her fearless nature and determination to protect her people that is the true force to be reckoned with. People may underestimate Elisa, but that is just one more thing in her favor, because if they underestimate her, they will never see it coming when she follows through on all her plans."
810,0,"I have absolutely loved this story from the first book to the last. Carson wove a web of stories that were so intricate and so engaging that you simply couldn't stop reading. There was no sophomore slump throughout the series, and the ending? Don't expect any downtime here! This story was action-packed from the first page to the last. With the exception of about 5 pages at the end to give us an epilogue with information on how life turned out for everyone, this book just didn't release its vice grip on you until you were done! If you are the kind of reader who needs to be engaged from start to finish, this really is the series for you. Not a dull moment to be found!"
811,0,"I have said this before, with Carson's previous books, but I will say it again. There is something so incredible about Elisa that she really has to be one of my absolute favorite heroines in all the books I have read. She is strong, she won't be broken, she doesn't scare easily, and if she does, she uses that fear to take back what is hers and find a way to resolve any solution with as few casualties as possible. I love the fact that her body is constantly discussed as well. You would think this should be something inconsequential, but there is something so important about a heroine who lived a life of pleasure, who didn't fit the ""princess mold"" in terms of her body type, and who still rose to the occasion and defied all expectations. And even when she slimmed down, she was still built differently. People commented on it and made snide comments, but Elisa used their derision to catch them off guard. It was fabulous! But it was her ability to negotiate and see the big picture that made Elisa so successful and made me truly love her."
812,0,"The supporting characters are just as dynamic as Elisa. Mula, the slave girl they rescue on their travels, is so funny, loyal, and appreciative that you can't help but love her! She drives them all nuts with her candidness, but that is what I love the most about her! She just tells it like it is! Then there is Storm, the Invierno traitor who became Elisa's ambassador and finally her loyal subject. Inviernos are described as a primitive race who were there before Elisa's ancestors ""descended"" and began taking over. Unfortunately, there isn't much information past this tidbit, but the Inviernos clearly despise anyone who isn't their kind. They also can't lie. In fact, trying to get a straight answer reminds me of trying to get a straight answer out of a faerie, as described in other novels. They can't lie, but they are more than happy to trick, mislead, and deceive. That is Storm. And his people. So his blunt honesty can be humorous or unwelcomed, but it is who Storm is! And while he drives everyone else nuts, Elisa is protective over the strange man. And his loyalty to her is matched only by her other traveling companions."
813,0,"This was just such a special story full of magic, sorcerers, strong ladies, and the lands they will die to protect. If you have any student who loves a little fantasy and needs a fabulous story to keep them interested, look no further. You have found it. As a conclusion, this was a fabulous way to wrap up a story I have followed since the first book was released. I loved it so much, I can't even find the right words to describe it! I think the beautiful complexity matched with the simplistic strength of the story will appeal to young adults as well as adult readers. And Ms. Carson? You had better be working on something new, because I cannot wait too long without something more from you!"
814,0,"Prior to reading this book the Three Kingdoms of Ancient China: The History and Legacy of the Reunification of China after the Han Dynasty, I knew very little about the ancient history of China.  The book lists a website that can be used to translate Chinese words.  The ancient Chinese had a concept called Mandate of Heaven which is similar to the Divine Rights of Kings concept that was used in Europe.  The Mandate of Heaven in theory was given from heaven to a leader who would act in benevolence and righteousness for the Chinese people, and could be lost by the Emperor who did not display these characteristics.  The book describes in a concise and brief manner the fall of the Han Dynasty, the fighting that gave rise to the three kingdoms, and the final battles that led to the unification of China.  The book has an extensive bibliography.  I recommend the book to anyone who is interested in ancient Chinese history."
815,0,I believe the info is accurate but the style prevents reader involvement. Still looking for a good history of China.
816,0,The author does a good job of explaining this period in Chinese history.  However you tend to get lost with all the different Chinese names.
817,0,I AM INTERESTED IN STUDYING ABOUT ANCIENT CHINA AND THIS PIECE I DOWNLOADED IS VERY INFORMATIVE.
818,0,Tiny pamphlet.  There are definitely inconsistencies and inaccuracies when compared to other sources.
819,0,"A good brief overview of the fall of the Han Dynasty through the Three Kingdoms era, and reunification. It is an essay so it is expectedly short and does not go into much detail on any of the political figures of the time."
820,0,This book is short and well articulated. Good for history lovers who are pretty busy with other fields. Thank you.
821,0,I  want to thank every one and i am doing  better and please never give up my friends without your suppourt i thank you please keep on the protest and i love life and i am not quiting.Your all aswome.

822,0,"The author does a great job of explaining the Three Kingdoms Period as an overview, and there are good references, but I was hoping for more detail. The extensive use of the actual Chinese names was a nice touch too, along with the explanations of how they work."
823,0,Somehow I never felt as if I really was getting into this. It read more like a. Senior class project than a historical account of what must have been an important and formative part of China.
824,0,"Since I started reading Natalia Jaster's work, which was truthfully at the beginning of the year on the recommendation of a fellow reader, I have fallen deeply in love with her talent and the true craftsmanship of her stories. Every read, including this one, leaves me in tears, astonished at the characters, the world, the love, and the dedication woven into these books by a true writer. And with ""Lie,"" the same rings true again."
825,0,"Aspen is a liar, indeed. She likes to be ahead of the curve, intimidating, and will lie in exchange for for things that benefit herself (as well as others!). In the same vein, Aire, a knight, is brutally honest and holds honesty to a truly black-and-white standard. Both of them have flaws amidst their many beautiful traits, and those flaws are what make them so admirable and worthy characters to fall in love with and to watch fall in love with each other. They change each others minds, challenge each other, do things that alter their views in both good and bad ways. Never once did I not believe in them or not wish to see them succeed, because they deserve the happy ending, lies and truths and all."
826,0,"The side characters and surprise visits from characters from past books were also a delight to see. I never not love my court jester, or my Autumn princess, or their lovely emerald-eyed boy, so seeing them again as well as getting to meet a few new people was also riveting. Every character is appealing and multi-faceted and you want to take every piece of their stories and never let go."
827,0,"If I haven't mentioned already, the worldbuilding is astonishingly impeccable. This is the third book in a series, so we do understand parts of these kingdoms already, but Natalia always infuses something new into each setting and gives the reader more to understand and love about every specific part of the world. The lore, the tales, and the beautiful specifics of each land are what makes these places shine so much, and I could not enjoy it more."
828,0,"Of course, do I need to say again the writing is remarkable? Natalia has a knack for writing in the style of this time and setting, but the characters do not have interchangeable voices at all, and the way they view the world in their words is entirely up to them. The way they live and talk and think is different in every way, and Natalia doing this while keeping every other part of the story at the same exceptional level is all down to the way she writes. If she struck any deals to weave this kind of magic, I would love to know!"
829,0,"Another part to the Foolish Kingdoms series wowed me again. However, to not lie, I wasn't surprised one bit. Natalia continues to confound me with the way all of the pieces of her story stand at a subpar level, greater than any of the stories I have read in my nineteen years of life. And you could say I still have a lot of reading to do, but I wholeheartedly believe no matter the authors and the stories I read from here on, I will go back to these books and the books Natalia continues to write after Lie and know this is the work of a magical writer; these are the books I will turn to and know I strive to create even an ounce of the beauty that these books have."
830,0,"“Once upon a time, there lived a liar. In the Kingdom of Autumn, she’d been crafted from the trees and had a nut-shaped heart. She was conceited. She was mean. And yes, she told lies. A hell of a lot. Why would this girl deserve a fairytale of her own?”"
831,0,"Lie, just as it’s predecessors, was for sure one of a kind. Unlike the previous books however it had its own special and wonderfully strange kind of fairytale twist to it. Quite obviously Pinocchio being the great inspiration and main theme to the story, yet Lie’s unpredictable plot and unique messages behind it had it standing completely on its own two wooden legs. Writing and storytelling-wise, the book was excellent."
832,0,"Since I was disappointed with Dare, Lie was a wonderful redemption and continuation to the series, hooking me to the story from page one. What had me drawn to it was mostly Aspen with her deceitfulness, spunk and marionette appearance. But also Aire’s very much polar opposite truthful personality and how that played out with their first shaky meeting. The tension between them and the enemies to lovers aspect was so compelling and worked so well with their personalities as well as the development of them and the plot. Unlike Dare I actually got much stronger personal traits which made the character so much more relatable and realistic. In turn it made growth of the relationship feel more natural. All in all, it was an addictive romance as well as a thrilling read."
833,0,"Like Dare however I still feel like I missed out on key parts of the development, of Aire and Aspen getting over their differences and growing closer. It just wasn’t as apparent as it was in the previous book. While Natalia Jaster is an amazing author she has the habit to jump in time and recap the events, which isn’t necessarily or always a bad thing to do. But it has to be the right things that get recapped, like if they’re just traveling for a day or in general something uneventful. I wouldn’t like to read pages of it anyways. It is when significant and important moments to the story, in this case the progress of the relationship, gets skipped and then just mentioned as an afterthought that I feel like I missed out. If I as a reader don’t see and get to follow along as the relationship builds up then I am also not going to believe or feel like their feelings for each other are authentic. Of course, since I still managed to fall in love with both the characters and the romance it really redeemed itself in the bigger dramatic moments, especially the amazing ending to the story. It was mainly just the beginning when they started to become friends that I didn’t fully get to see."
834,0,"There was however one friendship that was developed beautifully and that was between Aspen and Nicu. I liked that Nicu, and even Briar and Poet, had bigger roles in this book than in the previous and it was interesting seeing him as a grown teenager. Nicu being so easily lovable with his overly friendly personality, struggles with his affliction and need for adventure, it felt so natural with him becoming fast friends with wild Aspen and playing a bigger part in the plot. Also, Nicu falling in love with a brooding eremite constantly giving him the cold shoulder was possibly the most heartbreaking thing for me in the story. The way things were left in Lie with him and Lyrik really amped up the excitement and expectations for the next installment. As it seems like it will take place in Winter, hopefully Jeryn and Flare might make an appearance as well."
835,0,"That Lie follows the main theme of the Pinocchio tale makes me wonder if the previous books had their own fairytale theme that I completely missed while reading. If so, the theme wasn’t as obvious as in this book. Now after, I can guess that Dare is inspired by the Little Mermaid with the mute girl loving the ocean, the prince from a distant land and him being saved from a shipwreck and later on falling in love with the girl. However if Trick has any inspiration I have difficulty seeing what it might be. Aladdin perhaps? Since she is the princess and he the “street rat” growing in power and in the end rising to equal rights as the princess. That is the only tale I can think of even remotely close. However I might just be reading too much into it and the only fairytale book is Liar. I guess the next book will disclose that for me. After this amazing story, I can’t wait to read Dream!"
836,0,"I lived for Aspen and Aire, they were such a good example of enemies to lovers, and each were unique in the badassness, (is that even a word?), with Aspen being strong and cool and likable with her sarcasm and flirtations, while Aire was noble, chivalrous, honest, and cute. Punk and Nicu was a bonus-I loved the way Nicu expresses himself and how others are able to discern his words. He stole my heart in between Aspen and Aire's story. Of course, there are cameos in the form of Briar, Poet, and Nicu, which is always a favorite."
837,0,"There were so many emotions going through me as I read about Aspen and Aire's story. Not only was it character driven, there were also moments where a lot of important matters were discussed about the going ons of the Kingdoms and their Seasons. But overall, their story was a fairytale that turned out to be true in both its honesty and lies, and how the two can be intermingled to create and restore life."
838,0,"Words cannot describe how beautiful Aspen's story was, the friendships she made, how she fell in love, how she moved forward and strived for her dream job of designing and building weapons, and how she accepted her mother's illness of her mind, and in the way she finally became comfortable in her woodskin; how Aire finally was able to admit his belief in fairytales, in being truthful to himself, about that one lie he told, and how important his friendships are."
839,0,"I feel like this was her best work yet, the emotions, the storytelling, the descriptions of Autumn, the lyrical prose of how each character spoke, and thought, in their own way. I am so ready for Dream-to read about Nicu and Lyrik. It was enlightening reading about them in Lie and I know I'm going to love them in next book, hopefully with more insight into the rogue potioner and his belief about being a villain. Plus we'll finally get to read about Nicu and his beautiful mind and thoughts and his happy ending."
840,0,Something to look forward to: the appearance of all past characters. Natalie Jaster does not disappoint!
841,0,"I wasn't quite taken by this third book of the series. I found myself a bit at odds with a knight falling for a wooden girl. In this book fantasy was given a whole new way , in which wishes and myth were actually true and all. A girl having an acorn heart. I loved the fairy tale about the three acorns, it added a sense of mystery to the story. The knight representing realism. I loved the differences in the way if thinking and the speech of the two contrasting personas, the Knights speech that of poetry and valiant honour , and the girl of brash defiance and an air of  carelessness, again the characterisation is very well portrayed. I feel like the author wanted to try and breach through the realism to favour more fantasy , but in my opinion , it was a breach too far and I didn't quite enjoy the story as well as I should have. that being said the love making scenes were something , how a man can have sex with a wooden girl is beyond me but I appreciated Aire's stamina. In those brief scenes I saw them as a normal couple and it was quite good I have to admit."
842,0,"But the best part of the story for me was that of NICU and his newfound interest in the potioneer. It showed his pure of heart , his goodness more in this book than in the other two and the fact that he was growing up and becoming more than just a born fool , simpleton. I found myself more intrigued by their relationship than that of Aire and Aspen, and was thrilled that there would be a story of their own in the fourth book released tomorrow, what joy!  With regards to the story of Aspen and Aire, it was an interesting one and shows that there should be no barriers in whom we choose to love, but I found that it strayed from the purpose of the two other books , in advancing the acceptance of fools in the kingdoms. It's a good read nonetheless and I feel it is necessary for the follow up and last book of the series and the story of Nicu.  All in all i found that the book strayed from the main plot of what the two previous books in the series had hinted in favour of focusing on the couple themselves, which to me  just renders a story less meaningful."
843,0,"Like all her previous works, Natalia weaves a multi layered story of fantasy and romance.  She is truly a gifted author and story teller.  If you have liked any of her other books, you will love Lie!  The landscape she paints with her words had me wishing I could jump into the book and live in Mista (and maybe find a knight of my own).  I liked that there was a little more MA material in this book compared to the other books in this series or the Selfish Myths series.  I highly recommend this book and the author.  Definitely worth the time and money.  You won't be disappointed!"
844,0,"Yet another wonderful addition to Natalia’s Foolish Kingdoms series! I’d been looking forward to this book ever since she announced it and reading it was a thrill! I absolutely loved meeting the new characters Aire and Aspen AND reading more about characters from the past books. (Regarding this I believe it’s definitely best to start with the first book, Trick, so that you’re familiar with these characters!)"
845,0,"The book takes place in the Autumn kingdom. We’d learned a little about this kingdom in Trick (which primarily took place in the Spring kingdom) so learning more about it was so interesting and wonderful. I loved the fall-like setting so much, especially because it’s my favorite season!"
846,0,"What I loved most about the book was being able to relate closely to the main character Aspen’s inner struggles. By the end of the book, we’re taught a lesson about embracing and loving ourselves which is a lesson I always need to be refreshed on and I’m so thankful to Natalia for this. I always adore the fantasy romance in her books so very much, but she also teaches us so many important lessons and this is the reason I’ll always be a reader of hers."
847,0,Another reason I loved the book was that I had so much fun seeing a character from Trick (who was just a child then) grown up! The next book in her series (book 4) will have him as one of the main characters as well which I’m greatly looking forward to.
848,0,A lovely read and I absolutely can’t wait to see what Natalia writes next!
849,0,"I loved Trick, so after liking-but-not-loving Dare, I was a little bit afraid what to expect from this part of the series. To be frank, Natalia did it again. She got my attention, brought the fireworks of emotions, crushed my heart and then restored it :)"
850,0,"Since the beginning, there are so many things happening. Aspen knows what she wants and she does not hesitate to get it. Which is consistent through the story. Aire does the same thing even though they spent so much time as opponents. Their relationship started as a shy getting closer to each other and ended in the hurricane of emotions and feelings which was so good to read. Both of them are mature, rational and bold which make their relationship much more enjoyable."
851,0,"But even more thank the romance, I was amazed by the arc of Aspen's perception of self. I believe that the story about her getting comfortable in her own skin (litterally) is the most important message from this book. Because often, it really is not the bullied one who need fixing."
852,0,"What needs to be mentioned is the beginning of Nicu's and Lyrik's story, which I am so looking to read ASAP."
853,0,"Natalia does it again! Love, love, love her writing style and world building. I will gobble up everything she publishes!"
854,0,Only a third of the way in but already love all characters and the writing style.
855,0,"Could not be more genuinely in love with this series or her writing style if I tried. One of my favorites, can't wait for her new stuff!"
856,0,If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series. This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter. There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions. The names and places are spelled/pronounced more accurately. This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.
857,0,Best translation that I have of the series. I have 4 different ones. Very happy with this book.
858,0,My 15-year old LOVES this book. He's read it twice already.
859,0,It's great as long you don't steal it!
860,0,"Vol. 3 provides an exciting conclusion to the preceding volumes. In Volumes 1 and 2, Zhuge Liang has masterminded, with clever maneuvers, victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities, thus vastly increasing Liu Bei’s military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces."
861,0,"Liu Bei dies in Vol. 3 leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan. Cao Cao, seeks to take advantage of Liu Bei’s death and inexperience of Liu Shan. Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shan’s kingdom from five directions. I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat. However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out. Finally after 3 days, Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liang’s hut to hear what plans he has in mind. Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks. He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes. In his fight against the Mans, after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again. This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans, each time capturing the leader and releasing him. After the seventh time, Zhuge Liang refuses to even see the leader of the Mans and has his assistant release him. At this, the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future."
862,0,"The Three Kingdoms story is truly one of the great classics of literature. This translation is easy reading. The footnotes were not only helpful, but at those special key locations in the writing, the footnotes at the bottom of the page made the flow of the story more meaningful."
863,0,Excellent books to read
864,0,good
865,0,This is a highly disappointing book.
866,0,"It makes the great classic available to readers who are more comfortable witj English, yet retains the feel of the original language. This is especially evident in the translated poems."
867,0,"This is the first half of C. H. Brewitt-Taylor's translation of the 14th-century Chinese classic. I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Roberts's translation. While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions, as a reader I considerably prefer Roberts's translation, primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes. Lacking the information in those endnotes, I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative."
868,0,"The one respect in which I prefer the Brewitt-Taylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another. He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does, which may appeal to some readers (though not me) as suggesting the story's venerable age. The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago, and is based on historical events from about 200 A.D."
869,0,"I note that I am finding it helpful to read each chapter twice, once in each translation. The book has a vast cast of characters, none of whom I was familiar with before, but many of whom would have been known to its original audience. Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasn't trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported. (Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names.)"
870,0,I will postpone comment on the book's quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end.
871,0,"P.S. My rating of 3 out of 5 stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story, and I may well end up giving the Roberts's translation a higher rating."
872,0,"This review doesn't really concern the story - Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature, and it'd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review. It's amazing, and exciting, and definitely read it if you can."
873,0,"What I will review - and what I have significant problems with - is the Tuttle edition for Kindle. I can't really speak on the printed edition, but a lot of my criticisms, I suspect, will apply."
874,0,"Firstly, there are a ton of typos. I'm averaging one per page now. Things like:"
875,0,"""Today her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends/ and her influence is enormous."""
876,0,"It seems petty, and normally I'd ignore it, but it gets on your nerves after a while."
877,0,"The fact that there are so many of these errors speaks to a lack of proper editing, I think, which leads to my next point: a lot of the prose is pretty bad, stylistically. It varies from place to place, but it's at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment. More than once I've had to stop and ask myself: ""who is the subject of this sentence?"" or even ""who is the direct object?"" which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about."
878,0,"The register of the translation changes as well - one second a character might be speaking in a very formal, periphrastic ""bureaucratese"" and then end the sentence with something jarringly vernacular. It seems like a minor issue, but things like that can confuse characterization and are just generally poor usage. More generally, the dialogue is stilted and artificial: ""The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien Shih."" Stylistically, it's an awkward sentence - why phrase it like that? It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker - which is fine, as long as there's a strong editor to clean things up, which seems to be lacking here."
879,0,"The next one is a bit of a preference thing, I'll admit: usage of Wade-Giles. When I was learning Chinese, Pinyin was the ONLY romanization used. Say what you want about the merits of Wade-Giles, but Pinyin is what people are going to generally be familiar with today. So when I read through this and see (I think) Kongsun Tsan, I have to stop and translate it in my head: ""Kongsun Tsan? Is that Gongsun Zan?"" (I've read this book - different editions - a number of times, so I'm familiar with the characters. Otherwise I'd honestly be lost.)"
880,0,"Now I hear what you're saying: ""but what about the people that don't know anything about China? Wade-Giles would be so much simpler. That way people aren't pronouncing Cao as Cow!"""
881,0,"There are a number of other issues in the book that make that a questionable argument. Firstly, WG has its issues here as well - Kongsun's ""Kong"" is not pronounced as in King Kong. There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes, once more to do with consnant voicing, but someone utterly unfamiliar with Chinese would be tripped up by it just as well as they would with Pinyin's c equalling (roughly) [ts]. But this is a huge digression."
882,0,"For the uninitiated there are somewhat larger issues. Most notably, the usage of ranks. The book is a bit ambivalent about this: when we first meet Guangong, the book notes that this signifies he is Lord Guan (as gong = lord). Other times, however, the book introduces ranks (Chinese ranks) without a single explanation of what it is: ""so-and-so was at the time occupying the rank of ssu-tu."" Well, ok - what is this rank? Where is it on the hierarchy? Is it low or high?"
883,0,"For the record, ssu-tu is situ or ""Minister of Education."" It's worth noting that the edition didn't even get this right: ssu-tu would be si-du in Pinyin, as tu=du and t'u=tu. If you care, the apostrophe (as far as I know) here represents differentiation in consnant voicing."
884,0,"Why was it necessary to tell us this character was ""ssu-tu"" without explaining WHAT it was? (The Minister of Education, an important post, which would help explain why this person was in a position to plan a coup.) The book does this a number of times, which makes the sections revolving around court intrigue especially painful, as we're told person x had position a, person y had position b and person x had position c, with the positions generally not elaborated upon."
885,0,"The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesn't: ""Commissioner X told Y Ssu-tu [note the Chinese syntax for titles] such-and-such."" Some titles are fully translated and some aren't - so we're hearing Empress Ling tell Tung T'ai-hou (=Dowager Empress) something. It then switches. Overall, INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court."
886,0,"So we have a confused usage of ranks (some English, some Chinese, some mixed) which at times have no explanation as to what they are or where they are in the court hierarchy. At best, we've been briefed once, and it's NEVER touched again. Why couldn't the translator simply render ""ssu-tu"" as Minister of Education throughout the book? What would it have taken away that was more important than clarity?"
887,0,"This is a great work of literature, and this edition's introduction is a great transition for the Western reader into the right mindset."
888,0,My mother in law recommended this book. Its a great read to learn Chinese history from a fictional book.
889,0,I would definitely have enjoyed it more if I could follow the characters. The characters are numerous and have VERY complicated and some similar names.
890,0,This is a must for those who enjoy history. It's a Chinese classic and I've read
891,0,both books. This is reading I would recommend.
892,0,"Bought this for my son. He loves Chinese history. This book is actually historical fiction. My son says it is great. In fact, he has read it many times."
893,0,great
894,0,"I brought it for my husband, it was recommended by a friend. He loves it. He read  Clavell's Shogun and this book is similar to it."
895,0,AMAZING. From start to finish i couldn't put down these books. I recommend to anyone! Great gift for any reader
896,0,"So much has been revealed here in this book. We learn more about the prophecy, more about Thalia and her role, the Fae prophecy, and Rafe. There didn’t seem to be a whole lot of action in this book, mostly just in-law drama, and information."
897,0,"Thalia is still badass and confident as ever. I like how the author is keeping the character’s personalities consistent in each book. I’ve read series where it seems like the author struggles to maintain the same portrayal of the characters, but that isn’t any issue here. We see Thalia and her 3 mates grow and explore their relationship further. She has now claimed all 3... which basically means she has boinked with all 3 now."
898,0,Another great addition to the series and I’m eager to start the next book to find out what other drama Thalia and her 3 mates can find.
899,0,"Triad is book 3 of the TriAlpha series and the continuity issues I saw in book 2 don't seem to have bled over to this book; it's a much smoother read. There is a bit of redundancy in the words used (such as intrinsic), but I may be noticing repeats as I'm reading the books back-to-back. I like where the storyline is heading, but another annoying cliffhanger. Off to book 4..."
900,0,Blast you Serena! That ending... You know what I'm talking about. (insert stink eye) But man oh man what a ride! I love Thalia and her attitude for the crap that keeps coming her way shows how amazing she is. Her mates keep her ground which is how it should be. I seriously cannot wait for the next book. Please don't keep us waiting!
901,0,"These books just keep getting better and better. I love these characters so much. I feel mental and emotionally involved with them to a point I have to remind myself they aren't real. You just want to sit down and devour all these books because they are so amazing,"
902,0,This series just keeps getting better with each book I read in it. I love everything about it. I would definitely recommend this book.
903,0,I can’t explain how much I loved this book the more I learn the more I need to know what happens next so glad I don’t have to wait to find out
904,0,Twists and turns in plot? Check. Wonderfully complex characters? Check. A stunning world that sucks you in? Check. What more could you want?
905,0,Love this series. It’s seriously hot.
906,0,"In previous books, there was a cliffhanger of course. It's pretty typical in a series. This one though? Harsh, Serena, harsh."
907,0,"Ok so on to the actual review and less of my foot stomping. So the writing over the series has improved in flow. That or I've gotten used to it. Not sure. It has never been bad, just not the flow I prefer. So either it has changed somewhat closer to my preferred style or as I said, I've simply gotten more used to it. The dialogue has always been well done. The editing is well done, as usual. I noticed no errors in spelling, grammar or continuity."
908,0,"Thalia, as always, is a BA. In this book, she has a lot of things she must adjust to. Yet, she does so with far more grace than I probably would have. I do hope she gets her ...... back though. The guys also have some issues and some big revelations to sort through."
909,0,"Overall I would recommend this book, as well as the rest of the series."
910,0,"Why is this like crack for me? For some unknown-to-me reason, I thought this was a trilogy? Maybe the triad theme? I have no idea why. But, no! Cliffhanger-city, baby, and apparently I'm the mayor. I don't know. I really hate cliffhangers, but S. A. has been so freaking faithful about getting those books out in a timely manner that I ain't even mad. I am knuckle biting. How can this be resolved? How will the big-bad get defeated? I don't want to spoil anything here in a review, but I have all the unanswered questions. Arrrgh! There were plot twists on top of plot twists in this one."
911,0,"I'm ready for Thalia to kick all the ass in book four. I NEED her to kick all the ass. She's been through enough, and I want to see her triumph in a big way. She's an awesome heroine, and I love how she's imperfectly perfect. I'll be anxiously awaiting the next book."
912,0,"The biggest tragedy of Peach Blossom comes when it ends. Western fiction, especially fantasy, has become very repetitive- generally retelling the same stories or same characters over and over again. We in the west have once again become obsessed with heroes and heroines who are flawless and idealized. Our heroes and heroines are perfect, brilliant, amazing, the best at what they do, they do no wrong-- and that makes for a very tedious, boring read."
913,0,"What made Peach blossom stand out was that it embraced a heroine who had strong points and weak points both; she could be clever and witty, she could be vain and proud. Her charm and wit sometimes saving her, and her faults often lead to disaster. In the end, the story's tragedy comes not from some generic outside villain like in contemporary western fantasy, but rather because of the faults of the two leads- Quian's pride and Yen Hua's deception."
914,0,"The story follows along a beautiful dramatic arc- moments of tragedy are painful because they are contrasted against moments of humor, moments of heartbreak are painful because they are contrasted against moments of love. Rather than following the stale pattern of contemporary western fantasy novels where a perfect, flawless hero has to go up against an evil foe only to come out victorious in the end, Peach Blossom follows a painfully human trajectory of mistakes, successes, loss and redemption. This is truly an epic adventure, and the first book that has made me cry in a long, long time."
915,0,"Through its rich world building, a westerner can catch glimpses of the rich world of Chinese folklore- rituals of Taoism, the disciplines of Buddhist teachings, and ancient Chinese myths play a large part in the story and catches the imagination and curiosity of any westerner who might not be familiar with those things."
916,0,"As I said, the tragedy in Peach Blossom comes when you realise it's over. After being given a glimpse into the remarkable world of Chinese fantasy and mythology, one yearns for more- but unfortunately, there is a great lack of Chinese fantasy novels and romances available in the western market."
917,0,"If this mere glimpse into popular Chinese literature is anything to go by, then clearly it has so many wonderful and unique and amazing qualities that most Westerners will never have access to. As western writers have made an impact on the world with stories like Harry Potter and Robin Hood that have crossed the boundaries of countries and introduced foreign nations to English folktales, imagine how far Chinese authors might go in introducing the world to China's beautiful and unique literary voice and rich literary and mythological heritage."
918,0,"There are Western writers who have tried to write stories about Chinese legends or set in China, but the written Chinese voice is inimitable. There's a cadence unique to the Mandarin writer or the Cantonese writer that, when well translated, carries across the ocean. It is a beautiful, unique voice. And if western fantasy is currently lacking in anything, it is very much lacking in beauty and uniqueness."
919,0,"The bitterness that comes at the end of Peach Blossom is not just because of the story's bittersweet end, but because we don't know how long it will be until another Chinese novel of this quality might be made available to us."
920,0,"I have read that this book is plagiarized. I have read that this book isn't even among the best Chinese fantasy has to offer. Right now, this is among the best (and only) examples of xianxia romance literature available to the English market. If there is more, better, then please- let all the happy, excited reviews show how eager we are for more Chinese fiction!"
921,0,"I have been watching the Chinese television series, Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms (Eternal Love), on Drama Fever.  The series is based upon the novel.  The Prologue of the novel is covered in the first 25 episodes of the series. Chinese screenwriters do no delete scenes.  So, if you are having difficulty following the story, I recommend you watch the series in conjunction with reading  the novel.  The story is both a romance and a fantasy. The story is a bit complex in that it jumps back and forth between the past and present and the mortal and immortal realms.  However, it unfolds a beautiful tapestry of love, betrayal, and redemption."
922,0,"As someone who has watched the drama series Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms, I enjoyed this book. I'm not sure if it's the translation or the words of the author, but it seems very simplistic, like a quick retelling of the drama series. Usually it's the book that has so much more detail, but in this case the book seemed to be lacking in detail compared to the drama series. Generally I want to read the book before seeing the movie or drama based on the book, but in this case, definitely watch the drama first. The drama follows the book almost exactly, but it is richer and beautifully detailed, while the book doesn't have much in the way of descriptions or details. All in all though, I definitely enjoyed it."
923,0,"The style of writing that Tang Qi uses took a bit of getting used to by me, but once I did I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  I, like many others, saw the drama ""10 Miles of Peach Blossoms"" and heard so much about the book from the comments that I decided to get it.  I'm glad that I did - the books always give you a much better idea as to what the characters were thinking, much better than the actors can portray.  (No slight there - those actors were fantastic!  It was just a very complicated story) There were some variations from page to screen but nothing that couldn't be reconciled.  I liked the last 100 pages best - when the very complex story came together and all of the seemingly loose ends tied together in a perfect knot.  Patience is needed - not a book to rush through.  Take your time and enjoy the fantasy!"
924,0,"This book could have been an epic telling of true love that transcends all realms. But as a plagiarized work, I found that it was an awful lazy attempt at calling it a complete work. Told completely from Bai Qians point of view was a complete rip off to the reader. I think the original author with time could have honed this piece into a classic that would transcend generations. But the rip off artist robbed them of that opportunity and took an epic story and lazily turned  out this tripe."
925,0,That is a shame. Some of the reviews stated that it would be difficult with the jumping back and forth in time and the mortal realm. It was not.
926,0,1. Bai Qain was not as unlikeable as some have stated.
927,0,"2. This work is amazingly amateurish. The screenwriters for the tv show did an infinitely better job of rounding out the story and characters. Giving them more depth, likability and character."
928,0,3. It has homosexual overtones. Also some lite sexual descriptions. Not 50 shades of grey level of descriptions though.
929,0,"4. The flaws of the book are fixed in the show but the book does give insight on passage of time, some of the more confusing parts of the translations in the show, and it is also not over complicated with several story arcs."
930,0,"I sincerely regret buying this book and also regret having to give it one star when I believe it doesn’t deserve any. I encountered this book by partly trying to read “Ten miles of peach blossom” translated in English and only found the book in Chinese with an English description about what its about. I didn’t know that this book was somewhat “Ten miles of peach blossom” I just thought it was a regular Chinese fantasy book, which is the biggest reason why I bought it, because I was interested in any good Chinese fantasy book and wanted to see what’s so great about it. I’ve barely read that far into the book not because I wasn’t liking the story, I was it’s just that I don’t always read the same book I like to read books at different times or at the same time. I’m writing this review now because I just found out about something very sad and disappointing.... A week or so ago I found the manga version of “Ten miles of peach blossom” on manga rock an app that lets you read mostly any kind of manga that you may think of from any author. I was scrolling through manga that they recommended to me based on the ones I read and liked. I was surprised and glad that I would finally get to read “Ten miles of peach blossom”, but as I read a few pages I thought I recognized the setting of the book where Susu was pregnant and about to give birth to Ye Hua’s child from the book “To the sky kingdom” I realized a little than that despite the different names of the books they are both the same story. I looked up online to see if both books were in a series and then fully realized that this definitely is “Ten miles of peach blossom” or “Eternal love” which people like to call it. I then looked to read some reviews on people’s thoughts of the book on good reads and what I read from some Chinese people made the right side of my cheek burn with embarrassment. Apparently this book is not actually written by the person Tang Qi who calls themselves the author but is a plagiarized work from another author who wrote a gay novel and other books. I felt so ashamed to have realized that I payed for a book that was funding a theft and probably hurting the original authress more wherever she may be. After reading the reviews I immediately took the book from my bookshelf and put it in my cart to sell on a sell back book website."
931,0,"Watch the series first and then read the book. The book will fill in some settle holes missed from the series. I liked I was able to imagine the additional details in the book with reference to the characters and scenery shown in the series. If you are a big fan of the main characters you will also enjoy the book more because it  focuses primarily on them, less side stories."
932,0,I first took notice of this story when I saw the television series called Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms also called Eternal love!  I of course fell in love with the character Ye Hua strong but giving of course he had his faults to! The female character Bai Qian I wasn't crazy about the woman she was absorbed in herself she couldn't see anything or anyone!  But still it was a good love story because what is love but blind? I would recommend it if you like sci-fi fantasy mixed with romance!
933,0,I first watched the series named Ten Miles Of Peach Blossoms aka: Eternal Love which was such an amazing and beautiful series that I had to read this book version. I believe the series and the book each has their own unique story telling and twice now I have cried and fell in love with the two characters. Such a touching and lovely story of love.
934,0,"What I didn't like was that we weren't able to really tell and dive into the minds of Ye Hua and Mo Yuan. What were they really thinking or feeling? I understand it was all coming from the heroine telling it, but it would have been lovely to know them both on a more deeper level. All in all it was still a good read and I truly enjoyed it!"
935,0,Falling in love with Ye Hua!
936,0,"I watched the series Ten miles of Peach blossoms in Netflix and cannot move on to Ye Hue and Qian Qian love story. I stumbled upon this book in Amazon and so glad I did. I read it word by word picturing the series I watched several times, fell in love again and cried my heart out once more. I love this story and I am so moved by the way the author presented his story in detail and the translator did an excellent job expressing emotions in words. Highly recommended to bookworms. You will not get disappointed. I promise."
937,0,"If you want to have a better understanding of this period which is a tangle of broken alliances and power struggles with a massive body count, this graphic series is a good way to start. However I think you need to come at this with an already-established idea of the great heroes Zhuge Liang,  Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.  I recommend watching the original Hong Kong release version of Red Cliff before engaging with these books."
938,0,"Well-drawn lovely compositions, by the way. Art students could do worse than having a good look-through for ideas of how to engage a viewer graphically, while still giving a feeling of antiquity appropriate in theme."
939,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
940,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
941,0,"Now with this, the ninth volume, which is close to the halfway point with the 20-volume Tale of the Three Kingdoms, the action finally starts rolling, and Liu Bei enlists the help of military advisor Zhuge Liang, thereby taking charge of his (and China's) destiny, and also ceasing to be the perpetual loser. In the opening chapters, we see the emergence of another tyrant as Sun Quan goes on a rampage of battle; we also see Liu Bei meet Zhuge Liang, and they have many polite conversations, while the latter teaches the former that individual considerations should not come before a great cause... and Zhang Fei and Guan Yu provide mood and comic relief. Zhuge Liang then puts his ""Three Kingdoms"" plan into place, destroying first 100,000 of Cao Cao's men, then 500,000 in elaborate traps that show the enemy no mercy; this quickly earns him the respect of the once-suspicious Guan Yu and Zhang Fei."
942,0,There's also a pitiful scene of Cao Cao burning with fury over a family tragedy.
943,0,"The story development is a wee bit confusing here the way it handles mention of the fate of Liu Biao (friend? enemy? both?), who's never seen by the way - a strange piece of planning by the authors - but the book is a marvel of storytelling, tension building, and epic bloodbaths. The art is superb, and really comes alive in the battle scenes with the intricate armour, the magnificent helmets, and the grisly weapons!!"
944,0,"Caution: Although it is listed as a different version of the same product, the $3.99 Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this.  The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book. I was able to return for a refund, but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe."
945,0,"I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for ""Journey to the West"" and ""Outlaws of the Marsh"".  I tried a different translation for ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well."
946,0,I prefer the Moss Robert's version because:
947,0,1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others)
948,0,"2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class"
949,0,3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version
950,0,"Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period."
951,0,"The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads."
952,0,"If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms."
953,0,"FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor."
954,0,"I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well."
955,0,"It's a challenging read for those of us who didn't grow up with these characters and stories, but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations, you can get completely absorbed in it. After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself."
956,0,"If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this. Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood. The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China, not so much in the rest of the world. If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book."
957,0,Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:
958,0,"""Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
959,0,Compare this with Taylor's translation:
960,0,"""Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity."""
961,0,Or Hegel's:
962,0,"""Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce."""
963,0,"It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator."
964,0,"In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire."
965,0,"It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the ""Three Kingdoms"" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together."
966,0,"For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience."
967,0,"The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map."
968,0,"The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's ""just"" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history."
969,0,"A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.)"
970,0,"Despite these caveats, ""Three Kingdoms"" is a work worthy of your time."
971,0,"Bought the digital version for a cheap price of $4. Story quality is fine, the technical aspects make it hard to read."
972,0,"It only shows one panel at a time, at low resolution. The Kindle PC app doesn't allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like 2"" in size. I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround. Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesn't help much either."
973,0,"The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment."
974,0,Pros:
975,0,- This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight.
976,0,"- Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang."
977,0,Cons:
978,0,The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves.
979,0,- There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before.
980,0,"- The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape."
981,0,***This review is based on a discovery made when attempting to start reading the book***
982,0,"The annotations & footnotes for Volume 1 are stored in the back of Volume 2. So if you care about any of these, which there are A TON, you need to buy the second book & lug it around with you. Which these books are not small or light by any means."
983,0,No where in the book itself or on this store page does it mention the appendix being in the other volume. I had to dig around online til i saw this briefly mentioned in a review for vol. 2
984,0,"Great book, although I should mention a complaint with Amazon for using bubble wrap. I couldn't return it because I was going overseas within a day, and it was simply too much hassle. The book arrived damaged, because bubble wrap doesn't protect the book. However, they have accepted my complaint, and agreed to a replacement (Thankyou!)"
985,0,"The book itself is a classic, and this is a good translation, although I want the one that starts: ""They say the momentum of history was ever thus: the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide."" That is surely one of the greatest openings in all of literature; this one isn't quite at that level. I think that version might be adapted from Moss Roberts (the same translator as this book), or it may be his earlier, abridged version."
986,0,"This is one of the four classical chinese novels, and if you are looking to connect with the Middle Kingdom and its past, this is a great (though rather heavy) place to start."
987,0,"The biggest tragedy of Peach Blossom comes when it ends. Western fiction, especially fantasy, has become very repetitive- generally retelling the same stories or same characters over and over again. We in the west have once again become obsessed with heroes and heroines who are flawless and idealized. Our heroes and heroines are perfect, brilliant, amazing, the best at what they do, they do no wrong-- and that makes for a very tedious, boring read."
988,0,"What made Peach blossom stand out was that it embraced a heroine who had strong points and weak points both; she could be clever and witty, she could be vain and proud. Her charm and wit sometimes saving her, and her faults often lead to disaster. In the end, the story's tragedy comes not from some generic outside villain like in contemporary western fantasy, but rather because of the faults of the two leads- Quian's pride and Yen Hua's deception."
989,0,"The story follows along a beautiful dramatic arc- moments of tragedy are painful because they are contrasted against moments of humor, moments of heartbreak are painful because they are contrasted against moments of love. Rather than following the stale pattern of contemporary western fantasy novels where a perfect, flawless hero has to go up against an evil foe only to come out victorious in the end, Peach Blossom follows a painfully human trajectory of mistakes, successes, loss and redemption. This is truly an epic adventure, and the first book that has made me cry in a long, long time."
990,0,"Through its rich world building, a westerner can catch glimpses of the rich world of Chinese folklore- rituals of Taoism, the disciplines of Buddhist teachings, and ancient Chinese myths play a large part in the story and catches the imagination and curiosity of any westerner who might not be familiar with those things."
991,0,"As I said, the tragedy in Peach Blossom comes when you realise it's over. After being given a glimpse into the remarkable world of Chinese fantasy and mythology, one yearns for more- but unfortunately, there is a great lack of Chinese fantasy novels and romances available in the western market."
992,0,"If this mere glimpse into popular Chinese literature is anything to go by, then clearly it has so many wonderful and unique and amazing qualities that most Westerners will never have access to. As western writers have made an impact on the world with stories like Harry Potter and Robin Hood that have crossed the boundaries of countries and introduced foreign nations to English folktales, imagine how far Chinese authors might go in introducing the world to China's beautiful and unique literary voice and rich literary and mythological heritage."
993,0,"There are Western writers who have tried to write stories about Chinese legends or set in China, but the written Chinese voice is inimitable. There's a cadence unique to the Mandarin writer or the Cantonese writer that, when well translated, carries across the ocean. It is a beautiful, unique voice. And if western fantasy is currently lacking in anything, it is very much lacking in beauty and uniqueness."
994,0,"The bitterness that comes at the end of Peach Blossom is not just because of the story's bittersweet end, but because we don't know how long it will be until another Chinese novel of this quality might be made available to us."
995,0,"I have read that this book is plagiarized. I have read that this book isn't even among the best Chinese fantasy has to offer. Right now, this is among the best (and only) examples of xianxia romance literature available to the English market. If there is more, better, then please- let all the happy, excited reviews show how eager we are for more Chinese fiction!"
996,0,"I have been watching the Chinese television series, Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms (Eternal Love), on Drama Fever.  The series is based upon the novel.  The Prologue of the novel is covered in the first 25 episodes of the series. Chinese screenwriters do no delete scenes.  So, if you are having difficulty following the story, I recommend you watch the series in conjunction with reading  the novel.  The story is both a romance and a fantasy. The story is a bit complex in that it jumps back and forth between the past and present and the mortal and immortal realms.  However, it unfolds a beautiful tapestry of love, betrayal, and redemption."
997,0,"As someone who has watched the drama series Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms, I enjoyed this book. I'm not sure if it's the translation or the words of the author, but it seems very simplistic, like a quick retelling of the drama series. Usually it's the book that has so much more detail, but in this case the book seemed to be lacking in detail compared to the drama series. Generally I want to read the book before seeing the movie or drama based on the book, but in this case, definitely watch the drama first. The drama follows the book almost exactly, but it is richer and beautifully detailed, while the book doesn't have much in the way of descriptions or details. All in all though, I definitely enjoyed it."
998,0,"The style of writing that Tang Qi uses took a bit of getting used to by me, but once I did I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  I, like many others, saw the drama ""10 Miles of Peach Blossoms"" and heard so much about the book from the comments that I decided to get it.  I'm glad that I did - the books always give you a much better idea as to what the characters were thinking, much better than the actors can portray.  (No slight there - those actors were fantastic!  It was just a very complicated story) There were some variations from page to screen but nothing that couldn't be reconciled.  I liked the last 100 pages best - when the very complex story came together and all of the seemingly loose ends tied together in a perfect knot.  Patience is needed - not a book to rush through.  Take your time and enjoy the fantasy!"
999,0,"This book could have been an epic telling of true love that transcends all realms. But as a plagiarized work, I found that it was an awful lazy attempt at calling it a complete work. Told completely from Bai Qians point of view was a complete rip off to the reader. I think the original author with time could have honed this piece into a classic that would transcend generations. But the rip off artist robbed them of that opportunity and took an epic story and lazily turned  out this tripe."
1000,0,That is a shame. Some of the reviews stated that it would be difficult with the jumping back and forth in time and the mortal realm. It was not.
1001,0,1. Bai Qain was not as unlikeable as some have stated.
1002,0,"2. This work is amazingly amateurish. The screenwriters for the tv show did an infinitely better job of rounding out the story and characters. Giving them more depth, likability and character."
1003,0,3. It has homosexual overtones. Also some lite sexual descriptions. Not 50 shades of grey level of descriptions though.
1004,0,"4. The flaws of the book are fixed in the show but the book does give insight on passage of time, some of the more confusing parts of the translations in the show, and it is also not over complicated with several story arcs."
1005,0,"I sincerely regret buying this book and also regret having to give it one star when I believe it doesn’t deserve any. I encountered this book by partly trying to read “Ten miles of peach blossom” translated in English and only found the book in Chinese with an English description about what its about. I didn’t know that this book was somewhat “Ten miles of peach blossom” I just thought it was a regular Chinese fantasy book, which is the biggest reason why I bought it, because I was interested in any good Chinese fantasy book and wanted to see what’s so great about it. I’ve barely read that far into the book not because I wasn’t liking the story, I was it’s just that I don’t always read the same book I like to read books at different times or at the same time. I’m writing this review now because I just found out about something very sad and disappointing.... A week or so ago I found the manga version of “Ten miles of peach blossom” on manga rock an app that lets you read mostly any kind of manga that you may think of from any author. I was scrolling through manga that they recommended to me based on the ones I read and liked. I was surprised and glad that I would finally get to read “Ten miles of peach blossom”, but as I read a few pages I thought I recognized the setting of the book where Susu was pregnant and about to give birth to Ye Hua’s child from the book “To the sky kingdom” I realized a little than that despite the different names of the books they are both the same story. I looked up online to see if both books were in a series and then fully realized that this definitely is “Ten miles of peach blossom” or “Eternal love” which people like to call it. I then looked to read some reviews on people’s thoughts of the book on good reads and what I read from some Chinese people made the right side of my cheek burn with embarrassment. Apparently this book is not actually written by the person Tang Qi who calls themselves the author but is a plagiarized work from another author who wrote a gay novel and other books. I felt so ashamed to have realized that I payed for a book that was funding a theft and probably hurting the original authress more wherever she may be. After reading the reviews I immediately took the book from my bookshelf and put it in my cart to sell on a sell back book website."
1006,0,"Watch the series first and then read the book. The book will fill in some settle holes missed from the series. I liked I was able to imagine the additional details in the book with reference to the characters and scenery shown in the series. If you are a big fan of the main characters you will also enjoy the book more because it  focuses primarily on them, less side stories."
1007,0,I first took notice of this story when I saw the television series called Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms also called Eternal love!  I of course fell in love with the character Ye Hua strong but giving of course he had his faults to! The female character Bai Qian I wasn't crazy about the woman she was absorbed in herself she couldn't see anything or anyone!  But still it was a good love story because what is love but blind? I would recommend it if you like sci-fi fantasy mixed with romance!
1008,0,I first watched the series named Ten Miles Of Peach Blossoms aka: Eternal Love which was such an amazing and beautiful series that I had to read this book version. I believe the series and the book each has their own unique story telling and twice now I have cried and fell in love with the two characters. Such a touching and lovely story of love.
1009,0,"What I didn't like was that we weren't able to really tell and dive into the minds of Ye Hua and Mo Yuan. What were they really thinking or feeling? I understand it was all coming from the heroine telling it, but it would have been lovely to know them both on a more deeper level. All in all it was still a good read and I truly enjoyed it!"
1010,0,Falling in love with Ye Hua!
1011,0,"I watched the series Ten miles of Peach blossoms in Netflix and cannot move on to Ye Hue and Qian Qian love story. I stumbled upon this book in Amazon and so glad I did. I read it word by word picturing the series I watched several times, fell in love again and cried my heart out once more. I love this story and I am so moved by the way the author presented his story in detail and the translator did an excellent job expressing emotions in words. Highly recommended to bookworms. You will not get disappointed. I promise."
1012,0,"This video is in two distinct parts as it aired twenty-five years ago., depicting the young, winsome figure of David in part I, then in part II, David as king.  The cases are almost completely different with American actor Timothy Bottoms in the title role in the first part and in part II Keith Michell, an English actor best known for the BBC series ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" playing the mature David."
1013,0,"It was filmed in Israel on a shoestring budget but this is redeemed by excellent acting and writing on a high level of erudition.  Many of the supporting roles and background actors are played by locals, and even one or two of the more important parts."
1014,0,"This video predates widescreen format, unfortunately."
1015,0,"Close to the bible , with some liberties. Acting was ok. Some things were a little confusing, but that could just be me trying to keep up with the history . I liked the part 2 better then part 1.  I did like Jeremiah, Joseph, and Esther, also from the same collection better. They received 5 stars. If you like the bible it is worth watching. Jane Seymore's acting was very , very good as Bathsheba."
1016,0,"This was a made for television movie from the 1970's. It is the story of Saul as well as David, as their lives were so intertwined. The story is split into two different parts, each is as long as a full-length movie so we split it up over two nights. This telling of the story is more accurate to the Bible than the others I have seen, and maybe that is due to the long length, where they were not under pressure to cut so much out. The thing that may confuse you, is the fact that they have two different actors playing David.  But in keeping with scriptural accuracy, David is shown with red hair, and many bible scholars agree that the reference to his appearance being ""ruddy"" is translated from the original test as ""red"" or red haired."
1017,0,"The story begins with David as a humble shepherd who becomes harp player to King Saul who is very emotionally strained after the prophet Samuel chastises him for failing to follow God's instructions in a battle. Samuel advises Saul that God will anoint another in his place to become King in his place.  Saul's is full of jealous rage as David becomes hero to his people, and becomes anointed, so Saul and attempts to take Davids life. Naturally we have the scene of the battle of David and Goliath. The movie is very effective at showing the conflict that David has in his own reverence to Saul as Gods first anointed King over the people. He will not kill Saul, despite Saul's constant attempts on his own life, as he feels it will offend God. The story continues afters Saul's death in battle and on into David's assuming the throne. It includes the story of Bathseba, and the scenes with her bath and subsequent lovemaking with David were shown on television, but are sill too strong for the kids so prepare to send them out of the room for a bit.  We continue through David's life, the treason of one of his sons, and his eventual; passing the crown to his son Solomon late in life."
1018,0,"The acting is solid, the scrip dynamic and never slow.  Features a good musical score, good costumes and art direction, nice sets and outdoor scenery locations. Very enjoyable, this is my favorite of all the movies about the life of David the shepherd, warrior, father and king."
1019,0,"its made for tv not cinema, its like they are just going through scene by scene, no wisdom or great acting unlike many david movies before and after it"
1020,0,"The movie was good, I enjoyed watching it! Anything about the Bible is great! Reading the word of God is what gives us the real story! But watching these movie's give me joy! The acting was good! I have no complaints!  Thank you very much!"
1021,0,"One of my favorite parts of this movie was their interpretation of Saul's madness. I've never seen it presented so realistically. It also makes sense that the atmosphere was much more casual in Saul's household than we usually see in movies. The newly 'royal' family sat down to dinner at a table where everyone had his or her place. That makes sense, because in the Bible David was missing and I always wondered why Saul would have noticed or cared. David had a spot at that long, family-style table. Of course Saul would have noticed he was gone."
1022,0,"I was also able to better understand the relationship between Saul and David, and why David had some of the emotions he had about Saul. Most people would have hated him under the circumstances, but David would have remembered back when Saul was suffering and was grateful to David for the calming and healing effects of his music. He would have honored him as Yahweh's anointed. He also would have respected him because he was the father of his good friend, Jonathan, and his first wife, Micah."
1023,0,"Micah was shown first as a playful 14-year-old girl, a relationship beautifully presented, even the part years later when David insists on bringing Micah back, more as a possession at that time, the daughter of Saul, rather than because of love. Love had long since ended for both of them since he had other wives and her father had given her to another man to whom she had been happily married for years. That part was off just a little from the Biblical version, because just as her husband followed as she was taken away from him, the Bible says he followed a long way before the soldiers forcibly made him go back. In this version he barely started to follow, and not with anything like the amount of passion the Bible says he exhibited."
1024,0,"One excellent scene showed David dancing in the processing leading the Ark of the Covenant to the City of David and Micah's insulting comments to him about behavior she thought was unbecoming to him. That was well done, including his reaction. It was believable."
1025,0,"This movie was filmed in Israel. Last year I was fortunate enough to be able to spend several weeks in Israel. I visited or at least saw many of the places where the events in David's life took place. I was amazed at just how real the backgrounds were compared to the actual sites in Israel. It looked as it should have looked according to what I've learned from archeology articles, books, and videos about those areas."
1026,0,"This movie beautifully handled the problem of what the City of David really looked like. I've been particularly interested in a study of the archeology of the City of David. It was so hard for me to picture daily life in the area that has been excavated so far, particularly in the stepped houses next to the Kidron Valley and what would eventually be the Temple area, where David's palace would have been. There is much debate about whether it has been found or not. There are fascinating questions still waiting to be answered as more excavations are completed."
1027,0,"It's also not easy to picture just how sophisticated or unsophisticated interaction was at the time those events occurred. In the movie they handled it well, with a sense of humor. People peered down from upper areas or balconies, talking or yelling to each other from distances, as they (we) naturally would have done, walking and running up and down those various steps, tossing things like swords, food, etc., to one another from upper balconies. There was pottery sitting around in various places on the walls and the pots, oil lamps, and other household items look just like those I've seen from archeological excavations. The people, animals, and soldiers, with armor that looked like it just came from the pages of archeological textbooks, and all sorts of food. All of it looked real. I noticed that the insides and outsides of houses looked very much like the ones that have been excavated, as did the furnishings. The clothing too looked very much like what I've seen in museums and books. I think it was well researched. Obviously it isn't perfect, because there is so much that we really don't know,  but I think they did an excellent job. It's obvious that they worked hard to achieve authenticity."
1028,0,"I enjoyed the fact that the movie shows rocks everywhere, on pathways, on the hills, everywhere, just as it is today. Rocks are everywhere! They didn't 'clean up' the area to make it more ""Hollywood"". They left it as it was. I liked that."
1029,0,This movie takes us to the battle between David and Goliath.  Last year I got to see that area very briefly.  It looks as presented in this movie.
1030,0,"The important part of David's life when he hid from Saul was well represented. I saw the area of En Gedi, which was shown in this movie just as I would have imagined it after having seen the place where it happened."
1031,0,"I have a much better understanding of Samuel and the events relating to him. When I visited certain areas of Israel, I tried unsuccessfully to visualize Samuel and his interactions with Saul and David. I couldn't really wrap my mind around it in a way that helped me understand the events that happened there, but seeing this interpretation helped put it together for me."
1032,0,"A ""horned altar"" has been found in Beersheva. The original is now housed in a museum, but a copy was there in the place where the real one was found. It looked just as shown in the movie. A person seeking refuge would hold on to the horns of the altar in hopes of being spared, and which was authentically portrayed here in this movie."
1033,0,The harp music and singing of David was lovely. I've always had a struggle picturing David singing and playing his harp. I just couldn't start to understand how those words were put to music. This did help. It was well done.
1034,0,"This is an old movie. One would have trouble identifying some of the actors in it. Jane Seymour, for example, doesn't look anything at all like she does today. Also, technology has greatly improved since this movie was made, meaning everything has almost an 'antique' look about it. It for the most part added rather than distracted for me. Sure, I would rather it had been clear rather than a little fuzzy as it was at times, but it almost gave the feeling that we had gone back in time. It was a little bit on the order of watching an Italian movie with subtitles, that kind of a feel.  We're used to having things so modernized and scrubbed clean that everything is about bright colors, sunny days, and a more up-to-date version of the clothing. What we had in this movie may have been closer to the real thing."
1035,0,"All-in-all, I really enjoyed this interpretation. It helps me relate events to locations I've read about in the Scriptures. Most people watching it will gain a better understanding of the life of David, from a shepherd boy to king. You can always compare it with the actual scriptures and see how you think it compares to the original story."
1036,0,Any story about David is good.
1037,0,I love this movie.  I saw it first when I was in grade school.  It was shown in a local TV station during Holy Week.  The story shows us the rise of David as King of Israel replacing Saul.  The part I like most is when the prophet Nathan reproves David of his sins.  Then David humbled himself and confessed his sins.  The movie is a reminder to all of us that power can be abused and can corrupt anyone who abuses it.  Only God's forgiveness can redeem us.

1040,0,"This is not the International version, but the original Chinese version, Part I and Part II, and it is almost 5 hours long. It is directed by John Woo,knows how to direct an action movie.  Based on a historical event in Chinese history, the battle of Red Cliff that took place in 208 C.E. The movie is a blend of martial arts action and large scale action involving armies and there are also scenes of individuals relating to each other and building friendships. There are some incredible battle sequences and you wonder how they were able to film such large scale action sequences.  The movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles. One action sequence starts Zhou Yu, one of the leaders of the Southern coalition, get hit in the shoulder by an arrow, pulls the arrow out and then proceeds to kill the man, who fired the arrow, by stabbing him with the same arrow.  Part one ends with a to be continued and part two is worth the whole 5 hours.  The film is not the typical martial film with people flying through the air and dancing on water, The martial arts in the film is used to advance the battle sequences with individuals using various types of spears, to defeat their enemies.  As we see the various strategies come together  and battle plans unfold the action builds to  long battle sequence involving setting ships on fire, mounted cavalry, archers and hundreds of men fighting man to man.  It is John Woo at his best, You are able to care for the various characters in the film and when some of them die, you feel the loss.  The cinematography is excellent and story well written.  I really enjoyed this two part film.  The international version is a condensed version and is only one film and is not divided in two parts."
1041,0,"Why the 1 star review? I wish the film maker hadn't used such cruel methods to get the horses to perform stunts. During the battle scenes, I wondered how many horses died making this piece of entertainment. And it was a fascinating piece of Chinese history, well done in every other way. I watch old movies, and am familiar with some of the the ways that Hollywood used to use wires to get dramatic falls from horses. And it looked just like the ways the horses made dramatic falls in this film, somersaulting horses onto their necks or heads. I truly cringed through the battle scenes in this movie because of it. I don't doubt the film maker would say, ""of course no horses were harmed while filming this,"" and I don't buy it. I won't watch it again."
1042,0,"The “international Version” is my favorite version of this story. I watched the International version first followed by the US theatrical version and as everyone else said, I was greatly disappointed. You simply cannot cut the movie in half and expect to get the same story out of it. If you have only seen the international version, I would not waste your time or money purchasing, or renting the US theatrical version, and just purchase the full version. If you have only seen the theatrical version and were not that impressed, or thought it lacked more of a plot, it would be worth your time to watch the full international version before judging the movie."
1043,0,"The reason for not giving this 5 stars is not based on the movie but the fact that Amazon leads you to believe that your purchase comes with the instant video option so you can play it on your portable devices. Amazon, in fact only give you access to the first video digitally, not the full set that you are actually purchasing. Even though I was purchasing the DVD set, I always look for the digital copies and I use the DVD’s as a backup. I mostly watch videos on my phone or tablet, and now my Amazon Fire Stick, with this purchase I am left in the 90’s until I get home to play the second video on DVD."
1044,0,"The Art of War and it is so intricate and impeccably shot- If you blink your eyes you will miss something. John Woo took this story from events from a 208 A.D. battle that changed China forever. It is so masterfully shot, the acting superb,  plot, costumes, backgrounds & locations are nothing less than perfect. Then come the battle sequences-incredibly complicated and devastating as they are-it is almost like watching a complex dance play out. Truly stunning to behold. How John Woo shot this is nothing short of astounding. Perhaps the finest film of this genre ever. If you liked  Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon, Shogun or similar films- this one tops them all - but get ready to take a day to watch this- it clocks in at 4.5 hours and the International Version is the one you want to see- for there are different edits of the film that gut the story to try to make it more marketable to Western audiences. Get the original- it absolutely is worth the watch. A masterpiece in film making."
1045,0,Red Cliff is an exceptional film. It is a modern day classic the Lawrence of Arabia of our time. John Wu  has directed a masterpiece. The photography is just stunning. Although there are a lot of computer generated shots they blend seemlessly into the film and only enhance the motion picture elements.
1046,0,"The storyline is based on a telling of a historical event in Chinese history that is widely known in China but not so much outisde of Asia. Wu has enhanced the traditional storyline with his own additions. What is amazing is how fast this movie goes. Despite it being something like five hours long, one is spellbound with the acting, visuals and effects. The film is not slow or boring at all. I watched it again and finally ordered a copy of my own because this is such a wonderful film that I will definitely watch it over and over again through the years."
1047,0,"John Wu has out done himself with this truly great work of cinema. I only wish I had seen it on the big screen in the theater. The acting is terrific and even though there is not an English track and one has to ""read"" the movie, it is not too overwhelming to read since there are many extended visuals. I highly recommend this excellent film of the first order. It's great fun!"
1048,0,"Wow!  I bought this earlier on dvd and felt the movie was epic in scope.  But, in Blu-Ray, the opening credits almost seem 3D-like and the picture quality just blew me away.  In blu-ray, one can appreciate the cgi effects even more.  As a story, this truly was epic with battle scenes that are savagely beautiful to watch like a violent ballet of martial arts. Because I don't understand Chinese, I was able to focus on the expressions on the actors while reading the subtitles.  The cast was well chosen and well acted.  Based upon a pivotal moment in Chinese history, the story comes alive under John Woo's skillful direction.  Because of my love for this movie which, as of this writing, I've probably already viewed both Parts I & II in its entirety at least 5 times, I was inspired to see other Chinese and Korean movies based upon their warlord past histories.  Red Cliff continues to stand out as the best of the best."
1049,0,"I had been wanting to see the complete cut (International Version - Part I & II) of Red Cliff for a long time now, so I was very happy to find the time to sit down and finally view this nearly 5 hour beast over the period of two weekends. Too bad it never got it's due respect over here and got a proper wide release. Do yourself and favor and don't even bother with the Theatrial Version that is lacking over TWO HOURS of material."
1050,0,"John Woo has made some entertaining films, like Face/Off, in the past, but this is his first true masterpiece. All of the actors, locations, individual fights and huge battles are fantastic. The scale of these battles are probably the largest ever filmed. I'm talking Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King on steroids."
1051,0,"The only very minor negatives would be that it was somewhat hard at times reading the subtitles for such a long period of time. I wouldn't have it any other way (I hate dubbing), but be prepared to miss what's happening on the screen while you're trying to keep up with the words. It gets a bit easier after the first half hour or so. Also, the martial arts scenes during the battles are very well done and keep things interesting, but they kind of take away from the realism (a single guy slaughtering dozens with ease)."
1052,0,"The picture quality is right at the top of my growing Blu-ray collection, and the audio is earth shattering through my speaker system. I don't have the time to mess with them, but the special features run almost as long as the movie itself. Very impressive."
1053,0,"If you love any kind of historical epics like Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven, Red Cliff is worth a look at minimum. Just be prepared to have your reading glasses on."
1054,0,"The music is wonderful, the characters delightful, the villain suitably formidable, and the story fascinating. I have seen both the commercial 2+ hour version and the longer international version.  I prefer the longer version because it explores one of the sub-plots in much greater depth, and includes details that make it easier to understand what is happening and why."
1055,0,"The DVD set arrived in a timely manner, in the good condition as advertised.  This is a contemporary classic for serious collectors of excellent cinema.  While certain liberties were taken with history and the text of the enduring heroic novel, ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS, the film works and works well.  The king of over-the-top massive, explosive productions, director John Woo did not neglect character revelations and other subtleties that make for dramatic balance."
1056,0,"Ok, don't get me wrong; I loved this movie. Unfortunately, it was cut in half for ""western audiences"". And, there was no indication of this fact in Amazon's synopsis. Yes, this half of the movie was great. But, you're really not even going to tell us that we're only getting half of it? I heard about it, and wanted the full movie. I googled it and amazon came up; I am a prime member, so I figured: sweet, I can rent it for 3 bucks. Had no idea I was only getting half. Extremely disappointed that my movie experience was ruined by ""Hollywood"". This is the first ever amazon review I have written, because I love movies that much, and amazon completely ruined it for me."
1057,0,"The names in the books are all wrong! Everyone know Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. The author westernizes their names; given name, surname. The main characters are now called "" Bei Lui, Yu Guan, and Dei Zhang."" It is such a shame!  The graphics are nice though."
1058,0,"Fei Zhang is raising an army in the city of GuCheng.  Hearing that Yu Guan is arriving in GuCheng, Fei Zhang prepares to do battle with the man he regards as a traitor for joining forces with Cao Cao.  The confusion is interrupted (and eventually resolved) by a battle scene that heralds the arrival of Fei Zhang's brother, Bei Liu.  Together they command an army of 5,000 soldiers, but it will take a larger army to defeat Cao Cao."
1059,0,"Chapter 2 momentarily diverts the course of the story from war to peace.  It tells of an assassination and the victim's unwillingness to accept the fact of his own death.  The story is notable for a conversation between the dead man and his dead father about the possibility (or impossibility) of making a better world ""without appeasing all that is vindictive and cruel.""  Equally interesting are the discussions that rulers have concerning the desirability of starting a war to solidify public support for the ruler -- a concept that has relevance to the modern western world."
1060,0,"War finally breaks out in chapter 3 as Shao Yuan's army of 700,000 takes on Cao Cao's elite 70,000.  The war continues through chapter 4.  Readers who are students of military strategy will enjoy this, while the art impressively conveys the vast battlefield as large armies contend with each other using ancient (but clever) weaponry."
1061,0,"As always in this series, I enjoyed the dialog, with its tendency toward snarky sarcasm.  The art is beautifully detailed.  Facial expressions are emotive; battle scenes blaze with action.  The coloring is subtle, never garish.  As is true in every volume, explanatory text repeats (in narrative form) the story that the graphic novel tells, and provides additional information -- maps, a cast of characters, a discussion of the story's themes -- that add helpful context.  Still, you don't have to be a student of (or have an interest in) ancient Chinese history to enjoy this series.  Any fan of good graphic storytelling should appreciate it."
1062,0,"This book largely concerns the madness of Yuan Shao, whose armies of over 1 million are obliterated by Cao Cao's, under the strategic leadership of the sickly Guo Jia. Is shorter episodes involving our three sworn brothers Zhang Fei is united with Guan Yu, but of course he acts like a mistrusting ape and nearly makes a mess of everything, while Guan Yu simply destroys all enemies. The two are then reunited with Liu Bei (and, of course, we have by this time forgotten why they were separated in the first place, actually...). The story is interspersed with a very trippy episode as Sun Ce has a philosophical conversation/hallucination with his father while lying in a near-death state after being ambushed by assassins; and with a ""SPLOCK"" he's gone, setting the stage for Sun Quan to step out of his shadow and grow from a boy into a warlord."
1063,0,"The second half of the book is all about the battles between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao, and there's plenty of blood and decapitated heads, although here are also lighter moments of Cao Cao joking around with his generals that are, well, a little odd and peculiar. But it's still a great story, full of stunning art, and a good balance between bloodshed, characterisation, and plot development."
1064,0,"Price as expected, quick delivery. Books are well produced,  fairly small print (I am older) is somewhat off set by good print quality."
1065,0,"The Three Kingdoms set came exactly as described and were in excellent condition. I really liked this edition because it's split into 4 small-sized books that are easy to carry around in a purse to read whenever and wherever. The books also came promptly. Overall, there is nothing I have to complain about this product and I would recommend it to anyone who has wanted to read an English-language translation of this classic Chinese tale."
1066,0,Very good translation but with a few minor grammatical errors here and there.
1067,0,Arrived on time. There are a few typos but nothing major.
1068,0,"The only cons I see thus far are the very few and very minor typos, plus the very thin pages. Also, the first two physical pages of the first volume where stuck together, and I had to use scissors to separate them."
1069,0,Arrived as promised.  Happy with product.
1070,0,The first book has exceeded my expectations. Second book is just as exciting as the first. Can't put it down!
1071,0,"Far and away the best translation of Luo Guanzhong's ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", this four volume work contains both an incredible introduction containing both the history and context of the work along with detailed notes at the end of each volume. A must have until Penguin Classics translation comes out (translation is currently in the works), this is without a doubt the best and most informative English translation of the work."
1072,0,"Prior to reading this book the Three Kingdoms of Ancient China: The History and Legacy of the Reunification of China after the Han Dynasty, I knew very little about the ancient history of China.  The book lists a website that can be used to translate Chinese words.  The ancient Chinese had a concept called Mandate of Heaven which is similar to the Divine Rights of Kings concept that was used in Europe.  The Mandate of Heaven in theory was given from heaven to a leader who would act in benevolence and righteousness for the Chinese people, and could be lost by the Emperor who did not display these characteristics.  The book describes in a concise and brief manner the fall of the Han Dynasty, the fighting that gave rise to the three kingdoms, and the final battles that led to the unification of China.  The book has an extensive bibliography.  I recommend the book to anyone who is interested in ancient Chinese history."
1073,0,I believe the info is accurate but the style prevents reader involvement. Still looking for a good history of China.
1074,0,The author does a good job of explaining this period in Chinese history.  However you tend to get lost with all the different Chinese names.

1076,0,Tiny pamphlet.  There are definitely inconsistencies and inaccuracies when compared to other sources.
1077,0,"A good brief overview of the fall of the Han Dynasty through the Three Kingdoms era, and reunification. It is an essay so it is expectedly short and does not go into much detail on any of the political figures of the time."
1078,0,This book is short and well articulated. Good for history lovers who are pretty busy with other fields. Thank you.

1081,0,Somehow I never felt as if I really was getting into this. It read more like a. Senior class project than a historical account of what must have been an important and formative part of China.

1092,0,"The Battle of Chibi (Red Cliffs) is an ancient and complex Chinese saga superbly edited and translated by author/scholar Hock Tjoa.  As a scholarly work, it is an absolute triumph.  The source materials seem very elaborate and daunting, and the author should be lauded for presenting this material to modern western audiences."
1093,0,"With that being said, however, although the book is a stupendous cultural achievement, actually reading it is a bit polarizing.  Many reviewers have praised the characters and storylines, but I found it all to be just too much.  It's not just that there are an astounding amount of characters -- the issue is none of them are really developed enough to distinguish them or care about them.  This is obviously no fault of Mr. Tjoa; this is often the nature of ancient sagas, no matter which culture they originate from."
1094,0,"Mr. Tjoa himself is quite fascinating, however, and I would love to see him devote his efforts to a literary work that could really showcase his academic and literary talents.  In addition to Chibi, he has also written classic Chinese plays, and modern-day Asian spymaster tales.  I, however, would love to see him write a full-length novel in the style and setting of Chibi, but with well-developed characters and storylines:  Warriors, emperors, princesses, eunuchs, bandits, peasants, and philosophers.  Perhaps a ""Game of Thrones"" meets ""The Last Airbender.""  Considering his talent, I'll bet it would be awesome."
1095,0,It’s quite apparent to me that the author of this translation of ancient Chinese history/fiction is a scholar who seeks to preserve his culture in current vernacular. The story is reminiscent of early narratives of many cultures. Warring tribes as well as battles for control of land and power are rich treasures of antiquity.
1096,0,"That being said, the collection of stories from the Battle of Chibi was quite difficult for me to read and comprehend. The author of this translation, Hock Tjoa, tries to create context with early maps and interspersed commentary. He presents a glossary of characters prior to reading this example of Chinese literature, yet I struggled to understand the importance of each. Who were the good guys and who were the bad ones? The prologue helps to set the story within the historical context of three separate kingdoms in ancient China. “When the Empire is divided for long, it unites; when united for long, it falls apart; this is the nature of the history of All under Heaven [China].”"
1097,0,"I applaud Tjoa’s tenacity for extending the readership of these ancient Chinese stories by translating them into English. Unfortunately, general readers will be as lost as I was trying to understand the political background of ancient Chinese society. For example, I knew nothing about the eunuchs who played a huge role in royal courts, even into modern history. I needed to research that element to understand the historical context. I would suggest adding the information within the prologue."
1098,0,"Just as ancient biblical texts have been translated into common vernacular, there is great merit in the preservation of The Battle of Chibi as an example of ancient Asian literature. On the negative side, the stories had no meaning for me. The characters were not developed by the author of this translation. Instead, Tjoa attempted to make them come to life by having the dialog more current. Nonetheless, within two pages we have Xun You, Xun Yu, and Xu You. Terribly confusing. In fact, there were so many characters, I was literally lost."
1099,0,"Since the author notes that other English translations of the Battle of Chibi exist, though not in more current vernacular, perhaps he would consider writing a historical novel based on Chibi, not a translation. There could be a main character, clearly identified, with a frame of reference for the story. A flowing narrative with a well-developed point of view could make this Chinese history come alive. I imagine Tjoa’s work would merit 5 stars in the eyes of a Chinese scholar. For me, it was a struggle."
1100,0,"Though The Battle of Chibi is an abridged version of the historical Chinese novel: “The Romance of the Three Kingdoms,” it is still undeniably a daunting read, mainly because it leaves out many human elements of the saga, focusing principally on the battle. For example, it introduces the three main protagonists, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei at the point where they take their famous oath, swearing to die together. The original saga—The Romance—on the other hand, gives more insight into the life story of these men as well as indications on how they first met, offering the reader, not only clarity but interest as well. Knowledge of the back-story—of Liu Bei as an impoverished young man who made a living selling straw sandals and weaving grass mats, or of Zhang Fei as a wine-seller and butcher, seems at once more appealing than the intimidating story of war. But, of course, the battles are an integral part of The Romance and focusing on them does not in any way dilute the power of the work. It, in fact, offers an accessible and stirring glimpse into the dramatic lives of feudal lords who held sway in China in an era sheathed in myth, magic, and deadly power struggles. It is undeniably a fascinating epic."
1101,0,"This is clearly a work filled with the devotion of an author who wants to preserve and honor the history of his people. I am filled with admiration for the sheer amount of work that went into the translation process itself, and have nothing but respect for the effort that went into making this a story more palatable for those of us who know next to nothing about ancient China."
1102,0,"That said, I found reading this a daunting task, especially as the author deemed it necessary to include a section on how to read the book in the first place. I'm grateful that I was able to read on my computer rather than an e-reader, which made it somewhat easier to return to those reading instructions and character lists as I read. I often found myself confused by the many similar character names, and had to set myself straight."
1103,0,"Sadly, my biggest takeaway after reading was that mankind's ""all for me and nothing for you"" attitudes in relation to land, resources and riches is clearly universal and seemingly eternal. In spite of all the many changes that have taken place over the centuries, the desire to go to war with our fellow man remains unchanged, and our justifications for launching such campaigns still speak to the underlying greed of the rich older men who care little for the younger men they send to their deaths."
1104,0,"A challenging read, but well worth the effort."
1105,0,"This book comprises a selection of chapters translated and annotated from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, an 800,000 word 14th century novel set in a turbulent period of Chinese history more than a thousand years earlier. Part historical, part mythological, it is one of the classics of Chinese Literature. And like most literary classics, not exactly a quick or easy read."
1106,0,"While the author's introduction and comments do much to place the story in context, the first chapters of the book, summing up the events leading up to the actual Battle of Chibi, or Red Cliffs, is such a litany of minor events and characters that it almost reads like a telephone book. A bit of a cold shower to start off with, but once you get into it, or past it, it all comes nicely together, picking up pace and gaining color to reveal a fascinating, epic world of intrigue, strategy and treachery akin to that of Game of Thrones."
1107,0,"Epic, strategic, fiery and brutal battles with hundreds of thousands of men, intrigue, betrayal after betrayal, loyalty and beheading, and fascinating Chinese history, philosophy and culture is presented in this saga translated by historian and scholar on Chinese thought, Hock Tjoa. Clearly, it took an epic amount of energy and time to complete the task of translating the selected chapters from The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. A scholarly accomplishment no doubt a highly valuable contribution to the understanding of Chinese history and political thought."
1108,0,I had very little Chinese history awareness so each thread of this scholarly achievement was new information.
1109,0,"Reading was difficult due to the nature of the story: many characters I couldn't keep straight, who did what when and how it related to previous loyalty and betrayal was a effort I didn't have the stamina to keep up with. It's a difficult read but I finished it, a chapter or two at a time, with a gritted determination. It was well worth the time and energy spent to get an overall picture of the end of the Han Dynasty."
1110,0,"Vol. 2 of 3K touched me in a special way. Vol. 1 was a good appetizer. Vol. 2 is the main course. I enjoyed It especially because it gave me insights into people who I experience in daily life. Liu Bei got his vision of who he was from being a descendant of political leaders. His work experience was only as a maker of straw sandals, but his vision of who he is, is based on his ancestors. To him, this qualified him to be the Emperor of China. We all know that character traits can genetically be passed from one generation to another. Often character traits skip a generation and appear in a second or third generation person. His inheritance opened the doorway to a place of possible political leadership."
1111,0," Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei's senior Advisor, is the ultimate networker. The fact that he was a person of wisdom enabled him to come up with ideas and schemes. With these qualities he was able, through networking, to be able to overcome great challenges. He was not wealthy nor did he carry a weapon other than his ability to wisely advise. Amazing."
1112,0," Liu Bei's ultimate challenger, his nemesis, was Cao Cao whose ability was to charge forward with great energy in an aggressive way. Often he seems ruthless in his efforts, but this is the way of the person who obsessively charges onward to achieve his goals."
1113,0, Sun Quan seems like a person who finds himself promoted into a position that is really beyond his skills and talents. He relies on advisors and skillful supporters to maintain his position.
1114,0, It is easy to relate these main characters in Three Kingdom to people we meet and deal with today. This book gives me insight into dealing with people I deal with in everyday life.
1115,0, This version of Three Kingdoms was an easy read. All the Chinese names and places quickly began to confuse me however the list of main characters and who they were listed at the front of the book was a big help in getting through the exciting events written in this book.
1116,0,If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series. This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter. There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions. The names and places are spelled/pronounced more accurately. This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.
1117,0,"A new character was introduced at the conclusion of volume 1 who was to play a critical role in this epic adventure. Serendipity comes to Liu Bei in volume 2 as the new character becomes his advisor. The new character leads Liu Bei to military success over Cao Cao’s forces with clever winning strategies. However, the twist in the plot a few pages later reveals the perils of deceit and cunning to which Cao Cao is capable."
1118,0,"Incidents like this seem to mirror real life today; what seems like bad luck actually becomes good luck. In this situation the loss of his wise advisor opens an opportunity for Liu Bei. The advisor, as he is leaving, makes a recommendation to Liu Bei that will change the dynamics of all that has come before. We gather from the sequence of events to follow a whole new range of exciting strategies and episodes, filled with surprises."
1119,0,Best translation that I have of the series. I have 4 different ones. Very happy with this book.
1120,0,Stunning world literature! Excellent translation.
1121,0,good
1122,0,Absolutely love them
1123,0,My 14 yo son read this book in one night.  He loves these kinds of novels.
1124,0,"A great followup to volume 1. Well-written translation, epic story..."
1125,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
1126,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
1127,0,"Now with this, the eleventh volume, we get one of the main climaxes of the tale - the battle of the Red Cliff, between the forces of Cao Cao and Song Quan, with Liu Bei and his army taking a back seat. In fact, the main character of this tale is probably Zhou Yu, who seems to be running the show, although it is his hostage Zhuge Liang, who is pulling the strings in actual fact. Strange schemers like Pang Tong enter the picture, only to disappear again, and we see both Cao Cao and Zhou Yu nearly descend into madness, as is seen by the former's drunken, murderous antics during a drunken banquet on the eve of battle (who celebrates a victory before the fight has begun?!?), and the latter's strange disease. The closing one third of the book is occupied by the annihilation of Cao Cao's army and navy, and his tragic retreat."
1128,0,"The books were created after the film, but there are many episodes from the film that do not appear in this book, such as Zhuge Liang's romance, or the epidemic of the soldiers. But the fire remains, and we also get the humiliation and tragic retreat of the prime minister of Han, which is drawn out and quite thoroughly dramatized. Nice!!"
1129,0,"Just finished my review for The Legend of the Shadowless Sword""  which disappointed nut I recommended it for teanager, 13-17yrs.....""Three Kindoms"" came in the same mail and what a difference,,,glorious vistas, superb acting, and a logical story.  .. the historical period in China well done ...this an ""adult"" video, can't go wrong showing it with friends....excellent action, respected honor between enemies and a too brief philosophical discussion of what years of constant war accomplished, these are ambitious men but they are not stupid which is the large plus for this dvd. if you already have or are just starting this is a MUST fr your Asian collection."
1130,0,"More & more we see great movies coming from overseas. Hollywood no longer holds sway over movie making great films are coming out of the U.K., China, Japan & other country's. Many don't even bother dubbing the movie for the benefit of English speaking audiences. This one does & it doesn't loose a lot through the dubbing process as some foreign films do. It has a lot of good action & is very entertaining. If you like sword play, martial arts & action you might want to ad this to your collection."
1131,0,"While I haven't watched the whole movies yet (there are 18 DVD's with five 45 minute shows) I really enjoy what I've seen so far. The overall production of the movie and the acting is excellent. My only complaint (hence the four stars) is that the English subtitles randomly have capital ""N""'s in the dialogue. For example, ""Nit might read like Nthis"" instead of ""it might read like this"". This can be confusing when the ""N"" shows up before a Chinese name you are not familiar with or any English word starting with a vowel."
1132,0,If you've read the Moss Roberts unabridged translation of Three Kingdoms ([...] you'll enjoy this movie. If you haven't read the book then you should because you'll enjoy the movie even more.
1133,0,"It was pretty much what I expected. I swear these great epic films never have a happy ending. In most all of the them the hero dies, I have no idea why Chinese films always kill off their heroes, but oh well."
1134,0,Great film
1135,0,So so
1136,0,"a great tribute movie honoring the incomparable zhao yun, zhang fei, guan yu and lui bei. a different take of one of the greatest warriors of the three kingdoms era. the ages old irony, those in war desire peace and those in peace desire war."
1137,0,"This movie just doesn't hang together. Andy Lau is solid as Zhao Zilong, and American Maggie Q actually does a really good job as a dark warrior-general. Her Wuxia vibe felt legit to me. As far as the acting itself, the whole cast has it going on."
1138,0,"The problem is with the story that's supposed to be driving the characters. It covers the span of the protagonist's life in a few disjointed chunks. We're never with the characters long enough in one time and place to truly connect. As a result, it's hard to feel the nostalgia that gets poured on thick in the next scene from a decade (or 2) down the road. And not just nostalgia - the film repeatedly prompts us to experience heavy emotions of various sorts, and we'd like to oblige, but the movie hasn't done the developmental legwork to make it happen."
1139,0,"There's lots of martial action, but like the rest of the film, though competent it tends to fall flat. Also, for those who like some eye-candy with their Wuxia, there's very little in that department, as we're on the battlefield in full gear most of the time. A contrived puppy-love story crash lands into the narrative early on, then is just as hastily jettisoned. Maggie Q is kinda sexy in the haughty, shrewd, commanding Warrior Queen way that brings all the Wuxia boys to the yard. But, as with the other characters, the narrative treatment is too abbreviated to fan the flicker to a flame."
1140,0,"It's too bad. It seems there was potential here. But in the end, we're left with not much more than a clunky, uninspiring film."
1141,0,"this is a more modern series than the earlier one and uses cgi extensively.  they have also updated the  series to improve the flow and given lu bu a much more sympathetic character.  it is really dominated by cao cao who has much better lines and probably due for some rehabilitation--the other ""heroes"" were't much better."
1142,0,Good movie it's based over the Waring States Period if you know Chinese History a little then you know what i'm talking about and Sammo Hung is in the movie also if your a fan which I am.
1143,0,There has been an increase these days in the amount of graphic novels and shorter graphic books being published.  This 48 page graphic universe book (Guan Yu: Blood brothers to the end: a Chinese legend by Dan Jolley and Ron Randall) is one of several graphic publications put out by Lerner Publishing Group. I have read several of these in the past and I picked up this one on Amazon for a bargain price.
1144,0,"This ancient Chinese Legend book covers the following material:  The legend begins, blood brothers united, a new allegiance, the journey home, blood brothers once more, the path to enlightenment, glossary and pronunciation guide, and further reading and websites."
1145,0,The story is beautifully told and the illustrations are fantastic.  Even though these books are aimed for children I think adults would also enjoy reading this graphic story.
1146,0," If you are a fan of graphic novels you should check out this book.  My only complaint is the short length of this volume (48 pages), but it is still a good read."
1147,0,"Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Pro-Systems Combatives Vol. 1,2.)"
1148,0,"A Pole Arm is slightly heavier than a sword, but it requires more concentration to keep opponents from closing in. Guan Yu was skilled in using his cutting pole arm and was well known for it. There should be more films showing Guan Yu fighting, instead a red figure in the background. This book shows younger readers that no matter how outnumbered you are, if you develop an effective skill than you can survive with determination. Over history wars were not sword skirmishes, there were spearmen and polearms. The God of Martial Arts is a great motivation for any Martial Artist."
1149,0,"Well done art with an interesting text, this little graphic book brings the story of one of the patron immortals of Chinese history to life. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Chinese history, but who may want a colorful, easy read."
1150,0,My Fiance loves eastern history and being that Guan Yu is a Chinese legend he was thrilled when I purchased this for his birthday.
1151,0,"Although the translation is atrocious, and the book is poorly redacted, it may be the most concise version ever made of this fantastic book, which should get a lot more credit in the West. Also, the names of all the characters are properly translated and maintained, something vital to the comprehension of the massive novel. The poetry isn't too bad, as well, but some passages are absolute tangles of incomprehensible and broken English. Personally, some simple mistakes, repeated along the 1000 pages of the Romance, became very grating, like ""the Cao Cao's army""."
1152,0,"I can still recommend it for skilled readers, because it's the only version for Kindle at an affordable price, and it's quicker to read than other translations."
1153,0,"It may be ponderous to read, and possibly difficult to keep track of everyone, but it was an enjoyable read for me."
1154,0,After watching Red Cliff I had the desire to read more of the before and after. This book filled that desire.
1155,0,"If one want's to learn a bit more about individuals, or discern fact from fiction, the link on the kindle that takes you to Wikipedia is a useful tool."
1156,0,"This book is very long and can be hard to get through due to the overwhelming amount of characters and events going on.  As an American, there is a culture barrier for me there as well.  However I am thankful I persevered through the story.  I've always been a big Dynasty Warriors fan, and Redcliff is one of my favorite movies. It was great to get a more complete picture of the events of the Three Kingdoms, and all the little details and interactions.  A great read if you can make it through!"
1157,0,"I was introduced to the world of Romance of the Three Kingdoms thanks to the Dynasty Warriors game, and decided I wanted to read to original work that the games were based on. This is actually the second copy of the story that I've bought; the first had a drastically different translation style -- Liu Bei was Liu Pei, Guan Yu was Kuan Yu, etc -- and it was off-putting enough that I found it difficult to follow."
1158,0,"For those who are here because of the same reason I was, you'll be pleased to know that this printing shares the vast majority of the translations with the games we know and love. Sun Ce is Sun Ce, not Sun T'se!"
1159,0,"One of the problems with ordering a book on Kindle is that you don't know its full length in pages. ""The romance of three Kingdoms must be a rather thick volume and it is more a historical chronicle than a romance. For a non-Chinese the profusion of names and places make it confusing ( a map and a register of persons would have helped ). So , although it is ineresting ,it is also tiring"
1160,0,R.Simon
1161,0,"Superb, still one of the best piece of literatures. I have read it many times in other language. It is interesting to read it in English and see some variations in the interpretation of the translator. There are problems due to name pronunciations."
1162,0,"I quite like books that are long even if they are very dry, like economics books.  But this one was a bit too not good to read.  It reads like a very simple story but too many characters are thrown at you for no more than a line or two and you end up lost trying to unnecessarily remember them all."
1163,0,"Its a good story, but not very readable."
1164,0,I love the stories. I first learned about the three kingdoms playing DYNASTY WARRIORS and reading the book brought real depth and insight into the history. A great read if you can overlook some typos and bad translations.
1165,0,"The characters names get to be to much, since they are Chinese name they get to be hard to remember, but it is a great read.  The action moves right alone so name are not to much of problem."
1166,0,The Romance of Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong is an exceptional book. I recommend it to all from my heart.
1167,0,very good
1168,0,"light paper, but characters are not small."
1169,0,"Not as advertised.  The title of the book, and the ""Look Inside"" contents show both pinyin and Chinese characters.  However, the book itself only has Chinese characters.  As a Chinese language learner, I need both.  I would not have purchased this book had I known."
1170,0,Perfect book. I love the fact that is hardback and the Hanzi aren't tiny. And the book is small enough to put in my purse and I can carry it anywhere.
1171,0,good
1172,0,"At $1.99, with enabled table of contents, excellent value. There are no notes nor explanatory matter. If the great number of characters is confusing you can find maps, relationship charts, and other resources at the 3Kingdoms Podcast site."
1173,0,Great story. Well made book. Fast shipping. The print is tiny to the point of being too hard for these old eyes to read. Invest the extra money for a legible print size
1174,0,Excellent book about the Romance warring era. Just wish the print was a little bigger. Tons of characters to keep track of too.
1175,0,This edition of the Chinese classic has print that's unreadably tiny.  The print margins are nearly non-existent and the print's uneven on the pages.  I had to send it back.
1176,0,good read
1177,0,What else can I say?
1178,0,"One word ""Epic"""
1179,0,Print size so small it gave me a headache. I'm talking pocket bible size font...beware.
1180,0,Exactly what i expected and arrived early.
1181,0,A lot of life lessons can be learned with an open mind.
1182,0,5 Stars
1183,0,"Magically enchanting, and wonderfully addicting, THE BITTER KINGDOM delivers an explosive conclusion that will leave you breathless and yearning for more!!! From it's rich lure of fantasy blend, and it's thickened plot, to it's breathtakingly hypnotic romance, and non-stop action and adventure, and magical background that solidifies this series to it's fullest. THE BITTER KINGDOM was one hell of a finale that I am utterly satisfied with, but drastically needing more..."
1184,0,"I am speechless after reading THE BITTER KINGDOM. I feel like my feelings are all jumbled and no words I can form will do it nearly any justice. There are no words to express the full depth and love I have for this book--no series. This series is one of those series that will stay with me for a very long time. And I'm saddened to see it all end, as I still want more from these characters and this world. But either way I still really enjoyed the way this series ended, even though at the same time it felt incomplete. But it doesn't really matter because it was an EPIC journey though it all!!"
1185,0,"Like I said above, this book ended great, it was absolutely wonderful. But, I still did feel that their were still too many unanswered questions that were left open at the close of this series. And it kept picking at me long after this book was over. It felt like it wasn't the end of the series and that another book would follow. It just didn't wrap up as good as I hoped it would have. I would of liked to see how some of the side charters ended up after the battle was all said and done. I guess I just wanted more from the epilogue, and to see how things fared after the main plot was played out. BUT nevertheless, it still delivered in more ways then one, and has stole my heart and branded it's world forever in my soul."
1186,0,"The writing was as elegant and suspenseful as ever, and the characters had so much growth and development that it was heart-warming to see the strength they were able to pull from each other through all their struggles. I loved watching them through each book as they went through and endured each obstacles that tested them to their fullest, and were able to find the strength and endurance at each turn to overcome their predicaments and become stronger and more determined then ever!"
1187,0,THE PLOT
1188,0,"Elisa has failed her kingdom, and now she's paying the price for that failure..."
1189,0,"Betrayed by supposed allies in her most trusted circle, Elisa is now hunted, a wanted fugitive in her own kingdom. Hiding amongst her own people, trying to blend in and cope with the capture of the captain of her guard and the man she's slowly came to love. Elisa can't possibly imagine it getting anymore complicated, but boy is she wrong. It's about to become a sandstorm of madness..."
1190,0,ELISA HAS 5 GOALS:
1191,0,"1-Free her beloved Hector before he makes to Invierne in enemy hands, and surfers a fate unimaginable. 2-Safely enter the City of Invierne and stop the impending war that's on their way to her kingdoms doorstep. 3-Meet with the neighboring kingdoms Queens, her sister Alodia, and her good friend Cosmé, to forge a health alliance and hopefully join their kingdoms. 4-Stop civil war from tearing her kingdom apart at the hands of the fellow Quorum Lord Eduardo, before it's to late. 5-And finally―finally, restore her kingdom back to it's once glory, or better yet, make it even more remarkable then it ever was."
1192,0,"Simple right? Ooh no, far from it!! Elisa's journey will be horrendous as it takes her all across neighboring kingdoms and back, fighting enemy's and supposed allies at every turn. But Elisa is steadfast on completing her 5 goals before all is lost to them all. She is their Queen, and their born savior, and she will not give up until all is saved, until her kingdom is back in good graces, no matter the sacrifices, she will endure them all..."
1193,0,"THE BITTER KINGDOM went above and beyond the limits I expected, and though it didn't end the way I thought, it still rocked this series to the very core and has me eagerly anticipating more from Rae Carson. Because this woman is brilliant, and truly has the special gift of creating magical worlds that not only draws the reader in, but also invest them into her world and wonderfully characters, that satisfies in more ways then one."
1194,0,"Overall, THE BITTER KINGDOM is a thrilling conclusion that is not to be missed. This whole series is wonderful and will go down as one of my favorite series of all time!! If you're looking for an epic adventure though enemy lands, and a battle to save a kingdom with magical elements, and a bitter sweet romance, then THE BITTER KINGDOM and the complete series is definitely for you!!"
1195,0,Like maybe from a critical stand point this should be a slight bit lower but gosh I have so much love for this book and this series and these characters that I don't even care. 😭
1196,0,"I have not fallen in love with characters like this and been so I vested in relationships since reading Throne of Glass and Six of Crows. I'm acting like I read these years ago but you know, what ever. 😂 Like a fat, person of color main character who learns how to become the most confident and badass woman out there?? I just have no words. Thinking about Elisa makes me feel so empowered."
1197,0,There's so many more amazing quotes and scenes in this last installment. So many precious and beautiful moments between Elisa and Hector and even more incredible character development. Like that scene of there first time just had me crying.
1198,0,"""It wasn't perfection, but it was perfect."""
1199,0,This isn't even a coherent review but basically all you need to know is that this is an absolutely incredible series that everyone needs to read This is definitely going on the list of favorite series of mine. 😍
1200,0,"While 4 stars is not a bad rating, The Bitter Kingdom fell short in a series that, for me, showed amazing promise - I gave a 6-star rating to The Crown of Embers, the second novel of this trilogy!"
1201,0,"I was disappointed with how Rae Carson wrapped up the story about Elisa, her Godstone and her act of service. It felt anti-climatic to me. After reading the second novel, I thought I had a grasp on the concept of a Godstone, but now I'm not so sure. Is a Godstone truly a direct link between the bearer and God or is it something else entirely?"
1202,0,"Carson did such a wonderful job of building up Elisa and Hector's relationship in the first two novels. It was the perfect combination of angsty and sweet. But, I felt the magic between our couple was lost in The Bitter Kingdom."
1203,0,"I'm longing for more story about Rosario and Red, Storm and Alodia, Mara and Belen, even the future of Joya D'Arena, but the series is now complete. I truly hope Rae Carson will consider writing more story in Fire and Thorns world. She is a fantastic storyteller! Overall, I still believe The Bitter Kingdom deserves a 4-star rating, with the overall series rating being 5 stars!"
1204,0,Being the last installment of the trilogy I was pleasantly surprised by how much it grew as a book from its predecessors. I really enjoyed this one more then I thought I would. It improved in places where I needed it to improve for me and also was a lot more entertaining to me. I also would like to point out that I loved how this book added a dual perspective but only when it was necessary. We got so much more magic system and world building in this book. I am just sad that it came so late and at the end of the series because had it came before I might have loved this series more but alas that is not the case. I did feel the ending was a little anticlimactic as is somewhat usual in YA finales but it still wrapped up nicely. I highly enjoyed my time with this series and am finally glad I got around to it.

1209,0,"Even though I feel my words will be woefully inadequate, it is really important for me to be able to review The Bitter Kingdom. I don’t want any other fellow fantasy fans out there missing out on such an incredible trilogy any longer (which is what I did for years until just last month). The Bitter Kingdom is one of the best series enders I’ve read - rich in details, satisfactory conclusions per plot point… and still contains a thrilling adventure, treasured friendships and a swoony romance."
1210,0,"If The Girl of Fire and Thorns lit my fangirl fire, and The Crown of Embers coaxed roaring flames out of it, then The Bitter Kingdom kept it steadily aflame. It tells the next part of Elisa’s story, which is full of higher stakes, unexpected sacrifices and dangerous exploits. Like its predecessors, the novel is well-written, with just the right amount of flourish to provide lush details even while remaining fairly easy to read."
1211,0,"The Bitter Kingdom takes everything readers have come to know about Elisa (including her destiny and duty), these characters, this world and the raging conflict in it and brings us to its fantastic conclusion. Though I might have been able to guess how things would go, it was easy to decide to simply just enjoy the ride and go where the words would take me. Carson’s writing is so easy to get lost in – and doing that was probably the reason my overall experience of the series was fantastic."
1212,0,"Elisa is a complete badass in The Bitter Kingdom. Gone is the girl from the very beginning of The Girl of Fire and Thorns, the one filled with uncertainty and fear, and found comfort in food and the familiar. A warrior, a queen, a mage – this is the girl that has taken her place. It was hard not to break out into applause and hollers of appreciation while witnessing all her deeds. It was a treat to see her in command, of herself and her kingdom. Carson allowed Elisa’s character development to unfold organically throughout the series, and it culminates here beautifully."
1213,0,"Elisa’s relationships (especially with her little crew of Mara, Belen, Storm and eventually, Mula/Red and Hector) are a key element of The Bitter Kingdom. It’s simply nice to see Elisa have friends she can rely on, who will tease her, advise her, protect her and stand by her. The clear affection and regard they have for one another is admirable and enviable."
1214,0,"Of course, there’s something more than friendship between Elisa and Hector. By the end of The Crown of Embers, these two are head over heels in love, but kept apart by duty, propriety and actual physical separation. I am seriously in love with this romance! Carson knows exactly how to make it work, taking a two steps forward-one step back approach that leaves readers wanting more. Readers should prepare for a whole lot of swooning, as the romance is entirely too epic to avoid doing so!"
1215,0,"But Fire and Thorns is about Elisa’s journey. I loved that it was her individual journey that truly mattered. It was never buried or forgotten, and wound up being the primary aspect that carried the story along."
1216,0,"The Bitter Kingdom is a beautiful ending to the epic Fire and Thorns series. The story that began with Elisa’s wedding in The Girl of Fire and Thorns comes full circle here, with a satisfying, believable conclusion. It was an incredible journey to be a part of! Rae Carson has written a series that I will definitely be revisiting in the future. If you have yet to read this series, please take my word for it and JUST DO IT."
1217,0,"This is the third and concluding volume of the series. Elisa is on the run and is facing the threat from her enemies who have captured her love, Hector. In order to save him and her kingdom, which is now under the threat of civil war, Elisa embarks on a dangerous and challenging journey, making bold alliances along the way and traveling both over land and underground through a series of mines holding deadly traps at each turn. The almost non-stop adventures lead to a brave and bold conclusion where Elisa uses her strategic mind to come up with an intriguing plan to save the kingdom. Along the way, we learn more about the Godstone and the history behind the people of her world."
1218,0,"This was quite an enjoyable trilogy. I liked the adventure in this volume, the nonstop action and the introduction of the character Red, who deserves her own book series. I also like the inversion on the usual hero-rescues princess trope, with the princess in the beginning setting out to rescue her romantic interest. I wasn't thrilled with some of the revelations about the Inviernos, which seemed to come from out of nowhere and without enough build-up. Also, I thought the message at the end about learning to love oneself was laid on a little too thick, to the point of being eyeroll-inducing. It's possible, I think, to have a strong theme in a story without throwing it in our faces. Up until now the series did an excellent job of it. Ms. Carson should trust her narrative to get the point across on its own, without having to scream it from the mountaintops in the last chapter."
1219,0,"The Bitter Kingdom for me ended up being more about finishing out the series, rather than me being pulled into the story. There were aspects to this final installment that I enjoyed: the friendships, seeing Elisa become a stronger character (in some respects), Storms addition to the group, and Mula, who added a bit of humor to the story at times. The romance between Elisa and Hector builds up in this one. While at points I enjoyed their romance, in other respects it was also a bit disappointing too."
1220,0,"Large parts of the story are of course their hardships through enemy territory and such. I will admit I ended up skim reading through some sections of the novel. The story was still well written, it just did not grab me like the first one or even the second."
1221,0,"*Note, while the novel remains a clean read. There are a few fade to black scenes."
1222,0,"From desert to snow, Rae Carson has delivered an epic fantasy series that encompasses dangerous terrain and is fully satisfying, gripping, and thrilling. Appropriately named THE BITTER KINGDOM on many levels, picking up the final novel for the first time left a bitter taste in my mouth. This book broke my heart--in all the best ways. Over the course of the series, Rae Carson has gotten better and better. Each book exceeds the last. Even her e-novellas have depth and merit, well worth your $2.99. Carson has become one of my favorite high fantasy authors, and I'm already anticipating a new series by her. I'm devastated that the series has ended; it's like I've lost a cherished best friend. The series ends on a high note, and if you haven't yet made the leap, I envy you. Seriously, I envy you. You get to read these amazing books for the first time. One of my friends is reading the first book now on my suggestion, and it makes me so envious. I seriously want to cry every time I think about the fact that I'm finished this series. I feel so barren without it in my life! Thank goodness for the ability to re-read!"

1225,0,.***
1226,0,"Elisa has come so far and changed  a great deal over the course of the series. She's gone from being a whiny princess who sits around and eats non-stop without a care in the world to a young queen willing to risk everything in order to protect her loved ones and an entire kingdom. With the way THE CROWN OF EMBERS ended, I thought THE BITTER KINGDOM would revolve around the rescue of Hector, and while it begins that way, it's not the true purpose of the novel. Characters continue to work together and aid one another in ways that make me admire Carson even more, and the plot is richer and fuller than I imagined it could be. Everything comes full circle, and while new questions are raised in unexpected ways (I would love a companion series centuries in the future that pick up on the fruition of Elisa's Purpose), nothing is left hanging. The resolutions are satisfying and make me both happy and sad--happy because the book is just so good, and sad because...this journey is over. I still can't quite comprehend that; I'm pretty sure I'm in withdrawal. I already need to re-read this series and have been sitting on the final novella!"
1227,0,"I don't want to give anything about the plot away, but it amazes me to see the way Carson opens up new characters. We explore villains and their motivations. We learn a bit about their culture. We have gone from steaming hot deserts to frigid, snow-capped mountains. The journey is more sparse this time around; you can tell in the lack of food description alone! Elisa and company have endured so much over the course of the series, and will suffer through even more before encountering destiny."
1228,0,"Carson is incredibly gifted at writing. Small decisions become monumental and make you stop and savor/reflect, only to be followed by moments of humor to make the emotions dissipate. She is queen at playing with reader emotions. Elisa is such a strong female role model, and it's great to see a girl kicking butt and saving the guy for once--especially when he's okay with that! So refreshing. And Hector...how I adore Hector. He has to be a favorite of mine. When I re-read THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS before reading THE CROWN OF EMBERS for the first time, I saw a hint of something, but I wasn't sure until later in TCOE...much as I was rooting for it to be the case. After everything Elisa has endured, she deserves happiness and true love, and Hector is just right for her. I've even fallen in love with secondary characters from the series, however, and it's like they've all become close friends. You understand what makes them tick and what they care about. This deepens upon reading the e-novellas, though they're not necessary to the main plot. I can't say it enough: Carson is superb at character development."
1229,0,"There's a lot of gushing in this review, and little summary, since there are so many spoilers by now. I apologize. I love this series so much, though, and if you haven't read it or finished (Hey, I wasn't in True Love on my first go-round, either! Just in Serious Like) yet, you owe it to yourself to give the Fire and Thorns Trilogy a genuine chance...especially since you have a chance to win the whole series below!"
1230,0,"Elisa's reign as queen has never been easy, but in the final installment of the Girl of Fire and Thorns saga, Rae Carson gives us and ending so epic, it will give you shivers. The Bitter Kingdom is a conclusion like no other."
1231,0,"Elisa has suffered through being married off to a man she had never met for political reasons, the loss of a husband she had just come to appreciate, being kidnapped, the loss of a man she loved, assassination attempts, and now attacks upon her kingdom. As a foreign-born queen, Elisa must do more to prove to her people she can protect them. As the Invierno sorcerers finish their attack on her city, she escapes, but not before her beloved guard Hector is kidnapped. Determined to find Hector, Elisa and a trusted group of loyal friends head off through the mountains and desert to find the man she loves."
1232,0,"Along the way, Elisa realizes she has tapped into the power of her Godstone through the discovery of a source of power. Storm, the Invierno traitor turned loyal subject, works with Elisa to hone her powers. While she knew she had grown since her original marriage as a plump, bored princess, she had no idea just how much has truly grown. As one of the most powerful animagus to ever live, she knows she now has the power to protect her kingdom from the Inviernos and their magic. But it is her fearless nature and determination to protect her people that is the true force to be reckoned with. People may underestimate Elisa, but that is just one more thing in her favor, because if they underestimate her, they will never see it coming when she follows through on all her plans."
1233,0,"I have absolutely loved this story from the first book to the last. Carson wove a web of stories that were so intricate and so engaging that you simply couldn't stop reading. There was no sophomore slump throughout the series, and the ending? Don't expect any downtime here! This story was action-packed from the first page to the last. With the exception of about 5 pages at the end to give us an epilogue with information on how life turned out for everyone, this book just didn't release its vice grip on you until you were done! If you are the kind of reader who needs to be engaged from start to finish, this really is the series for you. Not a dull moment to be found!"
1234,0,"I have said this before, with Carson's previous books, but I will say it again. There is something so incredible about Elisa that she really has to be one of my absolute favorite heroines in all the books I have read. She is strong, she won't be broken, she doesn't scare easily, and if she does, she uses that fear to take back what is hers and find a way to resolve any solution with as few casualties as possible. I love the fact that her body is constantly discussed as well. You would think this should be something inconsequential, but there is something so important about a heroine who lived a life of pleasure, who didn't fit the ""princess mold"" in terms of her body type, and who still rose to the occasion and defied all expectations. And even when she slimmed down, she was still built differently. People commented on it and made snide comments, but Elisa used their derision to catch them off guard. It was fabulous! But it was her ability to negotiate and see the big picture that made Elisa so successful and made me truly love her."
1235,0,"The supporting characters are just as dynamic as Elisa. Mula, the slave girl they rescue on their travels, is so funny, loyal, and appreciative that you can't help but love her! She drives them all nuts with her candidness, but that is what I love the most about her! She just tells it like it is! Then there is Storm, the Invierno traitor who became Elisa's ambassador and finally her loyal subject. Inviernos are described as a primitive race who were there before Elisa's ancestors ""descended"" and began taking over. Unfortunately, there isn't much information past this tidbit, but the Inviernos clearly despise anyone who isn't their kind. They also can't lie. In fact, trying to get a straight answer reminds me of trying to get a straight answer out of a faerie, as described in other novels. They can't lie, but they are more than happy to trick, mislead, and deceive. That is Storm. And his people. So his blunt honesty can be humorous or unwelcomed, but it is who Storm is! And while he drives everyone else nuts, Elisa is protective over the strange man. And his loyalty to her is matched only by her other traveling companions."
1236,0,"This was just such a special story full of magic, sorcerers, strong ladies, and the lands they will die to protect. If you have any student who loves a little fantasy and needs a fabulous story to keep them interested, look no further. You have found it. As a conclusion, this was a fabulous way to wrap up a story I have followed since the first book was released. I loved it so much, I can't even find the right words to describe it! I think the beautiful complexity matched with the simplistic strength of the story will appeal to young adults as well as adult readers. And Ms. Carson? You had better be working on something new, because I cannot wait too long without something more from you!"
1237,0,"Vol. 2 of 3K touched me in a special way. Vol. 1 was a good appetizer. Vol. 2 is the main course. I enjoyed It especially because it gave me insights into people who I experience in daily life. Liu Bei got his vision of who he was from being a descendant of political leaders. His work experience was only as a maker of straw sandals, but his vision of who he is, is based on his ancestors. To him, this qualified him to be the Emperor of China. We all know that character traits can genetically be passed from one generation to another. Often character traits skip a generation and appear in a second or third generation person. His inheritance opened the doorway to a place of possible political leadership."
1238,0," Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei's senior Advisor, is the ultimate networker. The fact that he was a person of wisdom enabled him to come up with ideas and schemes. With these qualities he was able, through networking, to be able to overcome great challenges. He was not wealthy nor did he carry a weapon other than his ability to wisely advise. Amazing."
1239,0," Liu Bei's ultimate challenger, his nemesis, was Cao Cao whose ability was to charge forward with great energy in an aggressive way. Often he seems ruthless in his efforts, but this is the way of the person who obsessively charges onward to achieve his goals."
1240,0, Sun Quan seems like a person who finds himself promoted into a position that is really beyond his skills and talents. He relies on advisors and skillful supporters to maintain his position.
1241,0, It is easy to relate these main characters in Three Kingdom to people we meet and deal with today. This book gives me insight into dealing with people I deal with in everyday life.
1242,0, This version of Three Kingdoms was an easy read. All the Chinese names and places quickly began to confuse me however the list of main characters and who they were listed at the front of the book was a big help in getting through the exciting events written in this book.
1243,0,If you are going to start reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms then you should start with this book series. This edition is more coherent and well put together with footnotes at the bottom and end of each chapter. There is a character list in the beginning with brief descriptions. The names and places are spelled/pronounced more accurately. This series is a MUST for any fan of classical literature.
1244,0,"A new character was introduced at the conclusion of volume 1 who was to play a critical role in this epic adventure. Serendipity comes to Liu Bei in volume 2 as the new character becomes his advisor. The new character leads Liu Bei to military success over Cao Cao’s forces with clever winning strategies. However, the twist in the plot a few pages later reveals the perils of deceit and cunning to which Cao Cao is capable."
1245,0,"Incidents like this seem to mirror real life today; what seems like bad luck actually becomes good luck. In this situation the loss of his wise advisor opens an opportunity for Liu Bei. The advisor, as he is leaving, makes a recommendation to Liu Bei that will change the dynamics of all that has come before. We gather from the sequence of events to follow a whole new range of exciting strategies and episodes, filled with surprises."
1246,0,Best translation that I have of the series. I have 4 different ones. Very happy with this book.
1247,0,Stunning world literature! Excellent translation.
1248,0,good
1249,0,Absolutely love them
1250,0,My 14 yo son read this book in one night.  He loves these kinds of novels.
1251,0,"A great followup to volume 1. Well-written translation, epic story..."
1252,0,5 Stars
1253,0,"Magically enchanting, and wonderfully addicting, THE BITTER KINGDOM delivers an explosive conclusion that will leave you breathless and yearning for more!!! From it's rich lure of fantasy blend, and it's thickened plot, to it's breathtakingly hypnotic romance, and non-stop action and adventure, and magical background that solidifies this series to it's fullest. THE BITTER KINGDOM was one hell of a finale that I am utterly satisfied with, but drastically needing more..."
1254,0,"I am speechless after reading THE BITTER KINGDOM. I feel like my feelings are all jumbled and no words I can form will do it nearly any justice. There are no words to express the full depth and love I have for this book--no series. This series is one of those series that will stay with me for a very long time. And I'm saddened to see it all end, as I still want more from these characters and this world. But either way I still really enjoyed the way this series ended, even though at the same time it felt incomplete. But it doesn't really matter because it was an EPIC journey though it all!!"
1255,0,"Like I said above, this book ended great, it was absolutely wonderful. But, I still did feel that their were still too many unanswered questions that were left open at the close of this series. And it kept picking at me long after this book was over. It felt like it wasn't the end of the series and that another book would follow. It just didn't wrap up as good as I hoped it would have. I would of liked to see how some of the side charters ended up after the battle was all said and done. I guess I just wanted more from the epilogue, and to see how things fared after the main plot was played out. BUT nevertheless, it still delivered in more ways then one, and has stole my heart and branded it's world forever in my soul."
1256,0,"The writing was as elegant and suspenseful as ever, and the characters had so much growth and development that it was heart-warming to see the strength they were able to pull from each other through all their struggles. I loved watching them through each book as they went through and endured each obstacles that tested them to their fullest, and were able to find the strength and endurance at each turn to overcome their predicaments and become stronger and more determined then ever!"
1257,0,THE PLOT
1258,0,"Elisa has failed her kingdom, and now she's paying the price for that failure..."
1259,0,"Betrayed by supposed allies in her most trusted circle, Elisa is now hunted, a wanted fugitive in her own kingdom. Hiding amongst her own people, trying to blend in and cope with the capture of the captain of her guard and the man she's slowly came to love. Elisa can't possibly imagine it getting anymore complicated, but boy is she wrong. It's about to become a sandstorm of madness..."
1260,0,ELISA HAS 5 GOALS:
1261,0,"1-Free her beloved Hector before he makes to Invierne in enemy hands, and surfers a fate unimaginable. 2-Safely enter the City of Invierne and stop the impending war that's on their way to her kingdoms doorstep. 3-Meet with the neighboring kingdoms Queens, her sister Alodia, and her good friend Cosmé, to forge a health alliance and hopefully join their kingdoms. 4-Stop civil war from tearing her kingdom apart at the hands of the fellow Quorum Lord Eduardo, before it's to late. 5-And finally―finally, restore her kingdom back to it's once glory, or better yet, make it even more remarkable then it ever was."
1262,0,"Simple right? Ooh no, far from it!! Elisa's journey will be horrendous as it takes her all across neighboring kingdoms and back, fighting enemy's and supposed allies at every turn. But Elisa is steadfast on completing her 5 goals before all is lost to them all. She is their Queen, and their born savior, and she will not give up until all is saved, until her kingdom is back in good graces, no matter the sacrifices, she will endure them all..."
1263,0,"THE BITTER KINGDOM went above and beyond the limits I expected, and though it didn't end the way I thought, it still rocked this series to the very core and has me eagerly anticipating more from Rae Carson. Because this woman is brilliant, and truly has the special gift of creating magical worlds that not only draws the reader in, but also invest them into her world and wonderfully characters, that satisfies in more ways then one."
1264,0,"Overall, THE BITTER KINGDOM is a thrilling conclusion that is not to be missed. This whole series is wonderful and will go down as one of my favorite series of all time!! If you're looking for an epic adventure though enemy lands, and a battle to save a kingdom with magical elements, and a bitter sweet romance, then THE BITTER KINGDOM and the complete series is definitely for you!!"
1265,0,Like maybe from a critical stand point this should be a slight bit lower but gosh I have so much love for this book and this series and these characters that I don't even care. 😭
1266,0,"I have not fallen in love with characters like this and been so I vested in relationships since reading Throne of Glass and Six of Crows. I'm acting like I read these years ago but you know, what ever. 😂 Like a fat, person of color main character who learns how to become the most confident and badass woman out there?? I just have no words. Thinking about Elisa makes me feel so empowered."
1267,0,There's so many more amazing quotes and scenes in this last installment. So many precious and beautiful moments between Elisa and Hector and even more incredible character development. Like that scene of there first time just had me crying.
1268,0,"""It wasn't perfection, but it was perfect."""
1269,0,This isn't even a coherent review but basically all you need to know is that this is an absolutely incredible series that everyone needs to read This is definitely going on the list of favorite series of mine. 😍
1270,0,"While 4 stars is not a bad rating, The Bitter Kingdom fell short in a series that, for me, showed amazing promise - I gave a 6-star rating to The Crown of Embers, the second novel of this trilogy!"
1271,0,"I was disappointed with how Rae Carson wrapped up the story about Elisa, her Godstone and her act of service. It felt anti-climatic to me. After reading the second novel, I thought I had a grasp on the concept of a Godstone, but now I'm not so sure. Is a Godstone truly a direct link between the bearer and God or is it something else entirely?"
1272,0,"Carson did such a wonderful job of building up Elisa and Hector's relationship in the first two novels. It was the perfect combination of angsty and sweet. But, I felt the magic between our couple was lost in The Bitter Kingdom."
1273,0,"I'm longing for more story about Rosario and Red, Storm and Alodia, Mara and Belen, even the future of Joya D'Arena, but the series is now complete. I truly hope Rae Carson will consider writing more story in Fire and Thorns world. She is a fantastic storyteller! Overall, I still believe The Bitter Kingdom deserves a 4-star rating, with the overall series rating being 5 stars!"
1274,0,Being the last installment of the trilogy I was pleasantly surprised by how much it grew as a book from its predecessors. I really enjoyed this one more then I thought I would. It improved in places where I needed it to improve for me and also was a lot more entertaining to me. I also would like to point out that I loved how this book added a dual perspective but only when it was necessary. We got so much more magic system and world building in this book. I am just sad that it came so late and at the end of the series because had it came before I might have loved this series more but alas that is not the case. I did feel the ending was a little anticlimactic as is somewhat usual in YA finales but it still wrapped up nicely. I highly enjoyed my time with this series and am finally glad I got around to it.

1279,0,"Even though I feel my words will be woefully inadequate, it is really important for me to be able to review The Bitter Kingdom. I don’t want any other fellow fantasy fans out there missing out on such an incredible trilogy any longer (which is what I did for years until just last month). The Bitter Kingdom is one of the best series enders I’ve read - rich in details, satisfactory conclusions per plot point… and still contains a thrilling adventure, treasured friendships and a swoony romance."
1280,0,"If The Girl of Fire and Thorns lit my fangirl fire, and The Crown of Embers coaxed roaring flames out of it, then The Bitter Kingdom kept it steadily aflame. It tells the next part of Elisa’s story, which is full of higher stakes, unexpected sacrifices and dangerous exploits. Like its predecessors, the novel is well-written, with just the right amount of flourish to provide lush details even while remaining fairly easy to read."
1281,0,"The Bitter Kingdom takes everything readers have come to know about Elisa (including her destiny and duty), these characters, this world and the raging conflict in it and brings us to its fantastic conclusion. Though I might have been able to guess how things would go, it was easy to decide to simply just enjoy the ride and go where the words would take me. Carson’s writing is so easy to get lost in – and doing that was probably the reason my overall experience of the series was fantastic."
1282,0,"Elisa is a complete badass in The Bitter Kingdom. Gone is the girl from the very beginning of The Girl of Fire and Thorns, the one filled with uncertainty and fear, and found comfort in food and the familiar. A warrior, a queen, a mage – this is the girl that has taken her place. It was hard not to break out into applause and hollers of appreciation while witnessing all her deeds. It was a treat to see her in command, of herself and her kingdom. Carson allowed Elisa’s character development to unfold organically throughout the series, and it culminates here beautifully."
1283,0,"Elisa’s relationships (especially with her little crew of Mara, Belen, Storm and eventually, Mula/Red and Hector) are a key element of The Bitter Kingdom. It’s simply nice to see Elisa have friends she can rely on, who will tease her, advise her, protect her and stand by her. The clear affection and regard they have for one another is admirable and enviable."
1284,0,"Of course, there’s something more than friendship between Elisa and Hector. By the end of The Crown of Embers, these two are head over heels in love, but kept apart by duty, propriety and actual physical separation. I am seriously in love with this romance! Carson knows exactly how to make it work, taking a two steps forward-one step back approach that leaves readers wanting more. Readers should prepare for a whole lot of swooning, as the romance is entirely too epic to avoid doing so!"
1285,0,"But Fire and Thorns is about Elisa’s journey. I loved that it was her individual journey that truly mattered. It was never buried or forgotten, and wound up being the primary aspect that carried the story along."
1286,0,"The Bitter Kingdom is a beautiful ending to the epic Fire and Thorns series. The story that began with Elisa’s wedding in The Girl of Fire and Thorns comes full circle here, with a satisfying, believable conclusion. It was an incredible journey to be a part of! Rae Carson has written a series that I will definitely be revisiting in the future. If you have yet to read this series, please take my word for it and JUST DO IT."
1287,0,"This is the third and concluding volume of the series. Elisa is on the run and is facing the threat from her enemies who have captured her love, Hector. In order to save him and her kingdom, which is now under the threat of civil war, Elisa embarks on a dangerous and challenging journey, making bold alliances along the way and traveling both over land and underground through a series of mines holding deadly traps at each turn. The almost non-stop adventures lead to a brave and bold conclusion where Elisa uses her strategic mind to come up with an intriguing plan to save the kingdom. Along the way, we learn more about the Godstone and the history behind the people of her world."
1288,0,"This was quite an enjoyable trilogy. I liked the adventure in this volume, the nonstop action and the introduction of the character Red, who deserves her own book series. I also like the inversion on the usual hero-rescues princess trope, with the princess in the beginning setting out to rescue her romantic interest. I wasn't thrilled with some of the revelations about the Inviernos, which seemed to come from out of nowhere and without enough build-up. Also, I thought the message at the end about learning to love oneself was laid on a little too thick, to the point of being eyeroll-inducing. It's possible, I think, to have a strong theme in a story without throwing it in our faces. Up until now the series did an excellent job of it. Ms. Carson should trust her narrative to get the point across on its own, without having to scream it from the mountaintops in the last chapter."
1289,0,"The Bitter Kingdom for me ended up being more about finishing out the series, rather than me being pulled into the story. There were aspects to this final installment that I enjoyed: the friendships, seeing Elisa become a stronger character (in some respects), Storms addition to the group, and Mula, who added a bit of humor to the story at times. The romance between Elisa and Hector builds up in this one. While at points I enjoyed their romance, in other respects it was also a bit disappointing too."
1290,0,"Large parts of the story are of course their hardships through enemy territory and such. I will admit I ended up skim reading through some sections of the novel. The story was still well written, it just did not grab me like the first one or even the second."
1291,0,"*Note, while the novel remains a clean read. There are a few fade to black scenes."
1292,0,"From desert to snow, Rae Carson has delivered an epic fantasy series that encompasses dangerous terrain and is fully satisfying, gripping, and thrilling. Appropriately named THE BITTER KINGDOM on many levels, picking up the final novel for the first time left a bitter taste in my mouth. This book broke my heart--in all the best ways. Over the course of the series, Rae Carson has gotten better and better. Each book exceeds the last. Even her e-novellas have depth and merit, well worth your $2.99. Carson has become one of my favorite high fantasy authors, and I'm already anticipating a new series by her. I'm devastated that the series has ended; it's like I've lost a cherished best friend. The series ends on a high note, and if you haven't yet made the leap, I envy you. Seriously, I envy you. You get to read these amazing books for the first time. One of my friends is reading the first book now on my suggestion, and it makes me so envious. I seriously want to cry every time I think about the fact that I'm finished this series. I feel so barren without it in my life! Thank goodness for the ability to re-read!"

1295,0,.***
1296,0,"Elisa has come so far and changed  a great deal over the course of the series. She's gone from being a whiny princess who sits around and eats non-stop without a care in the world to a young queen willing to risk everything in order to protect her loved ones and an entire kingdom. With the way THE CROWN OF EMBERS ended, I thought THE BITTER KINGDOM would revolve around the rescue of Hector, and while it begins that way, it's not the true purpose of the novel. Characters continue to work together and aid one another in ways that make me admire Carson even more, and the plot is richer and fuller than I imagined it could be. Everything comes full circle, and while new questions are raised in unexpected ways (I would love a companion series centuries in the future that pick up on the fruition of Elisa's Purpose), nothing is left hanging. The resolutions are satisfying and make me both happy and sad--happy because the book is just so good, and sad because...this journey is over. I still can't quite comprehend that; I'm pretty sure I'm in withdrawal. I already need to re-read this series and have been sitting on the final novella!"
1297,0,"I don't want to give anything about the plot away, but it amazes me to see the way Carson opens up new characters. We explore villains and their motivations. We learn a bit about their culture. We have gone from steaming hot deserts to frigid, snow-capped mountains. The journey is more sparse this time around; you can tell in the lack of food description alone! Elisa and company have endured so much over the course of the series, and will suffer through even more before encountering destiny."
1298,0,"Carson is incredibly gifted at writing. Small decisions become monumental and make you stop and savor/reflect, only to be followed by moments of humor to make the emotions dissipate. She is queen at playing with reader emotions. Elisa is such a strong female role model, and it's great to see a girl kicking butt and saving the guy for once--especially when he's okay with that! So refreshing. And Hector...how I adore Hector. He has to be a favorite of mine. When I re-read THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS before reading THE CROWN OF EMBERS for the first time, I saw a hint of something, but I wasn't sure until later in TCOE...much as I was rooting for it to be the case. After everything Elisa has endured, she deserves happiness and true love, and Hector is just right for her. I've even fallen in love with secondary characters from the series, however, and it's like they've all become close friends. You understand what makes them tick and what they care about. This deepens upon reading the e-novellas, though they're not necessary to the main plot. I can't say it enough: Carson is superb at character development."
1299,0,"There's a lot of gushing in this review, and little summary, since there are so many spoilers by now. I apologize. I love this series so much, though, and if you haven't read it or finished (Hey, I wasn't in True Love on my first go-round, either! Just in Serious Like) yet, you owe it to yourself to give the Fire and Thorns Trilogy a genuine chance...especially since you have a chance to win the whole series below!"
1300,0,"Elisa's reign as queen has never been easy, but in the final installment of the Girl of Fire and Thorns saga, Rae Carson gives us and ending so epic, it will give you shivers. The Bitter Kingdom is a conclusion like no other."
1301,0,"Elisa has suffered through being married off to a man she had never met for political reasons, the loss of a husband she had just come to appreciate, being kidnapped, the loss of a man she loved, assassination attempts, and now attacks upon her kingdom. As a foreign-born queen, Elisa must do more to prove to her people she can protect them. As the Invierno sorcerers finish their attack on her city, she escapes, but not before her beloved guard Hector is kidnapped. Determined to find Hector, Elisa and a trusted group of loyal friends head off through the mountains and desert to find the man she loves."
1302,0,"Along the way, Elisa realizes she has tapped into the power of her Godstone through the discovery of a source of power. Storm, the Invierno traitor turned loyal subject, works with Elisa to hone her powers. While she knew she had grown since her original marriage as a plump, bored princess, she had no idea just how much has truly grown. As one of the most powerful animagus to ever live, she knows she now has the power to protect her kingdom from the Inviernos and their magic. But it is her fearless nature and determination to protect her people that is the true force to be reckoned with. People may underestimate Elisa, but that is just one more thing in her favor, because if they underestimate her, they will never see it coming when she follows through on all her plans."
1303,0,"I have absolutely loved this story from the first book to the last. Carson wove a web of stories that were so intricate and so engaging that you simply couldn't stop reading.

If you are the kind of reader who needs to be engaged from start to finish, this really is the series for you. Not a dull moment to be found!"
1304,0,"I have said this before, with Carson's previous books, but I will say it again. There is something so incredible about Elisa that she really has to be one of my absolute favorite heroines in all the books I have read. She is strong, she won't be broken, she doesn't scare easily, and if she does, she uses that fear to take back what is hers and find a way to resolve any solution with as few casualties as possible.

She drives them all nuts with her candidness, but that is what I love the most about her! She just tells it like it is!

I think the beautiful complexity matched with the simplistic strength of the story will appeal to young adults as well as adult readers. And Ms. Carson? You had better be working on something new, because I cannot wait too long without something more from you!"
1307,0,"Caution: Although it is listed as a different version of the same product, the $3.99 Kindle edition is literally a comic book version of this.  The page is misleading, as it lists Moss as the translator and the length as 1120 pages.  When you download the eBook, you get a 71 page comic book. I was able to return for a refund, but this absolutely NOT what the page would lead you to believe."
1308,0,"I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for ""Journey to the West"" and ""Outlaws of the Marsh"".  I tried a different translation for ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" done by Brewitt-Talyor as well."
1309,0,I prefer the Moss Robert's version because:
1310,0,1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others)
1311,0,"2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class"
1312,0,3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version
1313,0,"Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period."
1314,0,"The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads."
1315,0,"If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms."
1316,0,"FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor."
1317,0,"I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well."
1318,0,"It's a challenging read for those of us who didn't grow up with these characters and stories, but if you invest the time and make good use of the excellent Moss Roberts annotations, you can get completely absorbed in it. After working at it for a while, picking it up and putting it down and picking it up again, all of a sudden, I discovered that this monster of a novel turns out to be the source material for many of my favorite Chinese movies. In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself."
1319,0,"If you want to understand Chinese strategy read this. Research has shown we are influenced heavily by the stories of our childhood. The Three Kingdoms is a well known tale in China, not so much in the rest of the world. If you want to understand Chinese strategy, negotiation and leadership - look at the examples that children were taught in this book."
1320,0,Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:
1321,0,"""Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."""
1322,0,Compare this with Taylor's translation:
1323,0,"""Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity."""
1324,0,Or Hegel's:
1325,0,"""Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce."""
1326,0,"It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator."
1327,0,"In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire."
1328,0,"It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the ""Three Kingdoms"" of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together."
1329,0,"For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience."
1330,0,"The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map."
1331,0,"The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's ""just"" entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history."
1332,0,"A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.)"
1333,0,"Despite these caveats, ""Three Kingdoms"" is a work worthy of your time."
1334,0,"Bought the digital version for a cheap price of $4. Story quality is fine, the technical aspects make it hard to read."
1335,0,"It only shows one panel at a time, at low resolution. The Kindle PC app doesn't allow maximizing and justifying so the panels are like 2"" in size. I had to manually reduce windows resolution very low as a workaround. Using a surface for vertical aspect ratio doesn't help much either."
1336,0,"The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment."
1337,0,Pros:
1338,0,- This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight.
1339,0,"- Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang."
1340,0,Cons:
1341,0,The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves.
1342,0,- There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before.
1343,0,"- The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine. I've read through my volumes three times, and they're still in very good shape."
1344,0,***This review is based on a discovery made when attempting to start reading the book***
1345,0,"The annotations & footnotes for Volume 1 are stored in the back of Volume 2. So if you care about any of these, which there are A TON, you need to buy the second book & lug it around with you. Which these books are not small or light by any means."
1346,0,No where in the book itself or on this store page does it mention the appendix being in the other volume. I had to dig around online til i saw this briefly mentioned in a review for vol. 2
1347,0,"Great book, although I should mention a complaint with Amazon for using bubble wrap. I couldn't return it because I was going overseas within a day, and it was simply too much hassle. The book arrived damaged, because bubble wrap doesn't protect the book. However, they have accepted my complaint, and agreed to a replacement (Thankyou!)"
1348,0,"The book itself is a classic, and this is a good translation, although I want the one that starts: ""They say the momentum of history was ever thus: the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide."" That is surely one of the greatest openings in all of literature; this one isn't quite at that level. I think that version might be adapted from Moss Roberts (the same translator as this book), or it may be his earlier, abridged version."
1349,0,"This is one of the four classical chinese novels, and if you are looking to connect with the Middle Kingdom and its past, this is a great (though rather heavy) place to start."
1350,0,"I really love this piece.  It looks authentic and like the bronze they are normally made of.  I would have given 5 stars rather than 4 stars but when I received the statue, the blade of the Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade was broke off.  I simply glued it back on and it is just fine.  This was packaged in a wrap around Styrofoam so it was protected well."
1351,0,Broken product has been reported but no response...
1352,0,"I absolutely love this warrior! As soon as I looked at it I knew I had to have it and I am sure glad I ordered it. Not only was it delivered fast, Four Days!!! Unbelievably fast delivery for FREE!!! Wow! but it was packaged to withstand an earthquake! The item is of great quality and well made. It has a good weight and the paint used makes it an eye catcher. Love everything about my experience purchasing and receiving this warrior and I feel like it was money well spent."
1353,0,"The Legends From China series comic and text version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the four great classics of Chinese literature, is a masterpiece of (relatively) simple storytelling, with great visuals. The only confusing point at times is the similarity in appearance of the many, many burly and bearded ancient warriors we are following, mainly because there are so many of them and most of them are quite invincible. But after a while the maze of characters starts to become clearer, and it's easy to become immersed in this amazing tale."
1354,0,"Each book of about 170 pages is broken up into three or four individual tales, or adventures, mostly following our three heroes - Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei - as they go about their sworn mission, but also breaking away from time to time to tell someone else's tale (usually someone that's doomed to failure or death). Each section begins with an overview of what's to come (i.e. forecasting and spoilers), a map of the vicinity of China that is covered, as well as the odd box tale or illustration of a hero or two. Curiously, the text follows a western convention of family name last, inverting names like Liu Bei as ""Bei Liu"" (Liu is the family name), seemingly pretending that English convention is to do the same with all Chinese names, like Zedong Mao (Mao is the family name), or Kai Shek Chiang (Chiang is the family name, etc). Oh well..."
1355,0,"Now with this, the twelfth volume, we get the aftermath of Red Cliff, when both the winner and the loser of that grand battle realise that they've both been played by the real victor, Liu Bei, who may be technically allied with Sun Quan but is still very much his own man, winning territory and growing stronger under the strategies of Zhuge Liang."
1356,0,"And while there is very little to be seen of Cao Cao in this book, still it opens with him in a showdown with Guan Yu, then gets into his depression as the man who lost an army, then some episodes with his sons - who are really only seen here for the first time, but who probably become more important as the story goes on. Among the victors, more stratagems between the Liu and Sun camps, and evil cackling Doctor Evil-type laughter. Zhang Fei once again provides doofus-like comic relief (not sure I like this very much), there are brief skirmishes with minor warlords in the never-ending war, as Zhuge Liang tricks Zhou Yu one more time; comic relief as Zhou Yu has a spastic attack, a Guan Yu episode with an ageing warrior, and more nutty feudal insanity. Finally, Liu Bei marches bravely into a sure death trap, with only the ingenious plan of Zhuge Liang to save him - and it does! We also get a glimpse of Sun Quan's crazy mom, the Lady Wu. Great grandstanding - can't wait to read the next one!!"

1359,0,"Now with this, the tenth volume, we get just what is said in the title - a great deal of discussion, and hardly any battle after the retreat at the first part of the book and Zhao Yun's splendid mission into enemy territory to try to save Liu Bei's family (there are a few beheadings, though). Zhang Fei freaks out, even Liu Bei freaks out too!! Zhuge Liang enters Sun Zhao's camp and molds the will of his court advisors like clay, although Sun Zhao's sister partially undoes some of his good work. At this point Zhou Yu also becomes an important character in the story, and a keen rival to Zhuge Liang. Guan Yu shows off his bad-assery, when he's ""not much fun to drink with."" When asked to clarify, he adds ""Let's just say that when liquor is flowing around me, blood flow is never far behind!"" COOL!! Zhou Yu's drunken sword flame dance for his old friend Jiang Gan is a pretty nutty episode, and so are Cao Cao's impulsive beheadings of his naval commanders and Zhuge Liang's famous 100,000 arrows episode. Now everything's ready for the battle episode called Red Cliff!"
1360,0,"War of Words, like the books the immediately precede and follow it, forms part of the plot of the John Woo film also called Red Cliff, which does a far more dramatic job of telling the story of Red Cliff, particularly the gambit about Cao Cao's naval commanders, and the 100,000 arrows deceit. Great!"
1361,0,A very dense historical epic that is considered one of most important classic novels of China. From all accounts it’s a challenging book to translate which is probably why most people outside of a Chinese language audience haven’t heard of it. The translators have made a few decisions that you might question but they were clearly done for the benefit of the English speaking audience.
1362,0,"First, there is a huge number of characters introduced in the Chinese original that you are expected to remember pages later. I am not sure how common this is in Chinese literature but I know of no comparable English work where this number of characters are introduced in just the first chapters. In this translation, instead of traditional Chinese names the translators have given the characters unique English names. Easier to remember but still a challenge, in fact, from what I’ve heard even Chinese speakers find this book challenging on this matter. However, there are a number very interesting and colorful characters you get to know in this large crowd and their stories are compelling."
1363,0,"Second, the translators use common English colloquials in place of Chinese idioms that are near impossible to translate into understandable English meanings. Initially it’s a little jarring to encounter these but you get used to them."
1364,0,"Third, the narrative is written in the present tense which is a little odd for a historical novel when you start reading but it’s not noticeable after a few pages."
1365,0,This book may not be for the casual reader but I found the book entertaining and very interesting throughout.
1366,0,they've translated the names. it's very distracting otherwise maybe a good translation but I  just couldn't read very far into it because of that
