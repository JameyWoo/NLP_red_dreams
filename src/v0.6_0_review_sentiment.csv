1,0,0.051388888888888894,"Thought of as the first novel written ""The Tale of Genji"" was written during the Heian period by Lady Murasaki Shikibu.  The story is an interpretation of her accounts in the royal court of Japan.  The setting is placed in the capital of Japan in the 10th century.  Her writings spanned her life in court which changed and matured while she served the Empress Akiko.  Once completed, the tale was widely accepted immediately after its release.  The story recounts the life of a noblemen brought to commoner's status by his father the emperor.  His beauty and talents (poetry, music, seduction) are heavenly and beyond reproach.  It follows his life from childhood to adulthood and how drastic turning points of his life are overcome (the story carries past his death and on through to his descendants).  An example would be his self exile to Suma  after a disastrous affair emboldens his love for Murasaki (the heroine of the story).  He grows as the years pass and learns a great deal from his past indiscretions.  A bond can be felt with the main character.  Even though his situations occurred in times long past, they can still be related to situations of love, close friendships, family bonding and the overcoming of one's place in life."

Written by a noblewoman during the last period of classical Japanese history, and at a time when the imperial court of Japan was at the height of its splendor, ""The Tale of Genji"" may be the first great novel ever written; and it offers all the qualities and pleasures that great novels have delivered in the thousand years since its composition."
5,0,0.1605,"Not much is known about author Murasaki Shikibu, except that she served at court as a lady-in-waiting during the Heian period of Japanese history, and therefore knew well the court life about which she wrote in ""The Tale of Genji."" As translator Royall Tyler of Australian National University explains in an informative foreword, Shikibu was better-educated than most women of her time; she was fluent in written and spoken Chinese, even though women of her time were not supposed to know either. (Chinese was the language of the Japanese court, just as people in the Roman imperial court spoke Greek, and French was long spoken in the royal court of England; then, as now, fluency in a second language -- especially one associated with high culture -- was a mark of a superior education.) Because of her education, Shikibu was exposed to the magnificent heritage of classical Chinese culture and philosophy, all of which, combined with Shikibu’s own gifts for detailed observation of human character, informs ""The Tale of Genji."""

From early childhood, Genji distinguishes himself by his precocious talent and his extraordinarily handsome looks; and therefore the Emperor, feeling that a formal tie to the imperium will actually hold Genji back, declares Genji a commoner – an arrangement that will, in theory, give Genji a chance to advance further on the basis of his own merits."
7,0,0.2847670250896057,"Genji is young, handsome, charming, socially prominent, and rich; and therefore it should be no surprise that young women are attracted to him, and he to them. His romances are many, and modern readers may find Genji to be, in modern parlance, a bit of a player. The Japanese word for “philanderer” is, 女たらし, on’natarashi, and author Shikibu’s attitude toward Genji’s many affairs is interestingly complex. There is often a wish-fulfillment element to fiction, as there is to myth; and it is easy to imagine some readers of ""The Tale of Genji,"" especially male readers, saying, “Well, if I were young, handsome, charming, socially prominent and rich, wouldn’t I…” At the same time, Shikibu unflinchingly presents a world where different rules exist for men and women when it comes to sexual behavior – a world rather like our own – and chronicles with a clear authorial eye the pain that Genji’s affairs cause for women like his first wife Aoi (the two are married when Genji is 12 and Aoi is 16). Moreover, some of Genji's ""seductions"" may seem, to a modern reader, more like rape. Yet Shikibu simply sets down her observations regarding her characters, and lets the reader draw his or her own conclusions."

In the imperial capital at what is now the city of Kyoto, affairs of state are administered by a Minister of the Left and a Minister of the Right; and while those designations have nothing to do with the modern designation of “Left” meaning liberalism and “Right” referring to conservatism, it is no surprise that these two chief ministers may have competing ambitions, and may not always see eye to eye. In Genji’s case, the Minister of the Left is Aoi’s father, and therefore Genji’s father-in-law, and the Minister of the Right is a political rival to Genji. Genji is caught in bed with Oborozukiyo, the daughter of the Minister of the Right, and from that point forward, Oborozukiyo’s older sister, the Kokiden Consort who later becomes Empress Mother, becomes a bitter, implacable, permanent, and ever-more-powerful enemy of Genji."

I know that Genji’s reverses and recoveries in this abridged version, including an extended period of exile from the imperial court, only hint at the larger story covered in the 897 pages that I have not yet read, a larger story that Shikibu ultimately takes beyond the life of Genji himself."

Beyond those travel-related considerations, however, ""The Tale of Genji"" is purely and simply a great novel.

I had hand surgery this summer and have been discovering the joys of one handed reading with my Kindle. I thought this an ideal time to revisit an old favorite. Wrong. This sad, truncated version lacks complexity, depth and charm. It breaks off incomprehensibly before the deaths of Murasaki and Genji, and the whole last third of the novel, the most psychologically interesting part, is missing. There are parts that Tyler usefully omitted, like those concerned with poor dreary Suetsumuhana, but if I had encountered it in this form 50 years ago I would never have given it a second reading. Also I think I do not like the translation as well, but that is a judgement formed without the ability right now to compare this version with the other translations. My advice is go for Seidensticker. The Waley translation is my sentimental favorite but he for some reason left out a chapter."

24,0,0.12805904478035626,"The relative thinness of this book made me question its nature since previous versions I have seen of this tale were a lot thicker. Reading through the description more closely explained the discrepancy, this project only includes summaries, brief excerpts and explanations of what the tale is about rather than reproducing it in its entirety. The Tale of Genji was written by a Japanese noblewoman, Murasaki Shikibu. It combines prose and poetry, and “is widely considered” as “the world’s first novel”, the term novel here refers to this very combination of genres, prose and poetry, as prior works separated these two disciplines, and most earlier prose did not have some of the characteristics that we now recognize in the formula of a novel (a hodgepodge of all sorts of bits that come together to tell a single personal story). This volume is illustrated with paintings and calligraphy from the Genji Album (created by a famous court painter in 1510 in Kyoto) from the Harvard Art Museum’s collection, “the oldest dated set of Genji illustrations known to exist.” The author, Melissa McCormick is a professor of Japanese Art and Culture at Harvard. This is the first time all of these 108 paintings have been reproduced together. Given how long ago they were painted, and their beauty (surely, they would have made for a great pop children’s book) it is strange that nobody has attempted this collection before. These paintings were donated to a temple in 1516 and were not seen again before Harvard acquired it in 1957. The paintings are a bit postmodern in style, as they have some broken lines and strange perspectives. Some of the more standard Japanese art I have seen have much crisper lines and focus only on the main figures, but these images reproduce little flowers in gardens and display wrinkles in some of the characters’ faces. Some of this makes me question if there’s a chance this collection is a set of forgeries. It’s very strange that nobody has made note of it across so many centuries before it surfaced, and that nobody published these until now, and the style kind of reflects mid-twentieth century American art… But, I’m sure they’ve run the tests on these pages to date them properly. The book is elegantly designed, printed and put together. A cloth bookmark with gilded edges to remember a page one is on is particularly elegant; I miss these types of little bookmarks; I think this is the first I’ve seen in a book I’m reviewing in the last 100 books or more. The versions of the poems from the novel in English, transcribed in English in Japanese sounds, and then in the original Japanese (positioned in vertical stacks as in the original) are all very thoughtfully done. The commentary and summaries from the novel should help those who are taking a course on this novel to digest what it is about, and the relevant background. For example, near the end there is a description of a procession where Niou ignores the sisters, “even though they have been told to prepare for the prince’s visit”; this humiliates them. “Oigimi had already been doubtful of Niou’s intentions, but this indignity shames her to the core. She wants nothing more than to disappear, a goal she finally accomplishes by the end of the chapter when she loses all will to live and simply stops eating…” (211). If you want to find out what happens next, I guess you will have to read the novel or pick up a copy of this book. This book will benefit any library’s collection, as lacking these works of art or the first of all novels is a serious deficiency."

Well, every few years the characters get a promotion and a new set of titles, so there is a constant cycling of titles as the book goes on.

Have no doubt: Genji is hard on his lovers.  He changes his mind, he demands too much, he chases one woman only to find one who is better placed and so he chases her instead.  About two thirds of the way through the book Genji dies, and the story passes on to his descendants.  This last part of the book is really interesting, and though I had been afraid I would be bored I was hooked for the last few hundred pages of the story.  The tale simply comes to an abrupt hald, and it is clear than there is either more of the story to be discovered in a dusty attic somewhere, or Lady Murasaki died before completing the book."

31,0,0.20576298701298706,"Many reviewers suggest that the Waley translation has more beautiful language, and that may be.  The general criticism of the Waley translation is that he turns Genji into an Edwardian gentleman.  I did not understand the meaning of that statement until I read this, more accurate translation.  Genji does things which raised eyebrows in his time, would get you thrown in jail today, and which were probably unspeakable in Edwardian times.  As a result, Waley worked his way around these events which results in a somewhat different story from that in the Tyler translation.  Just to take one example, when Genji brings back the young Murasaki whom he intends to bring up as a future wife, Waley never mentions exactly what happens and implies that Genji does not climb into bed with her until she is old enough to be married.  Tyler makes clear that when she arrives to his home, she wants to follow her nurse to bed, but Genji tells her that she will be sleeping with him, although he does have sex with her until she is ""sufficiently"" old to become his wife.  This is but one example of Waley turning Genji into an ""Edwardian gentleman"".  For certain, one realizes much better from reading the Tyler translation of Genji how the traditions of that time set the stage for the Japan of this time, and what amazes me is not how much has changed, but how little."
32,0,0.31190476190476196,"About the tale itself, what more can I say that hasn't been said?  I find this to be a remarkable piece of literature, a carefully crafted and wonderfully told tale of the height of the Heian era, the elegant golden age of Japan where aristocrats correspond in poetry and romances are hatched from a glimpse of a sleeve or the twang of the biwa.  Tied strongly to the context of the times--the norms, values, and sensibilities are uniquely Heian--this tale is in many ways influenced by the Japanese take on Buddhism, specifically the focus on the transience of all things, although the intense focus on aesthetics and worldly beauty seems rather un-Buddhist in many ways.  Yet, the tale is universal as well in its broader themes; that it is still widely read and enjoyed a thousand years after its composition in many cultures outside of Japan is a testament to this fact.  That said, it is not a tale for everyone.  Its length, its distance culturally from the modern Western heritage, its leisurely and sometimes slightly plodding plot--these will put off many.  And yet, for the interested, attentive reader, this book is an immensely enjoyable read and also window into a unique and beautiful time and place in human history."
33,0,0.16363636363636364,"Regarding the translation, ultimately, all translations have their strengths and their weaknesses; all translators must make tradeoffs and decisions pretty much on a word-by-word basis on issues such as whether to maintain the letter of the text or the spirit of the text, when to remain truer to the source language and when to make concessions to the target language.  As such, there is no such thing as a ""best"" translation, as this is ultimately a subjective decision.  For this reason, I frequently agonize over which translation of a work to read, as which translation you read (especially the first time one encounters a work) will forever color your perceptions, emotions, and enjoyment relating to the work."
34,0,0.1521428571428571,"In the case of the Tale of Genji, however, the choice was not agonizing for me.  Even though I count certain translations that take freedoms with the original text as favorites (e.g. FitzGerald's version of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat is a guilty pleasure of mine), Waley's remarkable liberties with the text were a non-starter for me.  This might be a particular bias for me, for as someone who can understand Japanese, I can compare Murasaki's original with Waley's version and see the differences whereas for other languages I cannot understand, I can remain blissfully ignorant of the differences between the translation and the source material.  Seidensticker is much more faithful to the substance of the original than Waley, but in terms of style, whereas Murasaki's writing tends to be rather flowing, elegant, poetic, and indirect, Seidensticker's prose is characterized by relatively short, choppy sentences and characterized by a directness that, while more appropriate for English, is a bit jarring for those who can read the original text.  Although Seidensticker's translation could be seen as less ""cluttered"" by footnotes, without such notes the frequent allusions to other works (be they poetry, historical works, or other fictional accounts) that Murasaki makes--instantly identifiable to Murasaki's contemporaries--are lost on the modern reader.  Seidensticker has his followers, but I personally do not find him enjoyable."
35,0,0.20641025641025637,"In contrast, I found Tyler's translation to both remarkably faithful to the original and yet quite enjoyable in modern English.  First of all, Tyler provides a thorough and interesting introduction to the work, which helps put the reader in the context in which it was written.  Stylistically, Tyler's language matches the leisurely, flowing, and poetic style of Murasaki quite well.  Consider that in the first three paragraphs of the text, the original contains 7 sentences.  Tyler translates this in 6.  Seidensticker uses a remarkable 15 sentences!  Tyler is also much closer to the original in referring to most characters by their titles rather than by name.  Even the person who is most commonly referred to by name, Genji, is called by a rather generic surname that is as much as or more reflective of his status in the nobility (the Minamoto ""clan"") rather than a ""family name"" in the modern sense of the word.  This authenticity places demands on the reader that Seidensticker does not; for some this ""burden"" is more trouble than its worth (and to be honest, can make it difficult to get back into the book after an absence of any length), but personally in addition to this convention's faithfulness to the original I find this touch to create a level of intimacy that draws the reader into the novel, as an insider for whom names are no longer necessary.  Tyler provides the titles and names used at each chapter start (as well as a brief introduction, which is frequently necessary because the chapters do not always flow chronologically) and occasionally provides footnotes where the title usage gets confusing (personally, there were a few places were I could have used more footnotes along those lines, but 98% of the time it is clear to the attentive reader who is being referred to)."
36,0,0.17772988505747128,"Just as in Seidensticker's translation, there are many beautiful illustrations.  Versions of this tale have been illustrated in Japan almost as long as the novel has been around, so this adds not only a nice aesthetic touch in keeping with Heian sensibilities but also faithfulness to the tradition of the tale.  Tyler pays considerable attention to the poetry in the tale, which is ridiculously difficult to translate due to the many layers of word play and allusion to other works of poetry and literature that simply cannot be captured in modern English.  Somewhat regrettably, many of Tyler's clever turns of phrase (such as exploiting the remarkable similarity in dual meaning of the modern English ""pine"" and the Japanese ""matsu"") will likely be lost on many who are not familiar with the Japanese language, but they are enjoyable for those who do understand what Tyler is up to (and can be enjoyed anyway by those who do not).  Almost all poems have footnotes with additional information about the style, substance, and allusions present in the original poem."
37,0,0.27499999999999997,"In the end, Tyler's faithfulness to both the style and substance of Murasaki's original places demands on the reader; not all will enjoy the expectations he places on the reader with respect to such issues as titles versus names.  As always with translations, kick the tires on a couple of options and find what works for you.  However, for me personally, it is this faithfulness to an incredibly gifted writer and a lyrical and poetic tale that makes Tyler the translation of choice for me."
38,0,0.22006172839506172,"The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, in an impressive translation by Royall Tyler, is a classic of world literature. The tale from eleventh century Japan recreates (in over eleven hundred pages) a time and a region long lost, distant from memory and everyday life, and yet full of timeless and contemporary human passions and feelings. Before talking about the tale itself, we must commend the translator for imbibing prose and poetry within text with a clarity and a fluidity rare in translations. The elegant, lucid and engaging English translation provides ample footnotes to guide readers unfamiliar with names, places, idioms, customs, laws, culture and court life of the eleventh century Japan.  While reading a massive novel from another language, written in another century, we always worry about how much is left untranslated or is not communicated at all. Most translations from Indian languages into English give me a massive heartburn. Here the original is far beyond my reach, and I admire the quality of both the text and translation. Maybe I know it is best to gain what I can by reading the translation, than not read it at all. Perhaps the whole process of reading The Tale of Genji for me resembles a typical passionate communication between a suitor and a beloved described over and over again in the book. Two bodies sit separated by many blinds and customs; the conversation is carried on through calligraphed messages and through intermediaries. When one puts his or her heart into it, this conversation, however indirect, provides relief, knowledge, insight, understanding, pleasure and peace, exactly as the the Tale of Genji manages to do for me, possibly for any reader."
39,0,0.27402777777777776,"The Tale of Genji is a magnificent work of art, full of romances and songs, music and poetry, and yin and yang. It is a highly readable saga of princes and commoners who rise in regard and rank through their own actions and through influence of whoever holds them dear. The talks and deeds related to renunciation of the world and Buddhist penances are interspersed with a narrative where characters display a strong attachment to the world stemming from their family ties & cares and beloveds. Genji, called the Shining Prince for his exceptional beauty and charm, is a son of the emperor. His life is the centerpiece of the tale, and the narrative is primarily built around his trials and triumphs in politics, love and religion. The list of romances described in the book runs long, and on every page, appears a phrase or a verse, often a line or a couplet, mostly inspired by some famous poem seemingly known to one and all, written as part of banter between lovers, or as complaint or praise by suitors. Several different string instruments (biwa, kin, etc) and flute are held in great regard, and exceptional musical ability is admired and encourages in princes, women and nobles. Painting, dance, calligraphy, poetry and dress-making are all integral to the tale. There are no wars, no duels, there is almost no blood-shed, and there are no peasants, few commoners, no armies. The Tale of Genji has many memorable, moving and majestic sentences and passages on or about: the vagaries of weather, the charms & effects of changing seasons, festivals full of regal splendor, pilgrimages, impromptu or planned concerts and performances, monks and monasteries, births and deaths, dresses and fragrances, gifts and messages, the meanings and resonances of symbols like cherry blossoms, pine trees, acorn, bridges, rivers, mountains and wisteria leaves, admiration for Chinese tales and dresses, silks, and so on."
40,0,0.04122807017543859,"Some of the most striking things in The Tale of Genji for me are about the role of women in family and society. Women are secluded and hardly meet any men, they are seen only by their lovers (ideally their husbands), while the princes and the nobles grab every chance to go after anyone they get even a faint whiff or glimpse of. Often a prince appears in the bed of a woman without warning, (usually with the help from trusted associates/ helpers/ nurses of the woman) and by returning back on the next two nights, makes the chosen (fortunate or unfortunate) woman his bride. Finding good husbands for daughters is a big concern for fathers, and the progress in rank at court requires strong support of a wife's family. There are a few positions at court available only to women, and multiple wives who surround the powerful princes vie for his attention. Perhaps I note how women lived behind blinds and curtains, away from eyes of any men, including their close relatives, as it is often assumed that such practices exist or existed only in the Near-Eastern, South Asian or in the Middle-Eastern cultures. Also by reading the tale you discover how committed the Japanese men were (maybe still are) to the so-called gallantry. The men go shooting-off love poems to anyone they take a fancy to, including wives of others (including close relations), and when courtship fails, they sometimes end up taking them by force. Given how men behave, the need to seclude and protect the women seems to be justified.  A lot of action in the novel happens at night, behind closed doors, in forbidden chambers, and the author often leaves off a description by saying the details did not reach her, or the details or verses spoken were trite enough to be left out. Such remarks however never break the narrative. Another striking thing in the Tale of Genji is the mention of spirits who take hold of other peoples bodies (minds), afflicting them, and how Buddhists priests drive such spirits out with prayer and chants, after making them to confess their whims. I grew up seeing such things in the Himalayan villages and towns, and a mention of every appellation and rites like that in the book drew my attention."
41,0,0.24960317460317458,"In the world literature written between eighth to fourteenth century AD, a few other exceptional books come to my mind. The Conference of Birds by Attar is a Persian classic, a sufi composition, full of fables and instruction, is very inspirational and to my eyes, it is also sensational in how sexuality is described therein. Geet-Govinda by Jayadeva in Sanskrit is probably the most important text among many that are counted in Radha-Krishan romance, Krishan-bhakti or God-as-a-beloved tradition. Decameron by Boccaccio in Italian has a string of tales, and some are quite risque, and yet many have moral connotations as well. After reading The Tale of Genji, and thinking about all the classic medieval texts I have read, I conclude that though our ancestors were quite given to romance, there was always a stream of spiritual aspirations within them. Perhaps we have become more hypocritical and prudish than our ancestors when it comes to sexuality, and at the same time, we have become more withdrawn from religion and spirituality. The classics mentioned here, along with The Tale of Genji, in respective cultures have influence every writer and poet who came after them, and thus these continue to influence the corpus of human thought, feeling, morality and memory."
42,0,0.3982758620689655,"The Tale of Genji, like War of Peace, Mahabharata, Shahnameh or Odyssey, is endless and immortal. Murasaki paints a masterpiece with a wide canvass that continues the stories through multiple generations, including hundreds of characters, developed quite remarkably within this story, portrayed with beauty and grace. The author named Genji's most beloved Murasaki. Though Genji and Murasaki attract our deepest interest and sympathies, the book is like a garden with many characters, each prone to seasonal changes in favor and form, and though all trees have their own stories of spring blossoms and autumn leaves, and  snow or rain drops or dew, the narrative binds them together quite nicely. Murasaki seemed to have written the tale with a lot of empathy for human condition. To love who must not be loved, to carry guilt of yielding to a forbidden desire, to raise another's child as your own, to love a lookalike sister or a cousin in lieu of the lost or dead beloved, to leave safety of palace and guards and go out on escapades that can destroy reputations, to steal your best friend's love interest, to become a monk and yet keep worrying about renounced relations, or to haunt your beloved after your death: there are many dark shades to the characters and their thoughts and actions in this tale. The characters often talk of cherry & plum blossoms, of fleeting life, of nature of beauty and romance, of poetry and skill, of music, and wile reading The Tale of Genji, the reader begins to respond to the thoughts and words of the ancient world. Reading The Tale of Genji then becomes an experience rich in mixed emotions, of tenderness, joy, sympathy, melancholy, sorrow, nostalgia and enchantment. Wonderful and overwhelming tale, highly recommended!"

Most people who read this book are doing so because they have to for academic purposes, like a class or something. If you have to choose between this translation and others, such as the Arthur Waley translation, I highly recommend this version, simply because it reads as modern English, with modern grammatical structure and modern common sentence structure. Arthur Waley's translation is modern, but his choice in wording and sentence structure makes it easy to see the book as a sort of cloud of words, to get lost and confused in, rather than a story with a narrative and structure."

47,0,0.16770833333333332,"This is a replacement review for a far harsher one I initially wrote. I’ve come over time to realize I was being unfair to Tyler, trivializing his accomplishments and maximizing my objections. It has to be said that Tyler seems scrupulously faithful to Mursaki Shikibu. In the years since this version was produced, I haven’t found one reviewer or obsessive reader catching him in any mistakes. The book has an effective leisurely pace appropriate to its genre (monogatari), and it strives for an aristocratic subtle tone which is unquestionable one of the hallmarks of the work in the original language."
48,0,0.018376984126984137,"However, I still feel the work is flawed on a stylistic level. The level of footnotes is cumbersome and this  coupled with the use of sobriquets rather than personal names—the latter faithful to the original—makes the work very confusing for a first-time reader. Reminding the reader in a list of characters or a footnote at the bottom of a page that a honorific at any given time refers to, say, To no Chujo doesn’t help much if the reader isn’t already deeply familiar enough with the work to know who the character conventionally referred to as To no Chujo is. There is a reason that, from very early on, these pseudo-names were solidified and bestowed on the characters. The work is too dense, too involved to keep up with who is who on the basis of suggestion-through-title and honorific. And some of Tyler’s English equivlents for titles or honorifics are doozies (“The Rokojo Haven” is particularly bad). Nomenclature aside, I just find Tyler’s sentence structure dull. I realize he’s trying to find an English equivalent for Murasaki’s languorous style, but there’s a monotony here that is hard to shake off. An argument might be made, “This is the nature of the work’s essential style, you’re responding to the Genji, not Tyler.” The trouble with this argument is that Heian Japanese is simply too far removed from contemporary Japanese or English for a reader to determine if the work __as it would have been read by a contemporary of Murasaki__ is dull or not. The reception of the work suggests, strongly, that it was not dull but incredibly exciting. And a contemporary translation should strive to provide the experience the original reader would have experienced."
49,0,0.09291666666666666,"Somewhat related to this is Tyler’s poor word choice. There are so many examples to choose from. A particularly grating one for me is the chapter title ""The Bluebell."" Technically, the asagao, the flower from which this chapter gains its name, is a morning glory, though in all probability in Heian times the word referred to a bluebell-like plant called in modern Japanese called the kikyo. The trouble with utilizing ""bluebell"" instead of ""morning glory"" is, first of all, a kikyo is not technically a bluebell, only a bluebell-like flower, and secondly, an American cannot but help of either thinking of the flowers that dot the Texas countryside or a particular brand of ice crème, neither of which helps to recreate the atmosphere of Heian Japan. In this same chapter, a character makes the comment, ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" Again, while a similar phrase might exist in the original, choosing the same wording as a popular American adage really hurts the translation."
50,0,0.0478125,"At the end of the day, I still feel Edward Seidensticker’s translation is superior, especially for a first time reader. Characters have their traditional names. Footnotes are kept to a minimum. I should make it clear that this is not because I encountered Seidensticker first. I started with Tyler, and the experience was unpleasant/confusing enough that I switched to Seidensticker. Seidensticker is often referred to as “choppy,” which I think is an inaccurate description. His sentences do not lack anything or veer too awkwardly from one thought to another to count as choppy. , Even more perverse is the description of his prose as “Hemingwayesque.” There is very little in common between Hemingway’s avoidance of adjectives and adverbs in an effort to make simple declarative statements that only record the surface and not the subtext of a situation. The truth is, Seidensticker’s language is the equivalent of an Heian structure—deceptively simple in construction, but sturdy and capable of the most fluid rearrangement to accommodate any individual purpose."

Curious to know more about the Heian period and culture, I acquired Ivan Morris's tremendously helpful and readable ""The World of the Shining Prince."" Then I discovered Edward Seidensticker's superb rendering of ""The Tale of Genji,"" and have read and re-read that version with deepening understanding and enjoyment. Seidensticker, while presumably adhering closer to the language of the original (which even modern Japanese find difficult to read), gave us a translation which is perfumed by the sensuous beauty of what must have been a truly refined and special time and place (albeit a very limited one)."

Tyler's effort seems even closer to the original language, and thereby lies the problem."
58,0,0.015277777777777779,"This version unnecessarily burdens the reader with ever-changing nomenclature. Since in the original characters are known by their rank-names, and Tyler (mostly) adheres to this usage, the reader is  challenged to keep up with the changes. Put the book down for a day or two and you will feel quite lost for several minutes when you restart. As an aide, the translator does provide footnotes to clue you in, but this just makes things more awkward and tedious. For example, at the start of Chapter 43, ""Red Plum Blossom"" in Tyler's version: ""There was in those days a gentleman known as the Inspector Grand Counselor, the late Chancellor's second son, hence the younger brother of the Intendant of the Watch (1)"" This same sentence in Seidensticker reads: ""Kobai, the oldest surviving son of the late To no Chujo, was now Lord Inspector."" How much more to the point!"
59,0,0.4791666666666667,"To conclude, while Tyler's translation is awesome in its scholarship and abundant detail (including sources of the poetry), it is also much less readable. To my mind, the scholarship gets in the way of the story telling. I found myself longing for my Seidensticker at many turns as I went dutifully through the Tyler. Aside from providing a more continuous flow to the story, I also found that Seidensticker's translation of the many poems in the tale more comprehensible and lyrical."

It's about a troubled prince who is searching for the love of a mother by trying to love women both sexually and romantically. He ends up falling in love with his thirty something year old step mother who was his mother's cousin or sister (I can't remember) when he's like fifteen to fill the void of not having a mother. But a lot of things happen pertaining to complicated character webs and it's written in a beautiful, poetic way that CAN and will leave the reader confused. Especially involving the syntax of the novel. A lot of the love scenes, I've noticed, just stop and bounce to a completely different subject and I speculate it's because the author Shikibu didn't want to seem too entirely improper for her time. But that's just a guess. This is some heavy reading that I would recommend for people 18+, not for the reasons of ""sexual"" content but because of all the underlying meanings and little archetypes that could easily be missed by a less experienced reader and thus lose all purpose of plot. So as long as a you're a well-read individual, then go ahead and go crazy. It's a wonderful, inter-generational book that should be on every literature-lover's shelf."

I cannot read 10th century Japanese, but reading the comments by readers of this novel on Amazon, all three translations have problems.  Some of the comments are by readers of all three translations.  All three translations have been picked by different readers as the best.  First, I will start with a few thoughts about the book.  It is considered to be the first novel ever written(a little before 1000 A.D.) and, by most, the greatest work of Japanese literature.  It is a joy to read and if you like reading the 'Classics' you will greatly enjoy reading this book.

The only complaint I have of this book is the tassel that it comes with of cotton and is not bound at the bottom, as a consequence it has started to unravel. I'll probably end up cutting it off since it will completely unravel before you've finished the book. Other than this, great read and good quality."

Have no doubt: Genji is hard on his lovers.  He changes his mind, he demands too much, he chases one woman only to find one who is better placed and so he chases her instead.  About two thirds of the way through the book Genji dies, and the story passes on to his descendants.  This last part of the book is really interesting, and though I had been afraid I would be bored I was hooked for the last few hundred pages of the story.

The general criticism of the Waley translation is that he turns Genji into an Edwardian gentleman.  I did not understand the meaning of that statement until I read this, more accurate translation.  Genji does things which raised eyebrows in his time, would get you thrown in jail today, and which were probably unspeakable in Edwardian times.  As a result, Waley worked his way around these events which results in a somewhat different story from that in the Tyler translation.  Just to take one example, when Genji brings back the young Murasaki whom he intends to bring up as a future wife, Waley never mentions exactly what happens and implies that Genji does not climb into bed with her until she is old enough to be married.  Tyler makes clear that when she arrives to his home, she wants to follow her nurse to bed, but Genji tells her that she will be sleeping with him, although he does have sex with her until she is ""sufficiently"" old to become his wife.  This is but one example of Waley turning Genji into an ""Edwardian gentleman"".  For certain, one realizes much better from reading the Tyler translation of Genji how the traditions of that time set the stage for the Japan of this time, and what amazes me is not how much has changed, but how little."

I find this to be a remarkable piece of literature, a carefully crafted and wonderfully told tale of the height of the Heian era, the elegant golden age of Japan where aristocrats correspond in poetry and romances are hatched from a glimpse of a sleeve or the twang of the biwa.  Tied strongly to the context of the times--the norms, values, and sensibilities are uniquely Heian--this tale is in many ways influenced by the Japanese take on Buddhism, specifically the focus on the transience of all things, although the intense focus on aesthetics and worldly beauty seems rather un-Buddhist in many ways.  Yet, the tale is universal as well in its broader themes; that it is still widely read and enjoyed a thousand years after its composition in many cultures outside of Japan is a testament to this fact.  That said, it is not a tale for everyone.  Its length, its distance culturally from the modern Western heritage, its leisurely and sometimes slightly plodding plot--these will put off many.  And yet, for the interested, attentive reader, this book is an immensely enjoyable read and also window into a unique and beautiful time and place in human history."
96,0,0.16363636363636364,"Regarding the translation, ultimately, all translations have their strengths and their weaknesses; all translators must make tradeoffs and decisions pretty much on a word-by-word basis on issues such as whether to maintain the letter of the text or the spirit of the text, when to remain truer to the source language and when to make concessions to the target language.  As such, there is no such thing as a ""best"" translation, as this is ultimately a subjective decision.  For this reason, I frequently agonize over which translation of a work to read, as which translation you read (especially the first time one encounters a work) will forever color your perceptions, emotions, and enjoyment relating to the work."
97,0,0.1521428571428571,"In the case of the Tale of Genji, however, the choice was not agonizing for me.  Even though I count certain translations that take freedoms with the original text as favorites (e.g. FitzGerald's version of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat is a guilty pleasure of mine), Waley's remarkable liberties with the text were a non-starter for me.  This might be a particular bias for me, for as someone who can understand Japanese, I can compare Murasaki's original with Waley's version and see the differences whereas for other languages I cannot understand, I can remain blissfully ignorant of the differences between the translation and the source material.  Seidensticker is much more faithful to the substance of the original than Waley, but in terms of style, whereas Murasaki's writing tends to be rather flowing, elegant, poetic, and indirect, Seidensticker's prose is characterized by relatively short, choppy sentences and characterized by a directness that, while more appropriate for English, is a bit jarring for those who can read the original text.  Although Seidensticker's translation could be seen as less ""cluttered"" by footnotes, without such notes the frequent allusions to other works (be they poetry, historical works, or other fictional accounts) that Murasaki makes--instantly identifiable to Murasaki's contemporaries--are lost on the modern reader.  Seidensticker has his followers, but I personally do not find him enjoyable."
98,0,0.20641025641025637,"In contrast, I found Tyler's translation to both remarkably faithful to the original and yet quite enjoyable in modern English.  First of all, Tyler provides a thorough and interesting introduction to the work, which helps put the reader in the context in which it was written.  Stylistically, Tyler's language matches the leisurely, flowing, and poetic style of Murasaki quite well.  Consider that in the first three paragraphs of the text, the original contains 7 sentences.  Tyler translates this in 6.  Seidensticker uses a remarkable 15 sentences!  Tyler is also much closer to the original in referring to most characters by their titles rather than by name.  Even the person who is most commonly referred to by name, Genji, is called by a rather generic surname that is as much as or more reflective of his status in the nobility (the Minamoto ""clan"") rather than a ""family name"" in the modern sense of the word.  This authenticity places demands on the reader that Seidensticker does not; for some this ""burden"" is more trouble than its worth (and to be honest, can make it difficult to get back into the book after an absence of any length), but personally in addition to this convention's faithfulness to the original I find this touch to create a level of intimacy that draws the reader into the novel, as an insider for whom names are no longer necessary.  Tyler provides the titles and names used at each chapter start (as well as a brief introduction, which is frequently necessary because the chapters do not always flow chronologically) and occasionally provides footnotes where the title usage gets confusing (personally, there were a few places were I could have used more footnotes along those lines, but 98% of the time it is clear to the attentive reader who is being referred to)."
99,0,0.17772988505747128,"Just as in Seidensticker's translation, there are many beautiful illustrations.  Versions of this tale have been illustrated in Japan almost as long as the novel has been around, so this adds not only a nice aesthetic touch in keeping with Heian sensibilities but also faithfulness to the tradition of the tale.  Tyler pays considerable attention to the poetry in the tale, which is ridiculously difficult to translate due to the many layers of word play and allusion to other works of poetry and literature that simply cannot be captured in modern English.  Somewhat regrettably, many of Tyler's clever turns of phrase (such as exploiting the remarkable similarity in dual meaning of the modern English ""pine"" and the Japanese ""matsu"") will likely be lost on many who are not familiar with the Japanese language, but they are enjoyable for those who do understand what Tyler is up to (and can be enjoyed anyway by those who do not).  Almost all poems have footnotes with additional information about the style, substance, and allusions present in the original poem."
100,0,0.27499999999999997,"In the end, Tyler's faithfulness to both the style and substance of Murasaki's original places demands on the reader; not all will enjoy the expectations he places on the reader with respect to such issues as titles versus names.  As always with translations, kick the tires on a couple of options and find what works for you.  However, for me personally, it is this faithfulness to an incredibly gifted writer and a lyrical and poetic tale that makes Tyler the translation of choice for me."
101,0,0.22006172839506172,"The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, in an impressive translation by Royall Tyler, is a classic of world literature. The tale from eleventh century Japan recreates (in over eleven hundred pages) a time and a region long lost, distant from memory and everyday life, and yet full of timeless and contemporary human passions and feelings. Before talking about the tale itself, we must commend the translator for imbibing prose and poetry within text with a clarity and a fluidity rare in translations. The elegant, lucid and engaging English translation provides ample footnotes to guide readers unfamiliar with names, places, idioms, customs, laws, culture and court life of the eleventh century Japan.  While reading a massive novel from another language, written in another century, we always worry about how much is left untranslated or is not communicated at all. Most translations from Indian languages into English give me a massive heartburn. Here the original is far beyond my reach, and I admire the quality of both the text and translation. Maybe I know it is best to gain what I can by reading the translation, than not read it at all. Perhaps the whole process of reading The Tale of Genji for me resembles a typical passionate communication between a suitor and a beloved described over and over again in the book. Two bodies sit separated by many blinds and customs; the conversation is carried on through calligraphed messages and through intermediaries. When one puts his or her heart into it, this conversation, however indirect, provides relief, knowledge, insight, understanding, pleasure and peace, exactly as the the Tale of Genji manages to do for me, possibly for any reader."
102,0,0.27402777777777776,"The Tale of Genji is a magnificent work of art, full of romances and songs, music and poetry, and yin and yang. It is a highly readable saga of princes and commoners who rise in regard and rank through their own actions and through influence of whoever holds them dear. The talks and deeds related to renunciation of the world and Buddhist penances are interspersed with a narrative where characters display a strong attachment to the world stemming from their family ties & cares and beloveds. Genji, called the Shining Prince for his exceptional beauty and charm, is a son of the emperor. His life is the centerpiece of the tale, and the narrative is primarily built around his trials and triumphs in politics, love and religion. The list of romances described in the book runs long, and on every page, appears a phrase or a verse, often a line or a couplet, mostly inspired by some famous poem seemingly known to one and all, written as part of banter between lovers, or as complaint or praise by suitors. Several different string instruments (biwa, kin, etc) and flute are held in great regard, and exceptional musical ability is admired and encourages in princes, women and nobles. Painting, dance, calligraphy, poetry and dress-making are all integral to the tale. There are no wars, no duels, there is almost no blood-shed, and there are no peasants, few commoners, no armies. The Tale of Genji has many memorable, moving and majestic sentences and passages on or about: the vagaries of weather, the charms & effects of changing seasons, festivals full of regal splendor, pilgrimages, impromptu or planned concerts and performances, monks and monasteries, births and deaths, dresses and fragrances, gifts and messages, the meanings and resonances of symbols like cherry blossoms, pine trees, acorn, bridges, rivers, mountains and wisteria leaves, admiration for Chinese tales and dresses, silks, and so on."
103,0,0.04122807017543859,"Some of the most striking things in The Tale of Genji for me are about the role of women in family and society. Women are secluded and hardly meet any men, they are seen only by their lovers (ideally their husbands), while the princes and the nobles grab every chance to go after anyone they get even a faint whiff or glimpse of. Often a prince appears in the bed of a woman without warning, (usually with the help from trusted associates/ helpers/ nurses of the woman) and by returning back on the next two nights, makes the chosen (fortunate or unfortunate) woman his bride. Finding good husbands for daughters is a big concern for fathers, and the progress in rank at court requires strong support of a wife's family. There are a few positions at court available only to women, and multiple wives who surround the powerful princes vie for his attention. Perhaps I note how women lived behind blinds and curtains, away from eyes of any men, including their close relatives, as it is often assumed that such practices exist or existed only in the Near-Eastern, South Asian or in the Middle-Eastern cultures. Also by reading the tale you discover how committed the Japanese men were (maybe still are) to the so-called gallantry. The men go shooting-off love poems to anyone they take a fancy to, including wives of others (including close relations), and when courtship fails, they sometimes end up taking them by force. Given how men behave, the need to seclude and protect the women seems to be justified.  A lot of action in the novel happens at night, behind closed doors, in forbidden chambers, and the author often leaves off a description by saying the details did not reach her, or the details or verses spoken were trite enough to be left out. Such remarks however never break the narrative. Another striking thing in the Tale of Genji is the mention of spirits who take hold of other peoples bodies (minds), afflicting them, and how Buddhists priests drive such spirits out with prayer and chants, after making them to confess their whims. I grew up seeing such things in the Himalayan villages and towns, and a mention of every appellation and rites like that in the book drew my attention."
104,0,0.24960317460317458,"In the world literature written between eighth to fourteenth century AD, a few other exceptional books come to my mind. The Conference of Birds by Attar is a Persian classic, a sufi composition, full of fables and instruction, is very inspirational and to my eyes, it is also sensational in how sexuality is described therein. Geet-Govinda by Jayadeva in Sanskrit is probably the most important text among many that are counted in Radha-Krishan romance, Krishan-bhakti or God-as-a-beloved tradition. Decameron by Boccaccio in Italian has a string of tales, and some are quite risque, and yet many have moral connotations as well. After reading The Tale of Genji, and thinking about all the classic medieval texts I have read, I conclude that though our ancestors were quite given to romance, there was always a stream of spiritual aspirations within them. Perhaps we have become more hypocritical and prudish than our ancestors when it comes to sexuality, and at the same time, we have become more withdrawn from religion and spirituality. The classics mentioned here, along with The Tale of Genji, in respective cultures have influence every writer and poet who came after them, and thus these continue to influence the corpus of human thought, feeling, morality and memory."
105,0,0.3982758620689655,"The Tale of Genji, like War of Peace, Mahabharata, Shahnameh or Odyssey, is endless and immortal. Murasaki paints a masterpiece with a wide canvass that continues the stories through multiple generations, including hundreds of characters, developed quite remarkably within this story, portrayed with beauty and grace. The author named Genji's most beloved Murasaki. Though Genji and Murasaki attract our deepest interest and sympathies, the book is like a garden with many characters, each prone to seasonal changes in favor and form, and though all trees have their own stories of spring blossoms and autumn leaves, and  snow or rain drops or dew, the narrative binds them together quite nicely. Murasaki seemed to have written the tale with a lot of empathy for human condition. To love who must not be loved, to carry guilt of yielding to a forbidden desire, to raise another's child as your own, to love a lookalike sister or a cousin in lieu of the lost or dead beloved, to leave safety of palace and guards and go out on escapades that can destroy reputations, to steal your best friend's love interest, to become a monk and yet keep worrying about renounced relations, or to haunt your beloved after your death: there are many dark shades to the characters and their thoughts and actions in this tale. The characters often talk of cherry & plum blossoms, of fleeting life, of nature of beauty and romance, of poetry and skill, of music, and wile reading The Tale of Genji, the reader begins to respond to the thoughts and words of the ancient world. Reading The Tale of Genji then becomes an experience rich in mixed emotions, of tenderness, joy, sympathy, melancholy, sorrow, nostalgia and enchantment. Wonderful and overwhelming tale, highly recommended!"
106,0,0.10666666666666666,"The annotations are quite helpful. The translation reads well. Grammatical errors are rare. Most people who read this book are doing so because they have to for academic purposes, like a class or something. If you have to choose between this translation and others, such as the Arthur Waley translation, I highly recommend this version, simply because it reads as modern English, with modern grammatical structure and modern common sentence structure. Arthur Waley's translation is modern, but his choice in wording and sentence structure makes it easy to see the book as a sort of cloud of words, to get lost and confused in, rather than a story with a narrative and structure."

110,0,0.16770833333333332,"This is a replacement review for a far harsher one I initially wrote. I’ve come over time to realize I was being unfair to Tyler, trivializing his accomplishments and maximizing my objections. It has to be said that Tyler seems scrupulously faithful to Mursaki Shikibu. In the years since this version was produced, I haven’t found one reviewer or obsessive reader catching him in any mistakes. The book has an effective leisurely pace appropriate to its genre (monogatari), and it strives for an aristocratic subtle tone which is unquestionable one of the hallmarks of the work in the original language."
111,0,0.018376984126984137,"However, I still feel the work is flawed on a stylistic level. The level of footnotes is cumbersome and this  coupled with the use of sobriquets rather than personal names—the latter faithful to the original—makes the work very confusing for a first-time reader. Reminding the reader in a list of characters or a footnote at the bottom of a page that a honorific at any given time refers to, say, To no Chujo doesn’t help much if the reader isn’t already deeply familiar enough with the work to know who the character conventionally referred to as To no Chujo is. There is a reason that, from very early on, these pseudo-names were solidified and bestowed on the characters. The work is too dense, too involved to keep up with who is who on the basis of suggestion-through-title and honorific. And some of Tyler’s English equivlents for titles or honorifics are doozies (“The Rokojo Haven” is particularly bad). Nomenclature aside, I just find Tyler’s sentence structure dull. I realize he’s trying to find an English equivalent for Murasaki’s languorous style, but there’s a monotony here that is hard to shake off. An argument might be made, “This is the nature of the work’s essential style, you’re responding to the Genji, not Tyler.” The trouble with this argument is that Heian Japanese is simply too far removed from contemporary Japanese or English for a reader to determine if the work __as it would have been read by a contemporary of Murasaki__ is dull or not. The reception of the work suggests, strongly, that it was not dull but incredibly exciting. And a contemporary translation should strive to provide the experience the original reader would have experienced."
112,0,0.09291666666666666,"Somewhat related to this is Tyler’s poor word choice. There are so many examples to choose from. A particularly grating one for me is the chapter title ""The Bluebell."" Technically, the asagao, the flower from which this chapter gains its name, is a morning glory, though in all probability in Heian times the word referred to a bluebell-like plant called in modern Japanese called the kikyo. The trouble with utilizing ""bluebell"" instead of ""morning glory"" is, first of all, a kikyo is not technically a bluebell, only a bluebell-like flower, and secondly, an American cannot but help of either thinking of the flowers that dot the Texas countryside or a particular brand of ice crème, neither of which helps to recreate the atmosphere of Heian Japan. In this same chapter, a character makes the comment, ""Familiarity breeds contempt."" Again, while a similar phrase might exist in the original, choosing the same wording as a popular American adage really hurts the translation."
113,0,0.0478125,"At the end of the day, I still feel Edward Seidensticker’s translation is superior, especially for a first time reader. Characters have their traditional names. Footnotes are kept to a minimum. I should make it clear that this is not because I encountered Seidensticker first. I started with Tyler, and the experience was unpleasant/confusing enough that I switched to Seidensticker. Seidensticker is often referred to as “choppy,” which I think is an inaccurate description. His sentences do not lack anything or veer too awkwardly from one thought to another to count as choppy. , Even more perverse is the description of his prose as “Hemingwayesque.” There is very little in common between Hemingway’s avoidance of adjectives and adverbs in an effort to make simple declarative statements that only record the surface and not the subtext of a situation. The truth is, Seidensticker’s language is the equivalent of an Heian structure—deceptively simple in construction, but sturdy and capable of the most fluid rearrangement to accommodate any individual purpose."

It's a very pretty book and until I finish, I cannot say much to the story but I get this feeling the Genji Gloves (armor set) from all of my RPGs will finally make more sense. ;)"

I can't imagine that it would have been possible, or at least as rewarding, without all the guides and footnotes and chapter headings and glossaries and maps, etc."

119,0,0.29095238095238096,"A longtime admirer of Murasaki Shikibu's exceptional work, I fell in love with Genji first through Arthur Waley's translation, which made this admittedly exotic novel accessible to non-Japanese readers. Curious to know more about the Heian period and culture, I acquired Ivan Morris's tremendously helpful and readable ""The World of the Shining Prince."" Then I discovered Edward Seidensticker's superb rendering of ""The Tale of Genji,"" and have read and re-read that version with deepening understanding and enjoyment. Seidensticker, while presumably adhering closer to the language of the original (which even modern Japanese find difficult to read), gave us a translation which is perfumed by the sensuous beauty of what must have been a truly refined and special time and place (albeit a very limited one)."

There are also generous appendices including a chronology of events in the novel and a glossary. Line drawings throughout the two volumes (also present in Seidensticker) provide helpful visual clues as to dress and architecture. Tyler's effort seems even closer to the original language, and thereby lies the problem."
121,0,0.015277777777777779,"This version unnecessarily burdens the reader with ever-changing nomenclature. Since in the original characters are known by their rank-names, and Tyler (mostly) adheres to this usage, the reader is  challenged to keep up with the changes. Put the book down for a day or two and you will feel quite lost for several minutes when you restart. As an aide, the translator does provide footnotes to clue you in, but this just makes things more awkward and tedious. For example, at the start of Chapter 43, ""Red Plum Blossom"" in Tyler's version: ""There was in those days a gentleman known as the Inspector Grand Counselor, the late Chancellor's second son, hence the younger brother of the Intendant of the Watch (1)"" This same sentence in Seidensticker reads: ""Kobai, the oldest surviving son of the late To no Chujo, was now Lord Inspector."" How much more to the point!"
122,0,0.4791666666666667,"To conclude, while Tyler's translation is awesome in its scholarship and abundant detail (including sources of the poetry), it is also much less readable. To my mind, the scholarship gets in the way of the story telling. I found myself longing for my Seidensticker at many turns as I went dutifully through the Tyler. Aside from providing a more continuous flow to the story, I also found that Seidensticker's translation of the many poems in the tale more comprehensible and lyrical."

It's about a troubled prince who is searching for the love of a mother by trying to love women both sexually and romantically. He ends up falling in love with his thirty something year old step mother who was his mother's cousin or sister (I can't remember) when he's like fifteen to fill the void of not having a mother. But a lot of things happen pertaining to complicated character webs and it's written in a beautiful, poetic way that CAN and will leave the reader confused. Especially involving the syntax of the novel. A lot of the love scenes, I've noticed, just stop and bounce to a completely different subject and I speculate it's because the author Shikibu didn't want to seem too entirely improper for her time. But that's just a guess. This is some heavy reading that I would recommend for people 18+, not for the reasons of ""sexual"" content but because of all the underlying meanings and little archetypes that could easily be missed by a less experienced reader and thus lose all purpose of plot.

It is considered to be the first novel ever written(a little before 1000 A.D.) and, by most, the greatest work of Japanese literature.

I must recommend the Waley translation to the English-speaking world for being the friendliest read. If you want to read Genji purely for your own enjoyment, as the women of Lady Murasaki's era undoubtedly did, please consider the Waley translation. There is often a complaint that Waley's translation is inaccurate at times and omits passages. But it is not so inaccurate as to give you the wrong impression of the book, and not so frequent in omissions as to be called an abridgment. Furthermore, its charming Edwardian prose makes for an English story that is just as compelling as the Japanese original. Here's an example from chapter 29, when Genji meets with an elderly woman:"
178,0,0.2857142857142857,"Waley: ""She was evidently much enfeebled; but she was perfectly well able to carry on a conversation. 'I always know how things are going here by watching Yugiri,' Genji said to her. 'Lately he has been very absent-minded and depressed, and sometimes I have heard him sighing heavily when he was by himself. I knew this meant he was worrying about you, and I felt I must come and enquire on my own account.'"""

181,0,0.03854166666666666,"Both Seidensticker and Tyler have preserved the opaque language of courtly life, which requires a reread or two to figure out what is being said beneath all the formalities. Tyler has additionally preserved the long, complex sentences of Heian Japanese, and the failure to identify the speaker found in many passages of the original. Where Waley foregoes strict accuracy, it is to make the meaning of the passage clear and uncover the human emotion that pervades Genji's interview."

Once that is out of the way, the tale properly begins in the second chapter with the hero Genji, his rival To no Chujo, and two other young men telling war stories about their conquests. But because this is the middle of the Heian period and there is nobody to fight, the game is courtship and winning means getting behind the screen. To no Chujo knew a woman of exceptional beauty and taste named Yugao. He had a child with her but now both Yugao and the child are gone. Genji is entranced by what he hears and must have her. Such begins the cycle of discovery, courtship, possession, and loss that will be played out over three generations."
184,0,-0.004166666666666663,"  As with most Japanese literature, and Kawabata comes easily to mind, the plot is not nearly as important as the descriptions of setting and a heightened sensitivity for the beauty and sadness of things (mono no aware). Genji is the hero of the story (Kaoru, of the later part) not because of his exploits with women or his machinations at court, but because he is sensitive and articulate enough to communicate what usually cannot be put into words: that life is a sad business of ""unendurable beauty."""
185,0,0.12499999999999999,"  One would expect that after a thousand years, the novel would have lost much its relevance, but this is not the case. In fact, the surprising thing about The Tale of Genji is that it contains the core of what, for want of a better term, may be called the Japanese sensibility. This is not to be confused with the often-maligned notion of Japanese uniqueness. That is a political thing. The Japanese sensibility as manifested in The Tale of Genji is a habit of being coupled with an aesthetic sense."
186,0,0.10178571428571428,"  During Heian Kyo (794-1186), value was placed on a classical knowledge of Chinese poetry, the ability to play a musical instrument, handwriting that showed one's breeding and character, sensitivity to nature and the seasons, a sense of beauty, sportsmanship, duty, and charm. It was a time when matters of state where largely aesthetic questions about what color to wear or the proper classical allusion to fit the hour. In the chapter called ""The Picture Competition"" Murasaki writes, ""It was indeed a moment in the history of our country when the whole energy of the nation seemed to be concentrated upon the search for the prettiest method of mounting paper-scrolls."" These were the things that mattered."
187,0,0.10091575091575092,"  The extraordinary thing about The Tale of Genji is that what was once a chronicle of the lives of a few hundred select people living a thousand years ago has become the mythos for a nation of 128 million. It is almost as if the mannerisms of Heian court life have been replicated in every subsequent milieu. The hierarchy is still with us, as are the mannerly appeals, the focus on the seasons and the passing of time, the emphasis on duty, beauty, ritual, and charm. It is only that the values in the novel have been transposed into a hundred walks of life with seemingly no relation to the Heian period. But dig a little deeper, and they are there. They have just changed form. What Murasaki was able to capture and distill in The Tale of Genji was the fountainhead of a distinctly Japanese civilization (ochobunka). There have been other influences, to be sure, but no other single work of literature can possibly lay claim to being Japan's ""textbook in culture."" Once you have read Genji, you will see its influence everywhere."
188,0,0.205,"  The complete English translations weigh in at around 1100 pages each. Of these, the three principal ones (with their dates of publication) are those by Arthur Waley (1925-1933), Edward G. Seidensticker (1976), and Royall Tyler (2001). Although each has its own strong points, Waley's translation is especially noteworthy because it was the groundbreaking one. Before Waley published the first part in 1925, Genji was largely unknown in the West. After Waley's translation, all those people who had thought that the novel as a literary form had begun with Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740) or even Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1470) had to reset their timelines. Here was something of exceptional beauty written hundreds of years before the English novel had even been thought of."
189,0,0.2835714285714286,"  Waley's translation itself is a work of art. Critics have said that it was in fact too much art and not enough translation - that Waley had overstepped his bounds as a translator. But others, including Tanizaki Junichiro and Ivan Morris, have defended Waley. Morris writes: ""Arthur Waley's version of The Tale of Genji represents the freest possible type of translation. Indeed the word `re-creation' would be more appropriate; for he has brought Murasaki's novel to life as a great work of English literature in its own right."" This accounts for the strange feeling that you have while reading Genji that the novel is recalling works by Jane Austen, George Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy instead of prefiguring them."
190,0,0.15,"  Subsequent translators have sought to rectify some of the shortcomings of Waley's translation. Seidensticker (1976), for example, restored the forms of address commonly used at the time (the use of court titles rather than given names or surnames) and rendered the poetry in couplets set off from the text rather than as quotations within the narrative. Tyler (2001) went even further in following the original Japanese, choosing to offer the reader a great deal of supplementary material to flesh out a more literal translation. This supplementary material includes footnotes, illustrations, maps, a chronology, a glossary, as well as appendices on ""Clothing and Color,"" ""Offices and Titles,"" ""Poetic Allusions,"" ""Characters,"" and ""Further Reading."""
191,0,0.3277777777777778,"  Which should you read? I'd start with Waley's The Tale of Genji because this is a classic and reading Waley is a ""two-for-one"" proposition. Murasaki is here in all her brilliance but so is the guy who used to sit on the steps of the British Museum in between incredible flights of scholarship and imagination. After that, read Ivan Morris's The World of the Shining Prince. This will give you a good understanding of the Heian period. Then Seidensticker and Tyler. Finally, there is William J. Puette's very helpful The Tale of Genji: A Reader's Guide (Tuttle, 1983)."

Denis Washburn's Introduction in the Waley translation was mainly a long synopsis of the story. The Waley translation is the only one of the three without illustrations.

These people did not work but received their large incomes from the ownership of rice fields. A man could have unlimited wives plus concubines, brief affairs etc. There is no explicit sex in the novel. Their society had innumerable rules about dress, behavior, decor etc. They had many gods and apparently never argued about religion. Although the women were subordinate, as in most ancient societies, they were given complete educations and were expected to know as much as a man, except that only men also learned Chinese.

He ends up falling in love with his thirty something year old step mother who was his mother's cousin or sister (I can't remember) when he's like fifteen to fill the void of not having a mother. But a lot of things happen pertaining to complicated character webs and it's written in a beautiful, poetic way that CAN and will leave the reader confused. Especially involving the syntax of the novel. A lot of the love scenes, I've noticed, just stop and bounce to a completely different subject and I speculate it's because the author Shikibu didn't want to seem too entirely improper for her time. But that's just a guess. This is some heavy reading that I would recommend for people 18+, not for the reasons of ""sexual"" content but because of all the underlying meanings and little archetypes that could easily be missed by a less experienced reader and thus lose all purpose of plot.

Their society had innumerable rules about dress, behavior, decor etc. They had many gods and apparently never argued about religion. Although the women were subordinate, as in most ancient societies, they were given complete educations and were expected to know as much as a man, except that only men also learned Chinese.

Especially involving the syntax of the novel. A lot of the love scenes, I've noticed, just stop and bounce to a completely different subject and I speculate it's because the author Shikibu didn't want to seem too entirely improper for her time. But that's just a guess. This is some heavy reading that I would recommend for people 18+, not for the reasons of ""sexual"" content but because of all the underlying meanings and little archetypes that could easily be missed by a less experienced reader and thus lose all purpose of plot.

It is considered to be the first novel ever written(a little before 1000 A.D.) and, by most, the greatest work of Japanese literature.

330,0,0.19543859649122805,"This is an interesting look at medieval Japanese court society.  I read the kindle version and had no problems with this version.  I  found the notes very easy to use and it made going back and forth between the text and the notes seamless.  I also like the way the translator explained his word use in the poetry and also the way he explained his identification of the characters in the story.  The translator also used italics to differentiate between a characters thoughts and actions/dialogue.  While the story was interesting I found it more like a chronicle than a novel with a plot or theme.  Also there is a distinct difference in the writing style (and while the translator lists three possibilities for this I tend to go with the other author idea) at about the 2/3 point where Genji dies.  However, I found the last third perhaps more interesting as the story shows the impact of parents actions on their children.  All in all this is a good and worthwhile read, though definitely not a light or beach read.  I recommend it but it is not for the faint of heart due to its length."
331,0,0.12805904478035626,"The relative thinness of this book made me question its nature since previous versions I have seen of this tale were a lot thicker. Reading through the description more closely explained the discrepancy, this project only includes summaries, brief excerpts and explanations of what the tale is about rather than reproducing it in its entirety. The Tale of Genji was written by a Japanese noblewoman, Murasaki Shikibu. It combines prose and poetry, and “is widely considered” as “the world’s first novel”, the term novel here refers to this very combination of genres, prose and poetry, as prior works separated these two disciplines, and most earlier prose did not have some of the characteristics that we now recognize in the formula of a novel (a hodgepodge of all sorts of bits that come together to tell a single personal story). This volume is illustrated with paintings and calligraphy from the Genji Album (created by a famous court painter in 1510 in Kyoto) from the Harvard Art Museum’s collection, “the oldest dated set of Genji illustrations known to exist.” The author, Melissa McCormick is a professor of Japanese Art and Culture at Harvard. This is the first time all of these 108 paintings have been reproduced together. Given how long ago they were painted, and their beauty (surely, they would have made for a great pop children’s book) it is strange that nobody has attempted this collection before. These paintings were donated to a temple in 1516 and were not seen again before Harvard acquired it in 1957. The paintings are a bit postmodern in style, as they have some broken lines and strange perspectives. Some of the more standard Japanese art I have seen have much crisper lines and focus only on the main figures, but these images reproduce little flowers in gardens and display wrinkles in some of the characters’ faces. Some of this makes me question if there’s a chance this collection is a set of forgeries. It’s very strange that nobody has made note of it across so many centuries before it surfaced, and that nobody published these until now, and the style kind of reflects mid-twentieth century American art… But, I’m sure they’ve run the tests on these pages to date them properly. The book is elegantly designed, printed and put together. A cloth bookmark with gilded edges to remember a page one is on is particularly elegant; I miss these types of little bookmarks; I think this is the first I’ve seen in a book I’m reviewing in the last 100 books or more. The versions of the poems from the novel in English, transcribed in English in Japanese sounds, and then in the original Japanese (positioned in vertical stacks as in the original) are all very thoughtfully done. The commentary and summaries from the novel should help those who are taking a course on this novel to digest what it is about, and the relevant background. For example, near the end there is a description of a procession where Niou ignores the sisters, “even though they have been told to prepare for the prince’s visit”; this humiliates them. “Oigimi had already been doubtful of Niou’s intentions, but this indignity shames her to the core. She wants nothing more than to disappear, a goal she finally accomplishes by the end of the chapter when she loses all will to live and simply stops eating…” (211). If you want to find out what happens next, I guess you will have to read the novel or pick up a copy of this book. This book will benefit any library’s collection, as lacking these works of art or the first of all novels is a serious deficiency."

Hence when Edward Seidensticker’s translation appeared (1976), it became my preferred version."

365,0,0.10909090909090909,"Now comes the gift of a new translation, this one by Dartmouth professor of Asian Studies Dennis Washburn. In his enlightening introduction, Washburn states his overriding concern for “clarity and accessibility” and in this he has definitely succeeded."
366,0,0.1361904761904762,"Washburn does the first-time reader of Genji the favor of minimizing footnotes by including and explaining obscure details within the main text. He also uses the device of using italics to separate characters’ thoughts from their actions or statements. I have not quite finished reading the entire novel—-this version comes to 1,320 pages—-with no list of characters or illustrations—-but the few chapters I have sampled are certainly wordier than Seidensticker’s—-and in many instances, also easier to comprehend."
367,0,0.37916666666666665,"My quibbles—-if I may be so ungrateful as to mention them—-have to do mainly with style and word choice. While Seidensticker is terse, he is also more elegant.

While Seidensticker’s translation of Tanizaki’s Sasame Yuki (Makioka Sisters) is a masterpiece, his Genji labors; and Tyler’s pedantically accurate Genji often irritates - especially because he uses translations or eqivalents of ‘rank titles’ for the names of characters - and these vary from section to section as characters are promoted.  (Of course this is accurate to the text - Murasaki Shikibu’s actual use name is unknown to us - but it’s frustrating to the reader!)

From early childhood, Genji distinguishes himself by his precocious talent and his extraordinarily handsome looks; and therefore the Emperor, feeling that a formal tie to the imperium will actually hold Genji back, declares Genji a commoner – an arrangement that will, in theory, give Genji a chance to advance further on the basis of his own merits."

The Japanese word for “philanderer” is, 女たらし, on’natarashi, and author Shikibu’s attitude toward Genji’s many affairs is interestingly complex. There is often a wish-fulfillment element to fiction, as there is to myth; and it is easy to imagine some readers of ""The Tale of Genji,"" especially male readers, saying, “Well, if I were young, handsome, charming, socially prominent and rich, wouldn’t I…” At the same time, Shikibu unflinchingly presents a world where different rules exist for men and women when it comes to sexual behavior – a world rather like our own – and chronicles with a clear authorial eye the pain that Genji’s affairs cause for women like his first wife Aoi (the two are married when Genji is 12 and Aoi is 16). Moreover, some of Genji's ""seductions"" may seem, to a modern reader, more like rape.

In Genji’s case, the Minister of the Left is Aoi’s father, and therefore Genji’s father-in-law, and the Minister of the Right is a political rival to Genji. Genji is caught in bed with Oborozukiyo, the daughter of the Minister of the Right, and from that point forward, Oborozukiyo’s older sister, the Kokiden Consort who later becomes Empress Mother, becomes a bitter, implacable, permanent, and ever-more-powerful enemy of Genji."

Reading the abridgement has whetted my appetite to read the whole thing. I know that Genji’s reverses and recoveries in this abridged version, including an extended period of exile from the imperial court, only hint at the larger story covered in the 897 pages that I have not yet read, a larger story that Shikibu ultimately takes beyond the life of Genji himself."

Beyond those travel-related considerations, however, ""The Tale of Genji"" is purely and simply a great novel.

I had hand surgery this summer and have been discovering the joys of one handed reading with my Kindle. I thought this an ideal time to revisit an old favorite. Wrong. This sad, truncated version lacks complexity, depth and charm. It breaks off incomprehensibly before the deaths of Murasaki and Genji, and the whole last third of the novel, the most psychologically interesting part, is missing. There are parts that Tyler usefully omitted, like those concerned with poor dreary Suetsumuhana, but if I had encountered it in this form 50 years ago I would never have given it a second reading. Also I think I do not like the translation as well, but that is a judgement formed without the ability right now to compare this version with the other translations. My advice is go for Seidensticker. The Waley translation is my sentimental favorite but he for some reason left out a chapter."

As I learned more about Japanese culture and literature however, I began to feel  Waley’s version, wonderful as it is, did not sufficiently reflect the Japanese sensitivities so important to the enjoyment and understanding of this 11th century tale of the life and loves of the eponymous hero—-the Heian era’s Shining Prince. Hence when Edward Seidensticker’s translation appeared (1976), it became my preferred version."

492,0,0.10909090909090909,"Now comes the gift of a new translation, this one by Dartmouth professor of Asian Studies Dennis Washburn. In his enlightening introduction, Washburn states his overriding concern for “clarity and accessibility” and in this he has definitely succeeded."
493,0,0.1361904761904762,"Washburn does the first-time reader of Genji the favor of minimizing footnotes by including and explaining obscure details within the main text. He also uses the device of using italics to separate characters’ thoughts from their actions or statements. I have not quite finished reading the entire novel—-this version comes to 1,320 pages—-with no list of characters or illustrations—-but the few chapters I have sampled are certainly wordier than Seidensticker’s—-and in many instances, also easier to comprehend."
494,0,0.37916666666666665,"My quibbles—-if I may be so ungrateful as to mention them—-have to do mainly with style and word choice. While Seidensticker is terse, he is also more elegant.

While Seidensticker’s translation of Tanizaki’s Sasame Yuki (Makioka Sisters) is a masterpiece, his Genji labors; and Tyler’s pedantically accurate Genji often irritates - especially because he uses translations or eqivalents of ‘rank titles’ for the names of characters - and these vary from section to section as characters are promoted.  (Of course this is accurate to the text - Murasaki Shikibu’s actual use name is unknown to us - but it’s frustrating to the reader!)  So Washburn following Tyler so quickly is a relief, and a very worthwhile attempt. While his translation won’t have the cultural place that Waley’s has - Waley stands with Moncrieff’s Proust - it’s certainly a great thing to have!"

I  found the notes very easy to use and it made going back and forth between the text and the notes seamless.  I also like the way the translator explained his word use in the poetry and also the way he explained his identification of the characters in the story.  The translator also used italics to differentiate between a characters thoughts and actions/dialogue.  While the story was interesting I found it more like a chronicle than a novel with a plot or theme.  Also there is a distinct difference in the writing style (and while the translator lists three possibilities for this I tend to go with the other author idea) at about the 2/3 point where Genji dies.  However, I found the last third perhaps more interesting as the story shows the impact of parents actions on their children.  All in all this is a good and worthwhile read, though definitely not a light or beach read.  I recommend it but it is not for the faint of heart due to its length."

He ends up falling in love with his thirty something year old step mother who was his mother's cousin or sister (I can't remember) when he's like fifteen to fill the void of not having a mother.

A lot of the love scenes, I've noticed, just stop and bounce to a completely different subject and I speculate it's because the author Shikibu didn't want to seem too entirely improper for her time. But that's just a guess. This is some heavy reading that I would recommend for people 18+, not for the reasons of ""sexual"" content but because of all the underlying meanings and little archetypes that could easily be missed by a less experienced reader and thus lose all purpose of plot.

Today the Japanese themselves must, therefore, read modern renderings of the work."" This calls into question whether Puette could read Japanese. The Nara period had seven vowels expressed in ineffable man'yogana, but in the late Heian period when Genji was written, there were only five vowels and hiragana had already been adopted, not in its modern form, but in a form that corresponds precisely to the modern forms. Therefore, all six year old Japanese children should be able to sound out the original Tale of Genji, and indeed some of them do so. What makes the text so difficult is its 11th century grammar, literary allusions, and highly affected post-classical style."

I must recommend the Waley translation to the English-speaking world for being the friendliest read. If you want to read Genji purely for your own enjoyment, as the women of Lady Murasaki's era undoubtedly did, please consider the Waley translation. There is often a complaint that Waley's translation is inaccurate at times and omits passages. But it is not so inaccurate as to give you the wrong impression of the book, and not so frequent in omissions as to be called an abridgment. Furthermore, its charming Edwardian prose makes for an English story that is just as compelling as the Japanese original. Here's an example from chapter 29, when Genji meets with an elderly woman:"
631,0,0.2857142857142857,"Waley: ""She was evidently much enfeebled; but she was perfectly well able to carry on a conversation. 'I always know how things are going here by watching Yugiri,' Genji said to her. 'Lately he has been very absent-minded and depressed, and sometimes I have heard him sighing heavily when he was by himself. I knew this meant he was worrying about you, and I felt I must come and enquire on my own account.'"""

634,0,0.03854166666666666,"Both Seidensticker and Tyler have preserved the opaque language of courtly life, which requires a reread or two to figure out what is being said beneath all the formalities. Tyler has additionally preserved the long, complex sentences of Heian Japanese, and the failure to identify the speaker found in many passages of the original. Where Waley foregoes strict accuracy, it is to make the meaning of the passage clear and uncover the human emotion that pervades Genji's interview."

Once that is out of the way, the tale properly begins in the second chapter with the hero Genji, his rival To no Chujo, and two other young men telling war stories about their conquests. But because this is the middle of the Heian period and there is nobody to fight, the game is courtship and winning means getting behind the screen. To no Chujo knew a woman of exceptional beauty and taste named Yugao. He had a child with her but now both Yugao and the child are gone. Genji is entranced by what he hears and must have her. Such begins the cycle of discovery, courtship, possession, and loss that will be played out over three generations."
637,0,-0.004166666666666663,"  As with most Japanese literature, and Kawabata comes easily to mind, the plot is not nearly as important as the descriptions of setting and a heightened sensitivity for the beauty and sadness of things (mono no aware). Genji is the hero of the story (Kaoru, of the later part) not because of his exploits with women or his machinations at court, but because he is sensitive and articulate enough to communicate what usually cannot be put into words: that life is a sad business of ""unendurable beauty."""
638,0,0.12499999999999999,"  One would expect that after a thousand years, the novel would have lost much its relevance, but this is not the case. In fact, the surprising thing about The Tale of Genji is that it contains the core of what, for want of a better term, may be called the Japanese sensibility. This is not to be confused with the often-maligned notion of Japanese uniqueness. That is a political thing. The Japanese sensibility as manifested in The Tale of Genji is a habit of being coupled with an aesthetic sense."
639,0,0.10178571428571428,"  During Heian Kyo (794-1186), value was placed on a classical knowledge of Chinese poetry, the ability to play a musical instrument, handwriting that showed one's breeding and character, sensitivity to nature and the seasons, a sense of beauty, sportsmanship, duty, and charm. It was a time when matters of state where largely aesthetic questions about what color to wear or the proper classical allusion to fit the hour. In the chapter called ""The Picture Competition"" Murasaki writes, ""It was indeed a moment in the history of our country when the whole energy of the nation seemed to be concentrated upon the search for the prettiest method of mounting paper-scrolls."" These were the things that mattered."
640,0,0.10091575091575092,"  The extraordinary thing about The Tale of Genji is that what was once a chronicle of the lives of a few hundred select people living a thousand years ago has become the mythos for a nation of 128 million. It is almost as if the mannerisms of Heian court life have been replicated in every subsequent milieu. The hierarchy is still with us, as are the mannerly appeals, the focus on the seasons and the passing of time, the emphasis on duty, beauty, ritual, and charm. It is only that the values in the novel have been transposed into a hundred walks of life with seemingly no relation to the Heian period. But dig a little deeper, and they are there. They have just changed form. What Murasaki was able to capture and distill in The Tale of Genji was the fountainhead of a distinctly Japanese civilization (ochobunka). There have been other influences, to be sure, but no other single work of literature can possibly lay claim to being Japan's ""textbook in culture."" Once you have read Genji, you will see its influence everywhere."
641,0,0.205,"  The complete English translations weigh in at around 1100 pages each. Of these, the three principal ones (with their dates of publication) are those by Arthur Waley (1925-1933), Edward G. Seidensticker (1976), and Royall Tyler (2001). Although each has its own strong points, Waley's translation is especially noteworthy because it was the groundbreaking one. Before Waley published the first part in 1925, Genji was largely unknown in the West. After Waley's translation, all those people who had thought that the novel as a literary form had begun with Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740) or even Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1470) had to reset their timelines. Here was something of exceptional beauty written hundreds of years before the English novel had even been thought of."
642,0,0.2835714285714286,"  Waley's translation itself is a work of art. Critics have said that it was in fact too much art and not enough translation - that Waley had overstepped his bounds as a translator. But others, including Tanizaki Junichiro and Ivan Morris, have defended Waley. Morris writes: ""Arthur Waley's version of The Tale of Genji represents the freest possible type of translation. Indeed the word `re-creation' would be more appropriate; for he has brought Murasaki's novel to life as a great work of English literature in its own right."" This accounts for the strange feeling that you have while reading Genji that the novel is recalling works by Jane Austen, George Eliot, Dickens, and Hardy instead of prefiguring them."
643,0,0.15,"  Subsequent translators have sought to rectify some of the shortcomings of Waley's translation. Seidensticker (1976), for example, restored the forms of address commonly used at the time (the use of court titles rather than given names or surnames) and rendered the poetry in couplets set off from the text rather than as quotations within the narrative. Tyler (2001) went even further in following the original Japanese, choosing to offer the reader a great deal of supplementary material to flesh out a more literal translation. This supplementary material includes footnotes, illustrations, maps, a chronology, a glossary, as well as appendices on ""Clothing and Color,"" ""Offices and Titles,"" ""Poetic Allusions,"" ""Characters,"" and ""Further Reading."""
644,0,0.3277777777777778,"  Which should you read? I'd start with Waley's The Tale of Genji because this is a classic and reading Waley is a ""two-for-one"" proposition. Murasaki is here in all her brilliance but so is the guy who used to sit on the steps of the British Museum in between incredible flights of scholarship and imagination. After that, read Ivan Morris's The World of the Shining Prince. This will give you a good understanding of the Heian period. Then Seidensticker and Tyler. Finally, there is William J. Puette's very helpful The Tale of Genji: A Reader's Guide (Tuttle, 1983)."
645,0,0.09604884004884007,"I read this translation in comparison not only with the Royall Tyler translation but also the Edward Seidensticker and personally found that Seidensticker read most most fluently among the three. Seidensticker's first line read: ""In a certain reign there was a lady not of the first rank whom the emperor loved more than any of the others. ""Tyler's: ""In a certain reign (whose could it have been?) someone of no very great rank, among all His Majesty's Consorts and Intimates, enjoyed ecxeptional favour.

Denis Washburn's Introduction in the Waley translation was mainly a long synopsis of the story. The Waley translation is the only one of the three without illustrations. Non-Japanese reader may find the illustrations interesting if not informative, and they do evoke an atmosphere of ancient Japan as the reader is drawn into the fascinating story of love and intrique."
