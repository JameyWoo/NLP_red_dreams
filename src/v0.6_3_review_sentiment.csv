1,0,0.1058531746031746,"Any translation of a literary work, let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are, is an exercise in compromise and cleverness.  A particular sentence in Chinese—even a single phrase—can be rendered in numerous ways in English, each one of them carrying a different set of nuances.  To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.  That is the compromise.  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole."
2,0,0.215,"It is said that one should always translate into one's ""A language""—that is, the language in which one is most fluent.  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker, and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English, it was still not his primary language.  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original."

Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work, as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yan's Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.  But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist, Daoist, and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence.  So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.  Included also are scholarly citations that justify, with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader, all the various word and phrasing choices he made.  In some cases, Yu's study has even found errors in the original text."

These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu.

To my surprise, it appears to have been intended to be fun, and, despite the intervening centuries, I often found it such. The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before ""The Journey to the West"" was written. In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights. There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry, serving both as description and commentary, and the poetry lightened the reading.

I guess there are probably underlying political or social comments being made, but I am not that much of an historical or literary scholar.  This is a fun book to read, and one whose stories you can tell to young children and amuse them with their silliness.  The stories are filled with imagination and humor.  The monkey's high spirits grow on you.  His companions are often simple foils for his high jinx.  If you are interested in Chinese culture, this is a must-read, as there are many references to it in current Chinese culture."
10,0,0.25833333333333336,"I read the four-volume revised Kindle edition of this book, translated by Anthony C. Yu. The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a 7th century Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, during the Tang Dynasty. He undertook his famous, nearly two decade-long pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India. When he returned to China, he translated many of the original texts to Chinese, thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism. Some of the pilgrim's original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near today's Xian."
11,0,0.09935897435897442,"The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the (Handsome) Monkey King. Through various twists and turns, he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book. Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang - in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the 3 original Buddhist scrolls - from the Emperor's palace, the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk. In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples: Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo. To complete the mystical traveling company, a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitaka's deceased horse."

They encounter countless demons, spirits, monsters, dragons, and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka. This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs. With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk."

The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story. One can skip these paragraphs however, without losing much from the narration."
14,0,0.14020833333333335,"For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book. In my rough estimation 15-20% of the text may well be poetry. The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of, or clarifications to, the main story. As such, they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature, the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion. In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters' inner selves. I skimmed through many, but not all poems. Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details, will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book."

Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book!

To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.

It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original."

So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.

In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights.

The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature."

They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.

Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything.

From this point on the outlaws' activity becomes more and more focused on punishing corrupt officials though a lot of innocent lives are still lost due to their actions. Song is an unflinching loyal supporter of the Emperor, but he knows that the imperial court is full of corrupt, murderous ministers. Song's ultimate goal is to achieve amnesty from the Emperor so that he can put his outlaw army in the service of the country. Song Jiang builds up his corps of chieftains to 108 fearless warriors. Using his exceptional diplomatic sense he frequently recruits powerful imperial officers captured in battles. One thing I personally could not forgive of Song Jiang despite all his later gallant and noble actions is a murder he ordered. In order to recruit one of his chieftains, Zhu Tong, he had a child killed.

This second expedition comes at the extremely high price of the ex-outlaw army leaving only a fraction of its chieftains alive.

As with the three other great classic Chinese novels (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, The Journey to the West, and The Dreams of the Red Mansions), the sheer number of characters makes it hard to keep them straight.

With this acknowleged, one can view the book as an interesting way of learning the culture, beliefs, and character of both Song China and the China of when the book was created.

At times, the author uses the deux-ex-machina excessively, replacing heroes deeds with the favors of gods.  Some incidences are far fetched but comical and ought to be read that way. It could most easily be read as a light-hearted, sometimes farcical Robin Hood-esque tale.  Nonetheless, it has the standard ending to a Chinese novel."

Also, Shapiro's translation displays a grat deal of the ancient wit found in the classic, and the woodcut images provide an interesting look into Ming dynasty art.

The box which holds the four volumes is poorly constructed, but since it does not see much use it does not bother me too much.  However, it comes apart very easily and unless it is re-glued (or maintained through some other method) it will quite literally fall apart on you.

I can only think of a few other authors who have managed to do as such (Dante Alighieri comes to mind).  If the reader has read The Three Kingdoms, however, and expects to find a similar story, they will be disappointed.  Whereas The Three Kingdoms focuses more on the warfare and the political intrigue on a macroscopic scale (the politics between the three dynasties) with character development seen only connected with the overall plot, this tale tends to focus much more sharply on the development of the characters individually before it gets to the major plot line.  It is, however, still a wondrous masterpiece, and should be highly recommended to all who partake of classical literature."

It strikes an extremely American tone that echoes back through Westerns, Robin Hood, King Arthur, and all the way back to ""The Aeneid"" - just and gallant warriors fighting for the good.  There's just one problem.  These outlaws are not good.  A few are decent folks to begin with, but when they attack three straight towns to plunder their granaries, justified by ""they insulted one of our outlaws,"" it becomes clear to everyone but the translator Robin Hood's Merry Men they ain't.

The common people love these bandits, not because they ""take from the rich and give to the poor"" a la Robin Hood, but ""take from the rich and don't murder the poor.""  Oh, they burned half the city down and emptied the treasury and the granary, but they stopped massacring us average folks when their leader said so, so look how heroic and gallant these gallant gallants of gallantry are!

After the death of Chao Gai, a righteous man turned outlaw dies in a battle, an emerging new leader, Song Jiang takes over at Liangshan Marsh. From this point on the outlaws' activity becomes more and more focused on punishing corrupt officials though a lot of innocent lives are still lost due to their actions. Song is an unflinching loyal supporter of the Emperor, but he knows that the imperial court is full of corrupt, murderous ministers. Song's ultimate goal is to achieve amnesty from the Emperor so that he can put his outlaw army in the service of the country. Song Jiang builds up his corps of chieftains to 108 fearless warriors. Using his exceptional diplomatic sense he frequently recruits powerful imperial officers captured in battles. One thing I personally could not forgive of Song Jiang despite all his later gallant and noble actions is a murder he ordered. In order to recruit one of his chieftains, Zhu Tong, he had a child killed.

Eventually he is granted the desired amnesty from the Emperor and is sent to fight the Liao people at the northern border of the empire and later to beat down a rebellion in the southern part of the empire, led by Fang La. This second expedition comes at the extremely high price of the ex-outlaw army leaving only a fraction of its chieftains alive.

Although the depiction of violence may not be as graphic as in some modern books, it still could keep a few potential readers away. As with the three other great classic Chinese novels (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, The Journey to the West, and The Dreams of the Red Mansions), the sheer number of characters makes it hard to keep them straight. The similarity of the short Chinese names adds further complexity to this problem.

268,0,0.0,Setting:  The story takes place in China during the Song Dynasty.
269,0,0.042727272727272725,"Theme:  While many criticize it for the brutal justice which the outlaws enact, one ought to acknowledge that Song China was a different place at a different time and thus the opinion on what is due to someone differs from the common view of the average English reader.  With this acknowleged, one can view the book as an interesting way of learning the culture, beliefs, and character of both Song China and the China of when the book was created.  While this novel (very lightly) touches on Buddhist and Taoist transcendental philosophy, it primarily praises justice, loyalty, and honor."

The deepest vein of plot, that of leader Song Jiang, coincidentally follows the standard Nietzschean conflict of a man striving for excellence hated by those who envy and fear him, something which will endear the Western reader to this hero.  At times, the author uses the deux-ex-machina excessively, replacing heroes deeds with the favors of gods.  Some incidences are far fetched but comical and ought to be read that way. It could most easily be read as a light-hearted, sometimes farcical Robin Hood-esque tale.  Nonetheless, it has the standard ending to a Chinese novel."

The book chronicles their tales. For example, we learn of Lin Chong, an arms expert whose wife is desired by the evil marshall Gao's lecherous son. Teaming with Lin's childhood friend and oath brother Lu, Gao and his soon manage to gain a death sentence for the righteous Lin. However, Lin escapes their plot and joins up with the other outlaws.

Also, Shapiro's translation displays a grat deal of the ancient wit found in the classic, and the woodcut images provide an interesting look into Ming dynasty art. My only desire is that one of these days, our schools will have children read some of these tales, rather than the works of Pearl Buck (it seems reasonable to allow people their own impressions of ancient China rather than giving them the observations of another Westerner)."

The text was well-bound (all four volumes), though there were bits of glue that had seeped out from the spine (which was easily peeled off to no detriment to the book); this was also the case with the same publisher's book The Three Kingdoms.  The box which holds the four volumes is poorly constructed, but since it does not see much use it does not bother me too much.  However, it comes apart very easily and unless it is re-glued (or maintained through some other method) it will quite literally fall apart on you.  The actual books are much more stable and well-printed, even though the paper (also like The Three Kingdoms) is nothing short of being rice paper."

I can only think of a few other authors who have managed to do as such (Dante Alighieri comes to mind).  If the reader has read The Three Kingdoms, however, and expects to find a similar story, they will be disappointed.  Whereas The Three Kingdoms focuses more on the warfare and the political intrigue on a macroscopic scale (the politics between the three dynasties) with character development seen only connected with the overall plot, this tale tends to focus much more sharply on the development of the characters individually before it gets to the major plot line.  It is, however, still a wondrous masterpiece, and should be highly recommended to all who partake of classical literature."

So naturally, it would be easy to see Outlaws as the story of a hundred-odd men and women who, forced from civilized society by corrupt officials, band together and wreak just retribution in the name of Heaven against corruption.  It strikes an extremely American tone that echoes back through Westerns, Robin Hood, King Arthur, and all the way back to ""The Aeneid"" - just and gallant warriors fighting for the good.  There's just one problem.  These outlaws are not good.  A few are decent folks to begin with, but when they attack three straight towns to plunder their granaries, justified by ""they insulted one of our outlaws,"" it becomes clear to everyone but the translator Robin Hood's Merry Men they ain't.  And yet it's always ""gallant fraternity"" this, ""heroic gallant"" that.  Yes, we can have a plot where one bandit murders an innkeeper out of boredom, plunders the inn, complains he hasn't killed anybody two pages later, meets another bandit who ""likes to kill,"" and the translator takes that precise moment to talk about both thug's ""gallantry.""  The common people love these bandits, not because they ""take from the rich and give to the poor"" a la Robin Hood, but ""take from the rich and don't murder the poor.""  Oh, they burned half the city down and emptied the treasury and the granary, but they stopped massacring us average folks when their leader said so, so look how heroic and gallant these gallant gallants of gallantry are!

348,0,0.129298418972332,"The second section of the book seems to shift the emphasis from the earlier blind aggression to more selective confrontations. After the death of Chao Gai, a righteous man turned outlaw dies in a battle, an emerging new leader, Song Jiang takes over at Liangshan Marsh. From this point on the outlaws' activity becomes more and more focused on punishing corrupt officials though a lot of innocent lives are still lost due to their actions. Song is an unflinching loyal supporter of the Emperor, but he knows that the imperial court is full of corrupt, murderous ministers. Song's ultimate goal is to achieve amnesty from the Emperor so that he can put his outlaw army in the service of the country. Song Jiang builds up his corps of chieftains to 108 fearless warriors. Using his exceptional diplomatic sense he frequently recruits powerful imperial officers captured in battles. One thing I personally could not forgive of Song Jiang despite all his later gallant and noble actions is a murder he ordered. In order to recruit one of his chieftains, Zhu Tong, he had a child killed. (I guess with today's terminology the little boy would be referenced as a ""mushroom,"" or with a more upgraded term, a ""civilian casualty of a drone strike"")."

Indeed, his character development became one of the strongest attractions of the book for me. Eventually he is granted the desired amnesty from the Emperor and is sent to fight the Liao people at the northern border of the empire and later to beat down a rebellion in the southern part of the empire, led by Fang La. This second expedition comes at the extremely high price of the ex-outlaw army leaving only a fraction of its chieftains alive. The surviving members of Song's officers are properly rewarded by the benevolent, though mostly clueless Emperor however the conspiring ministers, led by Marshal Gao Qiu, have more murderous schemes up in their sleeves."

Although the depiction of violence may not be as graphic as in some modern books, it still could keep a few potential readers away. As with the three other great classic Chinese novels (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, The Journey to the West, and The Dreams of the Red Mansions), the sheer number of characters makes it hard to keep them straight. The similarity of the short Chinese names adds further complexity to this problem.

365,0,0.0,Setting:  The story takes place in China during the Song Dynasty.
366,0,0.042727272727272725,"Theme:  While many criticize it for the brutal justice which the outlaws enact, one ought to acknowledge that Song China was a different place at a different time and thus the opinion on what is due to someone differs from the common view of the average English reader.  With this acknowleged, one can view the book as an interesting way of learning the culture, beliefs, and character of both Song China and the China of when the book was created.  While this novel (very lightly) touches on Buddhist and Taoist transcendental philosophy, it primarily praises justice, loyalty, and honor."
367,0,-0.055555555555555525,"Characters:  Although the novel has 108 protagonists, only about fifteen need to be remembered.  Each of the main characters is wonderfully developed and his or her personality is learned through their speech and action rather than a tersely put paragraph about their personality and claim to fame.  The author stays within bounds of making the badguys only as bad as they need to be."
368,0,0.06555555555555555,"Plot:  With many interlocking plots, some are good, some are bad.  The deepest vein of plot, that of leader Song Jiang, coincidentally follows the standard Nietzschean conflict of a man striving for excellence hated by those who envy and fear him, something which will endear the Western reader to this hero.  At times, the author uses the deux-ex-machina excessively, replacing heroes deeds with the favors of gods.  Some incidences are far fetched but comical and ought to be read that way. It could most easily be read as a light-hearted, sometimes farcical Robin Hood-esque tale.  Nonetheless, it has the standard ending to a Chinese novel."

You will finish this story quickly if you just focus yourself on reading it.

The ""Outlaws"" are a group of 108 which band together to fight in the name of the emperor and against government corruption during the Song dynasty. While certainly far from angelic, these people nonetheless fight for the Song dynasty as they are hunted as outlaws by the various nefarious factions of the corrupt Chinese empire. The book chronicles their tales. For example, we learn of Lin Chong, an arms expert whose wife is desired by the evil marshall Gao's lecherous son. Teaming with Lin's childhood friend and oath brother Lu, Gao and his soon manage to gain a death sentence for the righteous Lin. However, Lin escapes their plot and joins up with the other outlaws. Many such stories are chronicled in this fine work, which shares an author (Luo Guanzhong) with ""Three Kingdoms""."

While not quite as engaging as ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" (which I consider the greatest piece of literature ever created), ""Outlaws of the Marsh"" certainly deserves a place on any educated person's shelf. Also, Shapiro's translation displays a grat deal of the ancient wit found in the classic, and the woodcut images provide an interesting look into Ming dynasty art. My only desire is that one of these days, our schools will have children read some of these tales, rather than the works of Pearl Buck (it seems reasonable to allow people their own impressions of ancient China rather than giving them the observations of another Westerner)."

The text was well-bound (all four volumes), though there were bits of glue that had seeped out from the spine (which was easily peeled off to no detriment to the book); this was also the case with the same publisher's book The Three Kingdoms.  The box which holds the four volumes is poorly constructed, but since it does not see much use it does not bother me too much.  However, it comes apart very easily and unless it is re-glued (or maintained through some other method) it will quite literally fall apart on you.  The actual books are much more stable and well-printed, even though the paper (also like The Three Kingdoms) is nothing short of being rice paper."
381,0,0.08779166666666667,"The text itself is wonderful.  I have scarcely read such intriguing material which captures my attention so easily.  I can only think of a few other authors who have managed to do as such (Dante Alighieri comes to mind).  If the reader has read The Three Kingdoms, however, and expects to find a similar story, they will be disappointed.  Whereas The Three Kingdoms focuses more on the warfare and the political intrigue on a macroscopic scale (the politics between the three dynasties) with character development seen only connected with the overall plot, this tale tends to focus much more sharply on the development of the characters individually before it gets to the major plot line.  It is, however, still a wondrous masterpiece, and should be highly recommended to all who partake of classical literature."

So naturally, it would be easy to see Outlaws as the story of a hundred-odd men and women who, forced from civilized society by corrupt officials, band together and wreak just retribution in the name of Heaven against corruption.  It strikes an extremely American tone that echoes back through Westerns, Robin Hood, King Arthur, and all the way back to ""The Aeneid"" - just and gallant warriors fighting for the good.  There's just one problem.  These outlaws are not good.  A few are decent folks to begin with, but when they attack three straight towns to plunder their granaries, justified by ""they insulted one of our outlaws,"" it becomes clear to everyone but the translator Robin Hood's Merry Men they ain't.  And yet it's always ""gallant fraternity"" this, ""heroic gallant"" that.  Yes, we can have a plot where one bandit murders an innkeeper out of boredom, plunders the inn, complains he hasn't killed anybody two pages later, meets another bandit who ""likes to kill,"" and the translator takes that precise moment to talk about both thug's ""gallantry.""  The common people love these bandits, not because they ""take from the rich and give to the poor"" a la Robin Hood, but ""take from the rich and don't murder the poor.""  Oh, they burned half the city down and emptied the treasury and the granary, but they stopped massacring us average folks when their leader said so, so look how heroic and gallant these gallant gallants of gallantry are!  Yeah it gets old.  Quickly. How could the Chinese be so cynical that ""well they didn't murder US"" makes the bandits the good guys?  Turns out they weren't."

Meanwhile, the common people suffer or die all the same.  It's dark.  It's bleak.  It's not ""Chinese Robin Hood Except He Doesn't Give to the Poor and His Merry Adventures Striking Down Tyranny.""

Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book!

Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything.

Unfortunately, the stylistic glosses dominate, and many obsolete expressions are not glossed. If you have a good historical dictionary of Chinese baihua literature, you can supply the deficiencies. There is enough white space in the margins to add some of your own glosses. The characters (simplified) are larger, darker, and more uniform than in cheap reprints. And the paper is higher quality (no see-through). The novel is split into two (somewhat oversize) paperback volumes. Binding is strong but flexible, and the book can be folded like a magazine while reading. You will need a solid surface if you record your own glosses. This is probably the best Shuihu for old eyes (anyone who needs reading glasses), even if it does not quite qualify as a ""big character"" book.

Taken from the classic Chinese novel Outlaws of the Marsh, this epic Shaw Brothers production follows the story of vengeance, betrayal & chivalry. The Liang Shan heroes wants bloody revenge for the death of their brother Heavenly King at the hands of Golden Spear. The only one capable of dealing with him is the well respected Jade Unicorn. So the heroes put forth a plan to get him to join up with them but was thwarted by Jade Unicorn's adopted son The Prodigy. When his wife & servant sells him out to the authorities, a few escape attempts & plots to assassinate him lead up to the grand climax of a deadly showdown between the heroes & Golden Spear plus his disciples."

Whereas 7 Blows of the Dragon, the English dubbed version, is not even 90 minutes long & contains more nudity & cursing which us Westerners crave (being facetious of course). With this version, it makes sense of the deception & the conniving of Jade Unicorn's treacherous wife & the chief servant. It also includes Timely Rain's (one of the elders of the Liang Shan heroes) prison visit as well as why those 2 prison guards kept assisting Jade Unicorn."

The fighting is not that good or plentiful, even for an early 70's film it lacks in this area; and it's also mainly army vs army as opposed to individual kung fu fights.  If you watch this, the interest lies more in its story, characters, actors, situations, and pageantry rather than the martial arts action(but there is enough of that if you don't expect or demand wall-to-wall fights)."

There is no option to hear that theme music anywhere on the disc.  I was really hoping to hear it on my theater system with digital quality.

After the death of Chao Gai, a righteous man turned outlaw dies in a battle, an emerging new leader, Song Jiang takes over at Liangshan Marsh. From this point on the outlaws' activity becomes more and more focused on punishing corrupt officials though a lot of innocent lives are still lost due to their actions. Song is an unflinching loyal supporter of the Emperor, but he knows that the imperial court is full of corrupt, murderous ministers. Song's ultimate goal is to achieve amnesty from the Emperor so that he can put his outlaw army in the service of the country. Song Jiang builds up his corps of chieftains to 108 fearless warriors. Using his exceptional diplomatic sense he frequently recruits powerful imperial officers captured in battles. One thing I personally could not forgive of Song Jiang despite all his later gallant and noble actions is a murder he ordered. In order to recruit one of his chieftains, Zhu Tong, he had a child killed.

Eventually he is granted the desired amnesty from the Emperor and is sent to fight the Liao people at the northern border of the empire and later to beat down a rebellion in the southern part of the empire, led by Fang La. This second expedition comes at the extremely high price of the ex-outlaw army leaving only a fraction of its chieftains alive.

As with the three other great classic Chinese novels (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, The Journey to the West, and The Dreams of the Red Mansions), the sheer number of characters makes it hard to keep them straight.

With this acknowleged, one can view the book as an interesting way of learning the culture, beliefs, and character of both Song China and the China of when the book was created.

At times, the author uses the deux-ex-machina excessively, replacing heroes deeds with the favors of gods.  Some incidences are far fetched but comical and ought to be read that way. It could most easily be read as a light-hearted, sometimes farcical Robin Hood-esque tale.  Nonetheless, it has the standard ending to a Chinese novel."

The book chronicles their tales. For example, we learn of Lin Chong, an arms expert whose wife is desired by the evil marshall Gao's lecherous son. Teaming with Lin's childhood friend and oath brother Lu, Gao and his soon manage to gain a death sentence for the righteous Lin. However, Lin escapes their plot and joins up with the other outlaws.

Also, Shapiro's translation displays a grat deal of the ancient wit found in the classic, and the woodcut images provide an interesting look into Ming dynasty art. My only desire is that one of these days, our schools will have children read some of these tales, rather than the works of Pearl Buck (it seems reasonable to allow people their own impressions of ancient China rather than giving them the observations of another Westerner)."

The text was well-bound (all four volumes), though there were bits of glue that had seeped out from the spine (which was easily peeled off to no detriment to the book); this was also the case with the same publisher's book The Three Kingdoms.  The box which holds the four volumes is poorly constructed, but since it does not see much use it does not bother me too much.  However, it comes apart very easily and unless it is re-glued (or maintained through some other method) it will quite literally fall apart on you.  The actual books are much more stable and well-printed, even though the paper (also like The Three Kingdoms) is nothing short of being rice paper."

I can only think of a few other authors who have managed to do as such (Dante Alighieri comes to mind).  If the reader has read The Three Kingdoms, however, and expects to find a similar story, they will be disappointed.  Whereas The Three Kingdoms focuses more on the warfare and the political intrigue on a macroscopic scale (the politics between the three dynasties) with character development seen only connected with the overall plot, this tale tends to focus much more sharply on the development of the characters individually before it gets to the major plot line.  It is, however, still a wondrous masterpiece, and should be highly recommended to all who partake of classical literature."

It strikes an extremely American tone that echoes back through Westerns, Robin Hood, King Arthur, and all the way back to ""The Aeneid"" - just and gallant warriors fighting for the good.  There's just one problem.  These outlaws are not good.  A few are decent folks to begin with, but when they attack three straight towns to plunder their granaries, justified by ""they insulted one of our outlaws,"" it becomes clear to everyone but the translator Robin Hood's Merry Men they ain't.  And yet it's always ""gallant fraternity"" this, ""heroic gallant"" that.  Yes, we can have a plot where one bandit murders an innkeeper out of boredom, plunders the inn, complains he hasn't killed anybody two pages later, meets another bandit who ""likes to kill,"" and the translator takes that precise moment to talk about both thug's ""gallantry.""  The common people love these bandits, not because they ""take from the rich and give to the poor"" a la Robin Hood, but ""take from the rich and don't murder the poor.""  Oh, they burned half the city down and emptied the treasury and the granary, but they stopped massacring us average folks when their leader said so, so look how heroic and gallant these gallant gallants of gallantry are!  Yeah it gets old.  Quickly. How could the Chinese be so cynical that ""well they didn't murder US"" makes the bandits the good guys?  Turns out they weren't."

But when the bandits gain power, no matter their ideals for performing ""Heaven's will,"" they end up no better than the officials they hunted down.  Meanwhile, the common people suffer or die all the same.  It's dark.  It's bleak.  It's not ""Chinese Robin Hood Except He Doesn't Give to the Poor and His Merry Adventures Striking Down Tyranny.""  It's complex, and one of humanity's greatest works of literature.  Too bad the translator completely missed the message."
