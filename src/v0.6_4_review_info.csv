0,0,I gave it as a gift.
1,0,"The Journey to the West is one of the Four Great works of Chinese literature.  Kathryn Lin retells this story in a format accessible to young, and very young children.  Each of the 37 pages of this book is richly illustrated with numerous, bright, eye-catching watercolors and drawings.  Although this is not a bilingual book, for  parents wishing to expose their children to Chinese language or culture at an early age, the author intersperses common Chinese characters (along with pronunciation and a concise definition)."
2,0,"The character of the Monkey King is reminiscent of Curious George. Or, one could say Curious George is reminiscent of the Monkey King.  I highly recommend this book to parents who want to familiarize  their children to another culture, especially those with children who already have an interest in Sagwa, Mulan, or other Chinese-themed children’s books."
3,0,"Beautifully printed, plain language and images to foreign readers to understand the ""Journey to the West"" story."
4,0,Amazingly well done and beautiful art. Great intro book for little ones to learn about the monkey king and his story
5,0,"Really cute book and easy to read. Pictures are watercolor and nicely done, bright. The length of it was also enough to be a good story time book. Good addtion for a child's library. Would recommend."
6,0,"What more could you ask for in a children's book? The beautiful illustrations will charm young children and parents alike. Lin brings the Monkey King to life, making him into a spunky, funny and lovable protagonist. Lin writes a Chinese story for a Western audience, providing parents the perfect opportunity to expose their children to a culture different from their own. How clever of Lin to write this story! Bravo."
7,0,What a treat!  I got it for my daughter and read the book to her before she goes to bed.  This version of monkey king is playful and child-friendly.  The pictures are colorful and fun.  My daughter enjoys the story as well as learned a few Chinese characters.  Highly recommended.
8,0,"Like the author, I also grew up with stories of the Monkey King, Wukong.  This is a great re-telling of story.  I love the illustrations!  I am buying a copy for my nephew."
9,0,Love the book! The story is interesting and fun. I bought one for my niece as her birthday gift. She really enjoys the story and learns Chinese words. Highly recommended!
10,0,"The best in the series in my opinion. Carries the legend forward and explores what only the poetry of the original probably ever has contained (at least in translation). Monkey is masterfully acted, and Gong Li is compelling as always. The writing is superb here, and this is what carries the upgraded special effects."
11,0,"Truly a A+ production in all respects. This installment doesn't play down the more serious side of Journey to the West, and that is much of why I see it as the most balanced and loving interpretation from this series and in relation to all others on film to date."
12,0,I loved the original Monkey King. This was like reading one a children's book. I should have read that it was in Chinese and not dubbed.. but it did have subtitles..
13,0,"This is an excellent and worthy continuation of the series that began with Donnie Yen portraying Sun Wukong, the iconic Monkey King, with Aaron Kwok taking over in the role and positively owning it. He doesn't let the special effects--of which there are lots and lots--outdo him at all. Gong Li makes for a sexy and seductive villainess who gets plenty of chance to shine as well. The Blu-Ray itself arrived in excellent condition in a most timely manner, and I'm pleased with how everything went, here! Definitely check this out--and it also adheres to the book pretty well, I might add."
14,0,"I love the effects, and like the story of this movie. It starts out with a monk who is attacked while on his journey, and trapped in a cave. Then he discovers Monkey King. Monkey King gets the monk to free him, and then he helps the monk escape his pursuers. Along their journey they come across a evil demon who wants to eat the monk to obtain immortality. Watch how they overcome her."
15,0,Was ok. Seemed like a rush from fight to fight rather than a nicely paced story. Most effects were done well. Subtitles may have lost a bit in transition. Worth a watch but don't expect to be wowed.
16,0,"Sequel to The Monkey King, Havok in Heaven. Watch #1 first, if you want it to make sense. Excellent production values."
17,0,We loved the first Monkey King Movie and couldn't wait to see the second. Loved it. English subtitles are so easy to get used to. Now own all three parts of the Monkey King series.
18,0,"Really enjoyed the movie. Always enjoyed the stories about the Monkey King. The story was predictable at certain points but, it flowed well. My only real problem was the brevity of the fights between the Monk's pupils vs the main villain's henchwomen."
19,0,I had wanted this mostly due to Gong Li who I consider a great actress and never disappoints. Have never seen any of the other Monkey King films before so plan to catch up on the others.
20,0,Very nice movie. I have liked Gong Li for a long time. Sexy sensual and good acting.
21,0,"[The Journey to the West (西遊記) is so well-known a story in Chinese culture that I won't bother to review the story as such, but will focus on the translation.  This book is the first volume of a four-volume translation.  This review covers all four volumes.]"
22,0,"Any translation of a literary work, let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are, is an exercise in compromise and cleverness.  A particular sentence in Chinese—even a single phrase—can be rendered in numerous ways in English, each one of them carrying a different set of nuances.  To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.  That is the compromise.  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole."
23,0,"It is said that one should always translate into one's ""A language""—that is, the language in which one is most fluent.  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker, and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English, it was still not his primary language.  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original."
24,0,"Something must be done with those nuances, though.  Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work, as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yan's Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.  But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist, Daoist, and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence.  So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.  Included also are scholarly citations that justify, with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader, all the various word and phrasing choices he made.  In some cases, Yu's study has even found errors in the original text."
25,0,"The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story, Wu Cheng'en's presumed authorship, biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel, and Wu's motivations for writing it, and them, the way that he did.  These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu.  Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English, but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard.  A must have for the dedicated reader."
26,0,"""The Journey to the West"" is a lengthy 16th century novel, regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature. The author of the book is uncertain, but is thought to be Wu Cheng'en. This volume contains the first twenty-five chapters of the hundred-chapter narrative, plus extensive notes and a ninety-six-page introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu. I found the introduction a difficult read, no doubt due to my prior ignorance about almost everything it covered. But the introduction was helpful, and I am glad I labored through it."
27,0,"The book itself defied my expectations. It was neither dry, nor dense, nor inscrutable. To my surprise, it appears to have been intended to be fun, and, despite the intervening centuries, I often found it such. The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before ""The Journey to the West"" was written. In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights. There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry, serving both as description and commentary, and the poetry lightened the reading. Since this volume contains only the first quarter of the story, I will postpone further comments for now."
28,0,"I've read Journey to the West, Yu's translation, every few years for the last decade or so now. It's wonderful, and improves with every reading. There are layers of meaning, and I really appreciate Yu's scholarly footnotes. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is a bit of a mess. The Chinese characters are FAR too small to read (they're smaller than the smallest-size font, and can't be resized). This is extremely frustrating, since much of the word-play, and some of the important concepts hinge on the characters used. This needs to be fixed."
29,0,"I'd say, if you haven't read Journey to the West, read it. But stick with paper for the time being."
30,0,"This is, of course, a great translation of a literary classic.  The stories of each scrape the monkey gets into are similar to fairy tales.  There is a strong moral lesson to the overall plot.  (The monkey is being punished for his flippant treatment of the staid conventional deities in Heaven.)  I guess there are probably underlying political or social comments being made, but I am not that much of an historical or literary scholar.  This is a fun book to read, and one whose stories you can tell to young children and amuse them with their silliness.  The stories are filled with imagination and humor.  The monkey's high spirits grow on you.  His companions are often simple foils for his high jinx.  If you are interested in Chinese culture, this is a must-read, as there are many references to it in current Chinese culture."
31,0,"I read the four-volume revised Kindle edition of this book, translated by Anthony C. Yu. The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a 7th century Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, during the Tang Dynasty. He undertook his famous, nearly two decade-long pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India. When he returned to China, he translated many of the original texts to Chinese, thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism. Some of the pilgrim's original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near today's Xian."
32,0,"The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the (Handsome) Monkey King. Through various twists and turns, he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book. Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang - in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the 3 original Buddhist scrolls - from the Emperor's palace, the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk. In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples: Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo. To complete the mystical traveling company, a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitaka's deceased horse."
33,0,"The bulk of the story is the description of the group's arduous traveling through impenetrable forests, burning mountains, and dangerous rushing rivers. They encounter countless demons, spirits, monsters, dragons, and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka. This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs. With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk."
34,0,"For the contemporary reader, the story has a few stumbling blocks, not the least of which is the length of almost 2400 pages. In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters. The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story. One can skip these paragraphs however, without losing much from the narration."
35,0,"For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book. In my rough estimation 15-20% of the text may well be poetry. The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of, or clarifications to, the main story. As such, they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature, the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion. In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters' inner selves. I skimmed through many, but not all poems. Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details, will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book."
36,0,"Of the four characters, the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not 3 but 4 stars to this book. He is an absolute riot; a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of self-adoration, self-assuredness, mischief, steadfast loyalty, courage, wisdom, practicality, and, on the top of everything, a great sense of humor. Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story: The Great Sage Equal to Heaven."
37,0,"Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings, the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed."
38,0,"Although the Tang Monk is formally the lead-hero of the story, he really pales in comparision to the Monkey King. He is the most benevolent, spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind. Unfortunately, he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King."
39,0,"Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen. He is stupid, yet quite capable in many ways. His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified, however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the high-minded Tripitaka."
40,0,"The character of the third disciple, Sha Monk, is far less complete than the previous three and doesn't deserve particular attention in this review."
41,0,"Overall, the book in its full length is not an easy read. I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world, namely the Tang Dynasty, from the perspective of a much later, but still very old, time, namely the late Ming Dynasty. What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure!"
42,0,An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest.
43,0,"Additional information: The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies, TV shows, stage plays, and comics. I saw one of these adaptations, Alakazam the Great. This Japanese cartoon film, although adorable in its own right, in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story. I've also read the Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein. The book adds a unique, modern-time perspective to this ancient story."
44,0,"A must read book for all avid readers around the world!  Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling book!"
45,0,"My 11-yr old boy loves it! He’s instantly hooked and enjoys sharing Sun Wuking’s adventures with me. I grew up reading it back in China but my son was born in the US and does not read Chinese, I’ve waited so long for him to appreciate Chinese classics! Thanks to the translator and Amazon!"
46,0,"This is part one of four volumes in Professor Yu's excellent translation of all one hundred chapters of the magnificent Hsi Yu Chi, one of the four great classics of China. The brilliantly detailed adventures, including sparkling battle scenes and characters that give today's well-known mercenaries and crime figures a run for their money, will shock those readers who thought all that started with Hollywoood. The details of bureaucracies laden with sloppy management and CEOs who remember and punish to excess everybody's mistakes but their own is a revelation. The words of the Monkey King's first teacher, ""Nothing in the world is difficult, only the mind makes it so"" underscore the deep spirituality on which this book is based, making it satisfying to read at this level as well."
47,0,"Some say a great work of literature is like a stunning piece of golden, bejeweled tapestry, and its best translation is like the reverse side of the cloth, same materials yet missing the design and jewels on the face. Therefore the awkwardness of some phrases and terms should not discourage the reader as they are to be expected.  I hope instead that such parts encourage usage of aids to understanding such as viewing versions of the story adapted for television and learning  to read some of the Chinese original.  This entire work is a very worthwhile investment, to keep in a very accessible area of the bookshelf where it can be referred to at each stage of one's life."
48,0,"A great translation, perfect for beginners just learning the story of the monkey king or for advanced students who want to study the text in more detail. This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture, and it gave me a familiarity with one of China's most beloved folk tales."
49,0,"For anyone into Chinese culture and Eastern  spirituality.  This is a tale (which I believe is non-fiction like everything else including the leprechaun) where you can compare yourself to the main character (Sun Wukong) and evolve with it, see yourself as a forever evolving leader. This monkey was not always godly but after learning lessons through pain you see the evolution of his character. This journey has many sub-characters too and I recommend you read this with patience and excitement both. It's a good laugh."
50,0,"What a fast, great read!"
51,0,"As a fellow late bloomer female motorcycle rider I was with her every step of the way.  Though I have not experienced the loss of a marital partner, I have suffered the loss of a relationship and understood the grueling process."
52,0,"Often our greatest growth is when we face our fears.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it shows that we are stronger than we give ourselves credit for when we step outside of our comfort zones.  The world is just waiting for us to show up and try new and different experiences."
53,0,"Good easy read. The pain of losing a spouse is horrendous. Linda found her own way through her pain. As a female rider with a stressful life - I have found riding to be a true attitude adjuster/de-stressor. I don't think about the stressful stuff and I can enjoy the beauty of God's handiwork. I enjoyed the fact that Linda could ""laugh"" at herself during her process of learning to ride and applied several examples of how our thinking process either helps or gets in our way. Linda gave very good examples of the skill set required for riding and I am glad her first trip was with riders that put safety first. This would be good for any women going through the grief process whether they plan to ride or not. I know women that have made ""new"" lives for themselves after loss and some that have not. The haves are much happier and healthier women. They still miss their husbands, but they have taken the steps to starting a new chapter by going back to work, new hobbies, etc. Good job Linda."
54,0,"This was an enjoyable read.  A rider myself, I especially enjoyed her descriptions of those difficult things that seasoned riders often forget -- multitasking, focusing, shifting on a hill, holding a curve, and avoiding gravel!  She did a great job and the link to her  personal journey was so nicely done.  In light of the path that continued, I have such respect for her ability to articulate and execute this publication."
55,0,Linda's discovery of herself after the death of her husband reads like a travel guide rather than self discovery. The Linda at the beginning is the same at the end for the reader.
56,0,"I was needing a good book to listen to as I drove 500 miles to see my mother. Blind Curves is entertaining and it's fun to hear about how a 57 year old woman can do something most would never try. Linda is not a typical new motorcycle rider. She signs up for a 2,500 mile road trip without knowing how to ride. And, it doesn't all go smoothly."
57,0,But Linda shows all of us that the only way to create something new in life is to tests old beliefs by doing something out of character.
58,0,"Now I'm ready to tackle some of those long-procrastinated ""wanna do's"" in life."
59,0,"This book was favorably reviewed in the BMW owners magazine and after reading it, I agree.  Great story of rediscovering meaning in life by taking on something new and challenging, and staying with it long enough to enjoy success.  My wife and I are both motorcycle riders, and easily identify with some of her experiences, but a non-rider would also find this an interesting book."
60,0,"Engaging books describing one middle aged woman's journay into self discovery. On an impulse she accepts an invitation to go on a multi day,  long distance  motorcycle trip despite never having driven a bike or having a motorcycle license. The book is both a travelogue  of the physical terrain  as well and  the inner landscape and  the interplay between the two"
61,0,"This novel of one woman's reinvention of herself holds much charm for the reader. I particularly liked the descriptions of how she learned to ride a motorcycle and the wonderful road trip of the Pacific NW she shared with 3 close friends. On the minus side, there was a bit too much soul searching interspersed with the action passages. However, for others in similar situations, that might just be the information they want and need."
62,0,I hope anyone who reads this understands motorcycle lifestyles as well as the need to make a decision when life throws a curve at you.
63,0,I am a female motorbike rider and former racer and enjoy reading about other female riders and the reason they ride.  This book was interesting in that Linda had never ridden a bike and had to learn from scratch before setting off on an adventure which took her out of her comfort zone.

83,0,"The character of the third disciple, Sha Monk, is far less complete than the previous three and doesn't deserve particular attention in this review."
84,0,"Overall, the book in its full length is not an easy read. I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world, namely the Tang Dynasty, from the perspective of a much later, but still very old, time, namely the late Ming Dynasty. What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure!"
85,0,An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest.
86,0,"Additional information: The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies, TV shows, stage plays, and comics. I saw one of these adaptations, Alakazam the Great. This Japanese cartoon film, although adorable in its own right, in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story. I've also read the Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein. The book adds a unique, modern-time perspective to this ancient story."
87,0,"A must read book for all avid readers around the world!  Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling book!"
88,0,"My 11-yr old boy loves it! He’s instantly hooked and enjoys sharing Sun Wuking’s adventures with me. I grew up reading it back in China but my son was born in the US and does not read Chinese, I’ve waited so long for him to appreciate Chinese classics! Thanks to the translator and Amazon!"
89,0,"This is part one of four volumes in Professor Yu's excellent translation of all one hundred chapters of the magnificent Hsi Yu Chi, one of the four great classics of China. The brilliantly detailed adventures, including sparkling battle scenes and characters that give today's well-known mercenaries and crime figures a run for their money, will shock those readers who thought all that started with Hollywoood. The details of bureaucracies laden with sloppy management and CEOs who remember and punish to excess everybody's mistakes but their own is a revelation. The words of the Monkey King's first teacher, ""Nothing in the world is difficult, only the mind makes it so"" underscore the deep spirituality on which this book is based, making it satisfying to read at this level as well."
90,0,"Some say a great work of literature is like a stunning piece of golden, bejeweled tapestry, and its best translation is like the reverse side of the cloth, same materials yet missing the design and jewels on the face. Therefore the awkwardness of some phrases and terms should not discourage the reader as they are to be expected.  I hope instead that such parts encourage usage of aids to understanding such as viewing versions of the story adapted for television and learning  to read some of the Chinese original.  This entire work is a very worthwhile investment, to keep in a very accessible area of the bookshelf where it can be referred to at each stage of one's life."
91,0,"A great translation, perfect for beginners just learning the story of the monkey king or for advanced students who want to study the text in more detail. This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture, and it gave me a familiarity with one of China's most beloved folk tales."
92,0,"For anyone into Chinese culture and Eastern  spirituality.  This is a tale (which I believe is non-fiction like everything else including the leprechaun) where you can compare yourself to the main character (Sun Wukong) and evolve with it, see yourself as a forever evolving leader. This monkey was not always godly but after learning lessons through pain you see the evolution of his character. This journey has many sub-characters too and I recommend you read this with patience and excitement both. It's a good laugh."

94,0,"I don’t dare begin raving about this book for fear I won’t be able to stop. I loved it. Interesting, engaging, and illuminating; it’s now one of my all time favorite reads. Can I give it six stars?"
95,0,"Let me begin by lifting a quote from the goodreads/publisher’s synopsis that absolutely nails it for me: “…Daughters of the Samurai is beautifully, cinematically written, a fascinating lens through which to view an extraordinary historical moment.”"
96,0,"Born a samurai, raised an American teenager, she died a Japanese princess. Sutematsu Yamakawa was born in 1860, in feudal Japan, into a family of the samurai class who were soon to find themselves on the losing side in Japan’s transformational, civil upheaval. [Emperor replaces Shogun, samurai class diminished/eliminated, liberalization/reform reigns (at least for a little while).] She would grow up to become the first ever Japanese female to attain a four-year college degree: A graduate of Vassar College, class of 1882."
97,0,Less than thirty years after Perry’s gunboat diplomacy had proffered our pacific overture for open trade to Japan.
98,0,"DAUGHTERS OF THE SAMURAI: A Journey from East to West and Back, by Janice P. Nimura, is largely Sutematsu’s story; the story of two other girls of Japan, Shige Nagai and Ume Tsuda, who also spent the years 1872-1882 in America, learning the ways and whyfors of the hairy barbarians; and so much, and some many, more. A story of a society, of a world, in major transition; and of three leading, albeit softer, lights in that transition. And it is an indescribably amazing read."

102,0,"As someone who has had a lifetime interest in the Asian martial arts, (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate-Do, Kendo, and Kenjutsu) cultural/educational arts (Haiku, Senryu and Tanka poetry) and historical aspects of Japan I am always seeking unusual and unique books on these topics."
103,0, I actually purchased this book on Amazon for a bargain price (Daughters of the Samurai: A journey from East to West and back by Janice P. Nimura) because my wife wanted to read it.  After she read the book she suggested that I read the book because of my interest in Japanese and American history.
104,0," This wonderful and highly informative historical tale tells the story of early Japan (1871) and how they sent men and women to America to learn our language and other educational topics in our schools (Grade, high school and college programs).  It was a time of great struggle for Japan who was trying to change from a feudal country to a modern society.  The turmoil was between the traditional Japanese cultural system promoted by the Samurai class to the modern western approach to modernization in Japan. This conflict led to many battles in the country."
105,0,"This is a story about three amazing girls sent by the Japanese government to America in 1871. These three girls came from the traditional Samurai families. This book chronicles the ten years they stayed in America learning English and other subjects and their return to Japan to become teachers (Sensei) focusing on the women’s education.  In the past, Japanese woman’s role was limited to taking care of the home and children.  Though I had read numerous historical books in the past on Japan this unique book covered areas I never had read bout in the other books."
106,0,This is a well written book that also has many photographs of the Japanese men and women who this book is all about.  Anyone interested in the history of Japan and the early American educational system will enjoy reading this book.
107,0,Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Zen Poetry Moments: Haiku and Senryu for special occasions).
108,0,"Janice P. Nimura’s wonderful book opens in 1871 with the empress of Japan dispatching three clueless girls - Sutematsu Yamakawa, age eleven; Shige Nagai, ten; and Ume Tsuda, six - to the United States. Their task was an almost impossible one: to learn the ways of the West so that their knowledge could be passed on to other Japanese women. Their journey lasted ten years."
109,0,"Nimura paints vivid portraits of each of the girls - the smart, overachiever Sutematsu, the arty Shige, the spoiled Ume. Two of the three end up at Vassar, with Sutematsu becoming the first Japanese woman to earn a American college degree."
110,0,"But back in Japan, they found a world turned upside down."
111,0,"“They were each of them, purebred daughters of the samurai,” the author writes, “they became hybrid by nurture,” not at home in America or their native Japan."
112,0,"“I cannot tell you how I feel,” Sutematsu said upon stepping foot in her native country, “but I should like to give one good scream.”"
113,0,Highly recommended.
114,0,"This is a slice of history unlike any other I have read. As Japan wrenched itself violently out of its medieval structure, five girls aged 7 to 12 were sent to the United States to live for a decade in which they were to become fluent both in English and western ways and then to return home to teach what they had learned to women in Japan. Given the almost random method of their selection, it is amazing just how well three of them succeeded, both here in the U.S. and then back in the still very tradition-bound Japan. An enjoyable and fascinating read."
115,0,"Janice Nimura provides a fascinating introduction to Meiji era Japan with its radical transition in Japanese society, through the lens of a group of young Japanese girls who travel to America to meet with President Grant and then return ten years later to a Japan that has partially transformed in their absence. Meanwhile, the girls have transformed also due to their exposure to the ways of Protestant New England and their western education. Every part of the book is full of surprises and delights. I found the return to Japan and the account of their later lives, sometimes divergent and sometimes intertwined, especially interesting."
116,0,"This book is about three remarkable Japanese women. Their stories are well told by the author. The three women --- Ume, Sutematsu, and Shige --- were chosen as children to take part in the transformation of Japan under the Meiji Revolution. In 1871, they were sent by the government to New England to be educated, charged with the mission of returning to Japan 10 years later to similarly educate Japanese girls and women. Ume, Sutematsu and Shige forged their own Japanese identities in New England and their own New England identities in Japan, becoming, in essence, global citizens of their own invention. At the core of their global citizenship was a strong and enduring sisterhood."
117,0,"An extremely interesting picture of the Japan that emerged under the Meiji Emperor and the ensuing effort to educate upper class women that led to the three principals being sent to the United States to study for ten years. The different paths they chose to follow upon returning to Japan reflected a struggle to balance their Western educations with Japanese tradition at the highest levels of society. The vignettes of the early days of Vassar and Bryn Mawr Colleges, which they attended, added to my enjoyment of the book."
118,0,"This is a fascinating book, the work of a serious historian with personal knowledge and care for Japan, its women, culture and relationship to the US over time. It's also a terrific story, illuminating a time when Japan changed from an isolated, closed society to one that looked outward for inspiration to modernize and to a small group of women to help make it happen. The men and women who brought about this change and the events leading to and from it come to life in Ms. Nimura's book."
119,0,"Strange Lands: America and Japan.  Five girls from Japan's military class are transported to America in the 1870's to be educated.  Not knowing English, they arrive at the East Coast of America to begin their Western education."
120,0,A compelling story is told.  History and culture of these two different worlds are highlighted through three lives of these strangers in strange lands.
121,0,"FASCINATING!  I've been researching this time period for some time on both fronts (American and Japanese) and this book both confirmed many of my theories and provided some extremely interesting additional information.  On top of that, it was absorbing reading even for a non-researcher and tells a story few people know about.  Extremely revealing of the thoughts and customs of the time."
122,0,Highly recommend it!
123,0,"Full disclosure: I met Bruce several years ago when we discovered we were neighbors. Over coffee, in our many conversations about the state of the world (or the state of our own worlds,) we’ve sometimes discussed this book, without discussing it...and though I sensed it, I didn’t know this for sure until I read Auspicious Journey: A Gift if Peace In a Time of War."
124,0,"I’ve read many books about soldier’s experiences in Vietnam. Most are centered around, or document, battle experiences and the associated drama. (I always bear in mind that war is unimaginable for those of us fortunate not to have had to participate, and books and movies tend to provide we voyeurs, a window.)"
125,0,"In the fictional accounts I’ve read in the past, the usual theme is good vs evil and they mostly center on only those doing the fighting. The documentaries also seem to focus on the soldier’s plight. The conflict. There are certainly plenty of stories to tell about that."
126,0,"Auspicious Journey is different, though. It’s a story of a soldier’s relationship with the indigenous population nearby and what he learns. These are a people who are so used to living with war around them, it’s much like how we tolerate the wind. The character, Dan wonders how they do this because he himself struggles to meet each day in the midst of the horror that is war. Through his interactions, he gains an awareness of the entry point of the WAY, and how this occurs is wonderfully portrayed by the author. He shares the wisdom of a villager that is not easily learned by western minds. And he shares a snapshot of a culture not easily understood by western minds."
127,0,"Auspicious Journey is in effect, a story of a journey to the beginning of another journey."
128,0,"The journey of the character Dan is actually Bruce’s. And in certain respects, it was mine too as I read this book."
129,0,"Because at the end, I smiled and felt peace."
130,0,"This book is a memoir of the Viet Nam War.  When he writes about 1968 I recognize the events of the time from the bubbles of memory inside my huge head.  I recall the wild times I spent with his writing partner, ""the Budman"", drinking beer and smoking reefers as we checked out exquisite California college girls.  While we were partying this poor guy was in Viet Nam.  Here's where the story gets really strange.  He gets a plum job.  He goes into enemy areas and sets up health clinics for refugees in dire straits.  Instead of hatred he radiates care and concern and compassion.  Instead of playing soccer with gook heads like soldiers I heard about late in the 2th infantry myself, he was trying to save them diseases of poverty.  He's definitely a fish out of water whether he's in the barracks with the boys or with the long lines of sick people waiting to see him in the jungle."
131,0,You'll get a good view of his dilemma.  Who's side is he on?  This book is important today as Americans have lost their empathy for refugees overseas even as it rediscovers its concern for citizens in peril from forest fires or hurricanes.  You'll literally shake with fear as you face a live grenade in the hands of a desperate deserter.  But most of all you'll gain respect for the author that keeps his honor when everyone around him seems to have lost it.
132,0,"Bruce Junior West tells a deeply affecting story of the Viet Nam War, especially his time in a particular village that he is assigned to as a soldier in the CeeBees (Construction Battalion).  He comes to know and understand the villagers and their values and finds himself wedged between them and the lack of understanding and concern for life displayed by members of his army unit.  The story comes from West’s service experience and is told with heart and understanding.  I enjoyed reading “Auspicious Journey” very much and learned a great deal from it about the war and these Vietnamese villagers."
133,0,"At first glance, Auspicious Journey seems aptly titled. It is a compelling story of a journey undertaken by Dan, a Navy Seabee stationed near Da Nang Vietnam during its civil war. Dan is assigned to Hoa An village as part of the American effort to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese."
134,0,"Instead, his beloved teacher, Ong De, and the patient, loving village elders win Dan's heart and mind. He discovers a way of looking at the world that is totally alien to the worldview in which he was raised. This inner journey causes Dan nothing but trouble. He is torn between the American and Vietnamese views of the war, and his confused loyalties continually cause conflict with his military cohorts."
135,0,"The resolution of the tension caused by juggling two world views occurs at the end of his journey, when Dan realizes he has acquired peace of mind and a means to make some sense of a chaotic and confusing war. This seems a pretty auspicious event in the life of a young GI in spite of the grief it caused him while he was in Vietnam. Dan was singularly blessed to experience this often meaningless war in a manner that leads to his moral and spiritual growth."
136,0,"But, will Dan be able to incorporate his new understanding into his life when he returns to the States? Or, will he be even more at odds with his birth culture? Will he look back on his Vietnam journey as auspicious, or as the source of his inability to be at ease within his own country? Perhaps Dan's journey has only just begun."
137,0,"Nothing is as compelling as a novel that provokes one to pause, reflect, ponder and envision the humanity of a setting described, experience the pathos and poignancy that it recalls, and to marvel at the gifted, inspired way that the picture is shared.  Lessons are always best when made available to be found, and not pitched as a package wrapped with a bow.  Auspicious Journey is one of the rare and profound opportunities to experience a place and time thru other’s eyes, while feeling their conflicting experiences of disorientation, peril and trust, wolven together with a simple but powerful potency."
138,0,"In this elegantly straightforward and compelling tale, the author invites your discovery of opportunities in life, but on your terms.  Storytelling, at its best, blends personal insights with the knack of bringing the reader along, as if there to watch the unfolding saga. Auspicious Journey is one such gift to be savored."
139,0,"Auspicious Journey confirms that hope can be kindled in the least likely places. West’s protagonist, Dan, heads off to war as reluctantly as a lot of Viet Nam soldiers did, but unlike so many, Dan brings an earnestness, a curiosity, a true appreciation of humanity. And upon meeting the villagers in one tiny Vietnamese village, he finds more humanity than he ever imagined."
140,0,"A dark story illuminated by compassion, insight and respect for the Vietnamese culture. Mr. West’s portrayal of a Vietnam soldier who fights to keep his spirit afloat in an ever more soul-crushing war is uplifting in spite of its subject matter. The writing flows with vivid, sometimes beautiful images that contrast with its startling pictures of the horror that is war."
141,0,"This is the second volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" As with the first volume, it is quite different than I'd originally anticipated. Far from being a dry, difficult, worthy tome, it is filled with taunts, trickery, battles, monsters, and a generous helping of poetry. The narrative is episodic and repetitive, but connections between the various events help thread it together. I had intended to read a chapter a day, but was often tempted into more. Although there is a great deal of violence, the tone is very light. Suffice it to say, I didn't expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water. A radical concept: literature is allowed to be fun."
142,0,This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows.  The characters are very popular.  I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic.  This is one of the four volumes translated by the author.  The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture.  The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetition--based on how the stories were told over the ages.  A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumes--but the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes.
143,0,"A must read book for all avid readers around the world!  Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling!"
144,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
145,0,"This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  It is, I believe, the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text.  Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture. Do not let this discourage you as you read, let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original. Seeing it via one of the many movies / TV productions available is a great help in enjoying this work.  I highly recommend the CCTV production from mainland China done in both 1986 and 2000."
146,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."
147,0,Love it !
148,0,CLASSIC!

151,0,"I'm reading this weekly with my third grade students. I personally enjoy the story, but can't believe how much they're into it. I thought without pictures I'd be in for some trouble because this is my first time with a Kindle book on the projector. Yet, it works."
152,0,"Initially, I began reading the story with my booming stage voice to keep them interested, but I looked around and saw ten hands raised. I thought they were just going to bug me about getting water so they could get away so I ignored them for a bit. Then, one student blurted, ""Can I read?"" Well...sure. This continued until just about everyone in the room read a page."
153,0,"Now, I read first and the others read it after I've completed a few pages. They're really into it and learning some huge words at the same time. But I don't have to define too much so it works out."
154,0,My class loves this.
155,0,"On a more personal note, I had no clue how much Dragon Ball ripped from Sun Wukong. I was amazed and thrilled to read it. It keeps me entertained with or without the kids. I get a little upset when they ask me a question while we're reading it."
156,0,"Short read, of course, but a classic. Shepard's info at the back regarding his adaptation and the research that went into this version is interesting...perhaps as interesting as the tale itself. As he says, this is a condensation or just a part of the whole story (probably by 吴承恩), which is available to read, but this is certainly able to stand on its own. Great thing about these tales is that the hero doesn't always come out on top...or come out as a hero. There are lessons to learn, we just have to seek them out."
157,0,A great introductory book to the many fables of the Monkey King.
158,0,It is fun. It is exciting. It is everything a little boy with special needs wanted.
159,0,"Not having any inkling of the Monkey King, this boy was introduced to its fables by word. Stories were told to him through memories and it is such a great feeling for him to actually have a book where his own mother could read and read again the fables."
160,0,"This is a humorous retelling of a 16th century Chinese tale, or at least this is what we are told. Monkey is a kind of superman, but he doesn't seem all that bright. His parent was a magic stone, which being a stone could not talk and never gave him a name. He served as a king for some four hundred years but became bored and wanted a higher position. He went to learn with the Patriarch who taught him magic arts and made him immortal. Then he decided he wanted to be a god. His adventures are sometimes ridiculous but always funny and many readers will enjoy them."
161,0,"The universally known stories in a culture have a profound and lasting influence in the mindset of growing children they are told to, and mark the continuity of tradition when repeated to their own children. This is true in every culture and this story is the ultimate in Chinese children stories. Not only does this story contain numerous character studies, conflicts and scenes that have entered into linguistic/world view idiom, but hidden inside this story are cryptic allusions to deep Buddhist and Taoist training. The full version of this story has 100 books and some authors have considered this story on par with such classics as the Tao-Te-Ching."
162,0,"This version is a good introduction to this story, the sort to give you a taste or to read to a child. I have a dozen versions of this story and while this is not my choice as the best short-popular version, it is close. Further, this author has released this text for the Kindle for 1 penny! This is the world's greatest bargain. Absolutely everyone should load this on their reader..."
163,0,As an aside...
164,0,"I hope that many like myself will purchase his dead tree version of the book and put it on their shelf, prove to publishers and Amazon that this is a good economic model. May many more authors release inexpensive e-book versions of texts as a promotion of their work. There is presently a vast quantity of high quality free audio books by authors trying to break in or grow their base, for traditionally published material. I regularly purchase texts that I have listened to or heard for free on the NPR Radio Reader program."
165,0,"I personally have been less than enthused with the universal $10 price for kindle books, the overall reading experience and utility is not the equivalent of a paper book. Given that 99.9% of the infrastructure costs such a printing, ink, paper, transport and warehousing are nonexistent for e-books, $10 is exorbitant.  I generally feel that if the paper back version of a book is available for $15 compared to a $10 Kindle e-book, I would unhesitatingly go with paper."
166,0,"There is a lot of inexpensive e-book content ""notably - Author 50-years-dead stuff"" but much of the contemporary less than $5 content is barely spam. I hope that the Kindle consumer community will spot and recommend high quality inexpensive content; review and recommend it to others. Vote with your voice and and wallet (mouse-click) for this content to knock publishers of their high-horse..."
167,0,"As a westerner, I didn't grow up with Monkey and Journey to the West, only coming across it as an adult. It's a great story, though, and as fundamental  to Chinese culture as the Grimm fairy tales are to Euro-American culture. I got this short book to read to my grandchildren so they wouldn't have to wait as long as I did to encounter this entertaining rascal."
168,0,Classic entertainment.
169,0,"If I'm not mistaken, this is adapted from 16th century Chinese lore.  It's the preamble to Journey to the West - a super-bizarre, larger than life superhero story about a badass super-strength monkey (named Monkey - what up creativity?) with a several-ton staff that changes size at will."
170,0,Anyone who's played the PS3 / 360 game Enslaved - it's a weirdly-adapted version of this story... kind of.
171,0,"This - and Aaron Shepard's entire series of culturally diverse children's story adoptions, are well worth a read."
172,0,"It makes me want to read its source material, which I gather was its point. I've always been a bit of a mythology fan, and Asian mythology is a fascinating contrast to the Greek/Roman and Norse that I'm most familiar with. One star off for feeling somewhat incomplete, though I suppose that was part of the plan for getting me to read the original."
173,0,"Aaron Shepard does for folklore and epic poems what Charles and Mary Lamb did for Shakespeare in the 1800's--produces short, exciting, plot-centered adaptations that make the originals accessible to readers young and old, and that may tempt you to dip into the real thing someday."
174,0,"Design and editing is admirable, too."
175,0,A good retelling of the origin of Monkey and an introduction to Chinese mythology that encourages you to learn more.
176,0,"What a fast, great read!"
177,0,"As a fellow late bloomer female motorcycle rider I was with her every step of the way.  Though I have not experienced the loss of a marital partner, I have suffered the loss of a relationship and understood the grueling process."
178,0,"Often our greatest growth is when we face our fears.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it shows that we are stronger than we give ourselves credit for when we step outside of our comfort zones.  The world is just waiting for us to show up and try new and different experiences."
179,0,"Good easy read. The pain of losing a spouse is horrendous. Linda found her own way through her pain. As a female rider with a stressful life - I have found riding to be a true attitude adjuster/de-stressor. I don't think about the stressful stuff and I can enjoy the beauty of God's handiwork. I enjoyed the fact that Linda could ""laugh"" at herself during her process of learning to ride and applied several examples of how our thinking process either helps or gets in our way. Linda gave very good examples of the skill set required for riding and I am glad her first trip was with riders that put safety first. This would be good for any women going through the grief process whether they plan to ride or not. I know women that have made ""new"" lives for themselves after loss and some that have not. The haves are much happier and healthier women. They still miss their husbands, but they have taken the steps to starting a new chapter by going back to work, new hobbies, etc. Good job Linda."
180,0,"This was an enjoyable read.  A rider myself, I especially enjoyed her descriptions of those difficult things that seasoned riders often forget -- multitasking, focusing, shifting on a hill, holding a curve, and avoiding gravel!  She did a great job and the link to her  personal journey was so nicely done.  In light of the path that continued, I have such respect for her ability to articulate and execute this publication."
181,0,Linda's discovery of herself after the death of her husband reads like a travel guide rather than self discovery. The Linda at the beginning is the same at the end for the reader.
182,0,"I was needing a good book to listen to as I drove 500 miles to see my mother. Blind Curves is entertaining and it's fun to hear about how a 57 year old woman can do something most would never try. Linda is not a typical new motorcycle rider. She signs up for a 2,500 mile road trip without knowing how to ride. And, it doesn't all go smoothly."
183,0,But Linda shows all of us that the only way to create something new in life is to tests old beliefs by doing something out of character.
184,0,"Now I'm ready to tackle some of those long-procrastinated ""wanna do's"" in life."
185,0,"This book was favorably reviewed in the BMW owners magazine and after reading it, I agree.  Great story of rediscovering meaning in life by taking on something new and challenging, and staying with it long enough to enjoy success.  My wife and I are both motorcycle riders, and easily identify with some of her experiences, but a non-rider would also find this an interesting book."
186,0,"Engaging books describing one middle aged woman's journay into self discovery. On an impulse she accepts an invitation to go on a multi day,  long distance  motorcycle trip despite never having driven a bike or having a motorcycle license. The book is both a travelogue  of the physical terrain  as well and  the inner landscape and  the interplay between the two"
187,0,"This novel of one woman's reinvention of herself holds much charm for the reader. I particularly liked the descriptions of how she learned to ride a motorcycle and the wonderful road trip of the Pacific NW she shared with 3 close friends. On the minus side, there was a bit too much soul searching interspersed with the action passages. However, for others in similar situations, that might just be the information they want and need."
188,0,I hope anyone who reads this understands motorcycle lifestyles as well as the need to make a decision when life throws a curve at you.
189,0,I am a female motorbike rider and former racer and enjoy reading about other female riders and the reason they ride.  This book was interesting in that Linda had never ridden a bike and had to learn from scratch before setting off on an adventure which took her out of her comfort zone.
190,0,Excellent print quality with many in-text Pinyin and notes for uncommon characters.
191,0,It.`s good!
192,0,"First off: I'm really glad this was an abridgment-- the 100-chapter, four-volume complete story sounds utterly overwhelming. I've read long books, and I've read the entire Harry Potter series multiple times, but classic books are at time more difficult to digest than modern novels."
193,0,"Secondly, remember that this story is hundreds of years old. Some of the story-telling styles are old-school. If you've read other ancient books and stories, you might know what I mean. It's not organized the way a modern story might be, and while it is entertaining, it had its own religious goals as well. But don't forget to enjoy the ridiculous antics the characters often take part in."
194,0,"This leads me to my next point: it helped me to have some background knowledge before reading this book. While the translator/editor of this book adds a few footnotes, it doesn't explain the basics. To enjoy this story more, I would recommend attaining a little background knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and ancient China. But no worries on becoming an expert! This is still an enjoyable story, at times adventurous and at times hilarious. I had to look up some things such as ""what does 'kowtow' mean?"" and ""what are the eight trigrams?"" and the like. But as I familiarized myself with this book and its contents, I began to understand some of the references to it. For example, I discovered that many animes draw on mythologies, including this story. Goku in Dragon Ball is based on the monkey of this book, as is a tailed beast in Naruto. Other references (especially in anime, but not exclusively) came not directly from this book, but from religious characters/items/stories/etc. mentioned in this book. I feel like I learned a lot both in reading this book and seeking to understand not only the story itself, but the background that goes into it."
195,0,This long but nevertheless abbreviation of the Chinese classic story of the journey from China to India of the Buddhist monk Tripitaka to bring to China manuscripts of the teachings of the Buddha.
196,0,"The characters are spectacular, especially Monkey whose magical performances save the mission from disaster. The bizarre adventures involving magic and courage are at times very amusing and always astonishing at the invention and imagination of those who wrote this amazing and highly readable, scholarly translated work."
197,0,"The story has been translated into many languages, made into films and simplified versions published for children."
198,0,Not to be missed.
199,0,"This is a distillation of Yu’s faithful translation of the 100 chapter, 4-volume The Journey to the West, the part historical, part mythical epic of Chinese literature which has been the basis for numerous movies, animes. and memes.  The essential first 8 chapters of the original, which tell how Monkey becomes a force to be reckoned with, are condensed to 7; most of the trimming comes after the divine monk Tripitaka Tang sets out to bring Buddhist scriptures from India back to China, since his encounters with obstacles become a bit repetitive in the long version."
200,0,"The monk is actually the incarnation of a Heavenly being who volunteered to suffer human birth in order to bring the means of enlightenment to the people of the East. But once he is mortal he will lose his divine perceptions and be vulnerable to illusions, deceptions, and wrong thinking, so he is assigned 4 assistants, all of them immortals who have fallen into disgrace one way or another. (Don’t drop a teacup or set fire to Heavenly curtains, and especially don’t steal all the peaches.) Their task is to transport him safely, thereby winning their freedom to return to their former estates. This assignment is made difficult by several factors. At least two of the disciples loathe each other and are forever squabbling and fighting. Pigsy is lazy and wants to go back to eating meat and having sex; Monkey wants to go back to being King of the Flower Fruit Mountain. Only the gold fillets that act like 16th century tasers keep the unruly disciples from rebellion. Thieves and politicians bar their way. The major difficulty, however, is that every monster who wants a short cut to immortality, bypassing all that tedious self-cultivation, wants to devour the monk, for it is widely known that even one mouthful of Tripitaka’s flesh will prolong life, and making a meal of him will bestow longevity. Time and time again Monkey exerts himself on the monk’d behalf, saving Tripitaka from hungry monsters who disguise themselves as damsels in distress or feeble patriarchs, when they don’t simply capture the travelers by a frontal assault."
201,0,"The story is magnificent adventure, incorporating poetry, allusions to esoteric medicine and meditation practices, breathtaking descriptions of travel, ferocious fight sequences, and braggadocio exchanges between combatants. It is so refreshing to encounter a classic that isn’t inherently a tragedy based on war or lust for power, thirst for revenge. Instead, this epic centers around a quest to benefit all of creation by promoting enlightenment. In the style of the poems included in this translation, here is a summary:"

220,0,This labor of love from Anthony Yu is an amazing translation for English readers!  In the preface Mr. Yu discusses his reasons for wanting to provide a culturally accurate translation for English readers.  Being a native speaker of Chinese and growing up in the culture as well as being a professor of Asian studies and history in an English speaking country is really what makes this translation so amazing.  The footnotes at the bottom of each page were an especially nice detail.
221,0,"Oftentimes with weighty classics like this all the footnotes are either at the end of the book with the appendices or at the end of the chapter.  This leads to a lot of fumbling around and flipping pages back and forth and can subsequently take you out of your reading experience.  It is also easier, at least for me, to forget some of the context of what I was reading doing all this flipping back and forth.  Not only do the footnotes themselves add immensely to the depth of understanding of the material but having them at the bottom of the page they are referencing makes reading easy and enjoyable.  Culture specific footnotes really helped me understand the intensity of the situations I was reading about as well as just how funny this book is."
222,0,As far as the story itself I think everyone should read it.  The story is hilarious and surprisingly modern in its storytelling despite the time it was written.  So many of the most famous animes in pop culture clearly have taken major inspiration from this story.  DBZ alone has ripped off so many elements you'll find yourself laughing at the similarities if you have ever watched DB or DBZ.
223,0,"Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!  Read now please!"
224,0,"GREAT book. I have never read the 1942 version but I imagine it must leave out a LOT. Considering Anthony C Yu's full unabridged version is 4 times the length of his here abridged version, this version is a great starting point. A must read for all interested in Chinese literature and a MUST for all Dragonball fans! You really get a sense of Goku and his world by reading this classic epic story."
225,0,Good translation and the abbreviated version maintains the spirit and I don't feel like I miss much by not purchasing each individual tome
226,0,"What a great book, I was sad when I got to the end that there was no more. Its amazing it was written hundreds of years ago and still has relevant moderns themes and insights. The mix of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism is special. Such an unusual story of myth, fairytale, proverb and religion, all with beautiful imagery and fun."
227,0,"I love 'Journey to the West' - the story is China's version of 'The Canterbury Tales', and the tales found within are both seminal works of Chinese literature and rewarding reads in and of themselves.  For this particular edition, Anthony Yu does a good job of translating into English: the prose text is very readable, and Yu's footnotes provide a lot of help on obscure references to Chinese superstitions and Buddhist heritage.  The translations of the poems are somewhat less satisfying, and I found myself frequently skipping over them to read just the prose storyline.  My main complaint is with the books Yu decides to include here: out of the 100 chapters of the full edition, Yu includes only the 31 chapters that are crucial to the plotline.  As a result, you get the barebones story, but some of the best-written and most comical subplots are left out.  All in all, though, a pretty good read, especially for anyone looking for the middle ground between the comic book versions and the full 4-volume 100-chapter text."
228,0,"Loved this version and sent it as a birthday gift to my son, who loved it as well. Great story to share with your kids. Recommend it all over the place."
229,0,Cool book. LOTS of typos. Is it hard to pay people to read these things before you publish them?

231,0,"I don’t dare begin raving about this book for fear I won’t be able to stop. I loved it. Interesting, engaging, and illuminating; it’s now one of my all time favorite reads. Can I give it six stars?"
232,0,"Let me begin by lifting a quote from the goodreads/publisher’s synopsis that absolutely nails it for me: “…Daughters of the Samurai is beautifully, cinematically written, a fascinating lens through which to view an extraordinary historical moment.”"
233,0,"Born a samurai, raised an American teenager, she died a Japanese princess. Sutematsu Yamakawa was born in 1860, in feudal Japan, into a family of the samurai class who were soon to find themselves on the losing side in Japan’s transformational, civil upheaval. [Emperor replaces Shogun, samurai class diminished/eliminated, liberalization/reform reigns (at least for a little while).] She would grow up to become the first ever Japanese female to attain a four-year college degree: A graduate of Vassar College, class of 1882."
234,0,Less than thirty years after Perry’s gunboat diplomacy had proffered our pacific overture for open trade to Japan.
235,0,"DAUGHTERS OF THE SAMURAI: A Journey from East to West and Back, by Janice P. Nimura, is largely Sutematsu’s story; the story of two other girls of Japan, Shige Nagai and Ume Tsuda, who also spent the years 1872-1882 in America, learning the ways and whyfors of the hairy barbarians; and so much, and some many, more. A story of a society, of a world, in major transition; and of three leading, albeit softer, lights in that transition. And it is an indescribably amazing read."

239,0,"As someone who has had a lifetime interest in the Asian martial arts, (Judo, Jujitsu, Karate-Do, Kendo, and Kenjutsu) cultural/educational arts (Haiku, Senryu and Tanka poetry) and historical aspects of Japan I am always seeking unusual and unique books on these topics."
240,0, I actually purchased this book on Amazon for a bargain price (Daughters of the Samurai: A journey from East to West and back by Janice P. Nimura) because my wife wanted to read it.  After she read the book she suggested that I read the book because of my interest in Japanese and American history.
241,0," This wonderful and highly informative historical tale tells the story of early Japan (1871) and how they sent men and women to America to learn our language and other educational topics in our schools (Grade, high school and college programs).  It was a time of great struggle for Japan who was trying to change from a feudal country to a modern society.  The turmoil was between the traditional Japanese cultural system promoted by the Samurai class to the modern western approach to modernization in Japan. This conflict led to many battles in the country."
242,0,"This is a story about three amazing girls sent by the Japanese government to America in 1871. These three girls came from the traditional Samurai families. This book chronicles the ten years they stayed in America learning English and other subjects and their return to Japan to become teachers (Sensei) focusing on the women’s education.  In the past, Japanese woman’s role was limited to taking care of the home and children.  Though I had read numerous historical books in the past on Japan this unique book covered areas I never had read bout in the other books."
243,0,This is a well written book that also has many photographs of the Japanese men and women who this book is all about.  Anyone interested in the history of Japan and the early American educational system will enjoy reading this book.
244,0,Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Zen Poetry Moments: Haiku and Senryu for special occasions).
245,0,"Janice P. Nimura’s wonderful book opens in 1871 with the empress of Japan dispatching three clueless girls - Sutematsu Yamakawa, age eleven; Shige Nagai, ten; and Ume Tsuda, six - to the United States. Their task was an almost impossible one: to learn the ways of the West so that their knowledge could be passed on to other Japanese women. Their journey lasted ten years."
246,0,"Nimura paints vivid portraits of each of the girls - the smart, overachiever Sutematsu, the arty Shige, the spoiled Ume. Two of the three end up at Vassar, with Sutematsu becoming the first Japanese woman to earn a American college degree."
247,0,"But back in Japan, they found a world turned upside down."
248,0,"“They were each of them, purebred daughters of the samurai,” the author writes, “they became hybrid by nurture,” not at home in America or their native Japan."
249,0,"“I cannot tell you how I feel,” Sutematsu said upon stepping foot in her native country, “but I should like to give one good scream.”"
250,0,Highly recommended.
251,0,"This is a slice of history unlike any other I have read. As Japan wrenched itself violently out of its medieval structure, five girls aged 7 to 12 were sent to the United States to live for a decade in which they were to become fluent both in English and western ways and then to return home to teach what they had learned to women in Japan. Given the almost random method of their selection, it is amazing just how well three of them succeeded, both here in the U.S. and then back in the still very tradition-bound Japan. An enjoyable and fascinating read."
252,0,"Janice Nimura provides a fascinating introduction to Meiji era Japan with its radical transition in Japanese society, through the lens of a group of young Japanese girls who travel to America to meet with President Grant and then return ten years later to a Japan that has partially transformed in their absence. Meanwhile, the girls have transformed also due to their exposure to the ways of Protestant New England and their western education. Every part of the book is full of surprises and delights. I found the return to Japan and the account of their later lives, sometimes divergent and sometimes intertwined, especially interesting."
253,0,"This book is about three remarkable Japanese women. Their stories are well told by the author. The three women --- Ume, Sutematsu, and Shige --- were chosen as children to take part in the transformation of Japan under the Meiji Revolution. In 1871, they were sent by the government to New England to be educated, charged with the mission of returning to Japan 10 years later to similarly educate Japanese girls and women. Ume, Sutematsu and Shige forged their own Japanese identities in New England and their own New England identities in Japan, becoming, in essence, global citizens of their own invention. At the core of their global citizenship was a strong and enduring sisterhood."
254,0,"An extremely interesting picture of the Japan that emerged under the Meiji Emperor and the ensuing effort to educate upper class women that led to the three principals being sent to the United States to study for ten years. The different paths they chose to follow upon returning to Japan reflected a struggle to balance their Western educations with Japanese tradition at the highest levels of society. The vignettes of the early days of Vassar and Bryn Mawr Colleges, which they attended, added to my enjoyment of the book."
255,0,"This is a fascinating book, the work of a serious historian with personal knowledge and care for Japan, its women, culture and relationship to the US over time. It's also a terrific story, illuminating a time when Japan changed from an isolated, closed society to one that looked outward for inspiration to modernize and to a small group of women to help make it happen. The men and women who brought about this change and the events leading to and from it come to life in Ms. Nimura's book."
256,0,"Strange Lands: America and Japan.  Five girls from Japan's military class are transported to America in the 1870's to be educated.  Not knowing English, they arrive at the East Coast of America to begin their Western education."
257,0,A compelling story is told.  History and culture of these two different worlds are highlighted through three lives of these strangers in strange lands.
258,0,"FASCINATING!  I've been researching this time period for some time on both fronts (American and Japanese) and this book both confirmed many of my theories and provided some extremely interesting additional information.  On top of that, it was absorbing reading even for a non-researcher and tells a story few people know about.  Extremely revealing of the thoughts and customs of the time."
259,0,Highly recommend it!
260,0,"These stories were well written and provide an insight into a religion unknown to many.  There were adventures and trials, sorrow and repentance, and a task accomplished.  Reading these stories helps all understand the benefits of a life worth living in a honest and righteous way. Many can benefit from a righteous life!"
261,0,"Awesome story! An irrepressible monkey character, seeking immortality and defying the very mandate of heaven, defying the gods themselves! A legend of freedom and bravery for the ages!"
262,0,Well written. Well translated. This book is a must! The monkey kings stories show you some insight on everyday battles that we all face. Maybe not in the form of a monkey or demons flying around. But to take a step back and rethink how you would normally do things.
263,0,Received as described and quickly but I should have done more research because this is not my cup of tea.
264,0,"For those who enjoy mythology and fantastic tales this book is for you. Plenty of fights and battles between supernatural warriors. However the story revolves around the Monkey's personal journey, first to gain the knowledge to become powerful and inmortal, then his naughty adventures as an inmortal disrupting heaven, earth and hell and finally to redeem himself by helping Monk Xuanzang from China get the Buddhist sacred scriptures from the remote West (India)."
265,0, This book is like a Kung Fu flick from the Tang dinasty and it's a delightful first step to study the chinese literary tradition.
266,0,"How fortunate for Hsuan-tsang, the priest traveling to the West to secure authentic Buddhist scriptures from India to carry back to China, that he encountered Monkey, and Pigsy, and Sandy, who helped him and guarded him throughout his arduous journey.

267,0,splendid insight into the stories that form part of the Asian character today.

269,0,Excellent!
270,0,This dude thanslates funny
271,0,"This is the second volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" As with the first volume, it is quite different than I'd originally anticipated. Far from being a dry, difficult, worthy tome, it is filled with taunts, trickery, battles, monsters, and a generous helping of poetry. The narrative is episodic and repetitive, but connections between the various events help thread it together. I had intended to read a chapter a day, but was often tempted into more. Although there is a great deal of violence, the tone is very light. Suffice it to say, I didn't expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water. A radical concept: literature is allowed to be fun."
272,0,This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows.  The characters are very popular.  I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic.  This is one of the four volumes translated by the author.  The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture.  The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetition--based on how the stories were told over the ages.  A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumes--but the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes.
273,0,"A must read book for all avid readers around the world!  Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling!"
274,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
275,0,"This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  It is, I believe, the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text.  Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture. Do not let this discourage you as you read, let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original. Seeing it via one of the many movies / TV productions available is a great help in enjoying this work.  I highly recommend the CCTV production from mainland China done in both 1986 and 2000."
276,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."
277,0,Love it !
278,0,CLASSIC!

282,0,"As a fellow late bloomer female motorcycle rider I was with her every step of the way.  Though I have not experienced the loss of a marital partner, I have suffered the loss of a relationship and understood the grueling process."
283,0,"Often our greatest growth is when we face our fears.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it shows that we are stronger than we give ourselves credit for when we step outside of our comfort zones.  The world is just waiting for us to show up and try new and different experiences."
284,0,"Good easy read. The pain of losing a spouse is horrendous. Linda found her own way through her pain. As a female rider with a stressful life - I have found riding to be a true attitude adjuster/de-stressor. I don't think about the stressful stuff and I can enjoy the beauty of God's handiwork. I enjoyed the fact that Linda could ""laugh"" at herself during her process of learning to ride and applied several examples of how our thinking process either helps or gets in our way. Linda gave very good examples of the skill set required for riding and I am glad her first trip was with riders that put safety first. This would be good for any women going through the grief process whether they plan to ride or not. I know women that have made ""new"" lives for themselves after loss and some that have not. The haves are much happier and healthier women. They still miss their husbands, but they have taken the steps to starting a new chapter by going back to work, new hobbies, etc. Good job Linda."
285,0,"This was an enjoyable read.  A rider myself, I especially enjoyed her descriptions of those difficult things that seasoned riders often forget -- multitasking, focusing, shifting on a hill, holding a curve, and avoiding gravel!  She did a great job and the link to her  personal journey was so nicely done.  In light of the path that continued, I have such respect for her ability to articulate and execute this publication."
286,0,Linda's discovery of herself after the death of her husband reads like a travel guide rather than self discovery. The Linda at the beginning is the same at the end for the reader.
287,0,"I was needing a good book to listen to as I drove 500 miles to see my mother. Blind Curves is entertaining and it's fun to hear about how a 57 year old woman can do something most would never try. Linda is not a typical new motorcycle rider. She signs up for a 2,500 mile road trip without knowing how to ride. And, it doesn't all go smoothly."
288,0,But Linda shows all of us that the only way to create something new in life is to tests old beliefs by doing something out of character.
289,0,"Now I'm ready to tackle some of those long-procrastinated ""wanna do's"" in life."
290,0,"This book was favorably reviewed in the BMW owners magazine and after reading it, I agree.  Great story of rediscovering meaning in life by taking on something new and challenging, and staying with it long enough to enjoy success.

292,0,"This novel of one woman's reinvention of herself holds much charm for the reader. I particularly liked the descriptions of how she learned to ride a motorcycle and the wonderful road trip of the Pacific NW she shared with 3 close friends. On the minus side, there was a bit too much soul searching interspersed with the action passages. However, for others in similar situations, that might just be the information they want and need."
293,0,I hope anyone who reads this understands motorcycle lifestyles as well as the need to make a decision when life throws a curve at you.
294,0,I am a female motorbike rider and former racer and enjoy reading about other female riders and the reason they ride.  This book was interesting in that Linda had never ridden a bike and had to learn from scratch before setting off on an adventure which took her out of her comfort zone.
295,0,"[The Journey to the West (西遊記) is so well-known a story in Chinese culture that I won't bother to review the story as such, but will focus on the translation.  This book is the first volume of a four-volume translation.  This review covers all four volumes.]"
296,0,"Any translation of a literary work, let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are, is an exercise in compromise and cleverness.  A particular sentence in Chinese—even a single phrase—can be rendered in numerous ways in English, each one of them carrying a different set of nuances.  To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.  That is the compromise.  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole."
297,0,"It is said that one should always translate into one's ""A language""—that is, the language in which one is most fluent.  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker, and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English, it was still not his primary language.  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original."
298,0,"Something must be done with those nuances, though.  Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work, as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yan's Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.  But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist, Daoist, and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence.  So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.  Included also are scholarly citations that justify, with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader, all the various word and phrasing choices he made.  In some cases, Yu's study has even found errors in the original text."
299,0,"The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story, Wu Cheng'en's presumed authorship, biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel, and Wu's motivations for writing it, and them, the way that he did.  These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu.  Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English, but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard.  A must have for the dedicated reader."
300,0,"""The Journey to the West"" is a lengthy 16th century novel, regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature. The author of the book is uncertain, but is thought to be Wu Cheng'en. This volume contains the first twenty-five chapters of the hundred-chapter narrative, plus extensive notes and a ninety-six-page introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu. I found the introduction a difficult read, no doubt due to my prior ignorance about almost everything it covered. But the introduction was helpful, and I am glad I labored through it."
301,0,"The book itself defied my expectations. It was neither dry, nor dense, nor inscrutable. To my surprise, it appears to have been intended to be fun, and, despite the intervening centuries, I often found it such. The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before ""The Journey to the West"" was written. In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights. There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry, serving both as description and commentary, and the poetry lightened the reading. Since this volume contains only the first quarter of the story, I will postpone further comments for now."
302,0,"I've read Journey to the West, Yu's translation, every few years for the last decade or so now. It's wonderful, and improves with every reading. There are layers of meaning, and I really appreciate Yu's scholarly footnotes. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is a bit of a mess. The Chinese characters are FAR too small to read (they're smaller than the smallest-size font, and can't be resized). This is extremely frustrating, since much of the word-play, and some of the important concepts hinge on the characters used. This needs to be fixed."
303,0,"I'd say, if you haven't read Journey to the West, read it. But stick with paper for the time being."
304,0,"This is, of course, a great translation of a literary classic.  The stories of each scrape the monkey gets into are similar to fairy tales.  There is a strong moral lesson to the overall plot.  (The monkey is being punished for his flippant treatment of the staid conventional deities in Heaven.)  I guess there are probably underlying political or social comments being made, but I am not that much of an historical or literary scholar.  This is a fun book to read, and one whose stories you can tell to young children and amuse them with their silliness.  The stories are filled with imagination and humor.  The monkey's high spirits grow on you.  His companions are often simple foils for his high jinx.  If you are interested in Chinese culture, this is a must-read, as there are many references to it in current Chinese culture."
305,0,"I read the four-volume revised Kindle edition of this book, translated by Anthony C. Yu. The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a 7th century Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, during the Tang Dynasty. He undertook his famous, nearly two decade-long pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India. When he returned to China, he translated many of the original texts to Chinese, thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism. Some of the pilgrim's original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near today's Xian."
306,0,"The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the (Handsome) Monkey King. Through various twists and turns, he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book. Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang - in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the 3 original Buddhist scrolls - from the Emperor's palace, the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk. In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples: Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo. To complete the mystical traveling company, a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitaka's deceased horse."
307,0,"The bulk of the story is the description of the group's arduous traveling through impenetrable forests, burning mountains, and dangerous rushing rivers. They encounter countless demons, spirits, monsters, dragons, and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka. This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs. With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk."
308,0,"For the contemporary reader, the story has a few stumbling blocks, not the least of which is the length of almost 2400 pages. In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters. The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story. One can skip these paragraphs however, without losing much from the narration."
309,0,"For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book. In my rough estimation 15-20% of the text may well be poetry. The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of, or clarifications to, the main story. As such, they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature, the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion. In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters' inner selves. I skimmed through many, but not all poems. Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details, will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book."
310,0,"Of the four characters, the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not 3 but 4 stars to this book. He is an absolute riot; a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of self-adoration, self-assuredness, mischief, steadfast loyalty, courage, wisdom, practicality, and, on the top of everything, a great sense of humor. Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story: The Great Sage Equal to Heaven."
311,0,"Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings, the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed."
312,0,"Although the Tang Monk is formally the lead-hero of the story, he really pales in comparision to the Monkey King. He is the most benevolent, spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind. Unfortunately, he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King."
313,0,"Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen. He is stupid, yet quite capable in many ways. His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified, however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the high-minded Tripitaka."
314,0,"The character of the third disciple, Sha Monk, is far less complete than the previous three and doesn't deserve particular attention in this review."
315,0,"Overall, the book in its full length is not an easy read. I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world, namely the Tang Dynasty, from the perspective of a much later, but still very old, time, namely the late Ming Dynasty. What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure!"
316,0,An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest.
317,0,"Additional information: The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies, TV shows, stage plays, and comics. I saw one of these adaptations, Alakazam the Great. This Japanese cartoon film, although adorable in its own right, in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story. I've also read the Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein. The book adds a unique, modern-time perspective to this ancient story."
318,0,"A must read book for all avid readers around the world!  Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling book!"
319,0,"My 11-yr old boy loves it! He’s instantly hooked and enjoys sharing Sun Wuking’s adventures with me. I grew up reading it back in China but my son was born in the US and does not read Chinese, I’ve waited so long for him to appreciate Chinese classics! Thanks to the translator and Amazon!"
320,0,"This is part one of four volumes in Professor Yu's excellent translation of all one hundred chapters of the magnificent Hsi Yu Chi, one of the four great classics of China. The brilliantly detailed adventures, including sparkling battle scenes and characters that give today's well-known mercenaries and crime figures a run for their money, will shock those readers who thought all that started with Hollywoood. The details of bureaucracies laden with sloppy management and CEOs who remember and punish to excess everybody's mistakes but their own is a revelation. The words of the Monkey King's first teacher, ""Nothing in the world is difficult, only the mind makes it so"" underscore the deep spirituality on which this book is based, making it satisfying to read at this level as well."
321,0,"Some say a great work of literature is like a stunning piece of golden, bejeweled tapestry, and its best translation is like the reverse side of the cloth, same materials yet missing the design and jewels on the face. Therefore the awkwardness of some phrases and terms should not discourage the reader as they are to be expected.  I hope instead that such parts encourage usage of aids to understanding such as viewing versions of the story adapted for television and learning  to read some of the Chinese original.  This entire work is a very worthwhile investment, to keep in a very accessible area of the bookshelf where it can be referred to at each stage of one's life."
322,0,"A great translation, perfect for beginners just learning the story of the monkey king or for advanced students who want to study the text in more detail. This book helped me learn about the role Taoism and Buddhism in ancient Chinese culture, and it gave me a familiarity with one of China's most beloved folk tales."
323,0,"For anyone into Chinese culture and Eastern  spirituality.  This is a tale (which I believe is non-fiction like everything else including the leprechaun) where you can compare yourself to the main character (Sun Wukong) and evolve with it, see yourself as a forever evolving leader. This monkey was not always godly but after learning lessons through pain you see the evolution of his character. This journey has many sub-characters too and I recommend you read this with patience and excitement both. It's a good laugh."
324,0,"Full disclosure: I met Bruce several years ago when we discovered we were neighbors. Over coffee, in our many conversations about the state of the world (or the state of our own worlds,) we’ve sometimes discussed this book, without discussing it...and though I sensed it, I didn’t know this for sure until I read Auspicious Journey: A Gift if Peace In a Time of War."
325,0,"I’ve read many books about soldier’s experiences in Vietnam. Most are centered around, or document, battle experiences and the associated drama. (I always bear in mind that war is unimaginable for those of us fortunate not to have had to participate, and books and movies tend to provide we voyeurs, a window.)"
326,0,"In the fictional accounts I’ve read in the past, the usual theme is good vs evil and they mostly center on only those doing the fighting. The documentaries also seem to focus on the soldier’s plight. The conflict. There are certainly plenty of stories to tell about that."
327,0,"Auspicious Journey is different, though. It’s a story of a soldier’s relationship with the indigenous population nearby and what he learns. These are a people who are so used to living with war around them, it’s much like how we tolerate the wind. The character, Dan wonders how they do this because he himself struggles to meet each day in the midst of the horror that is war. Through his interactions, he gains an awareness of the entry point of the WAY, and how this occurs is wonderfully portrayed by the author. He shares the wisdom of a villager that is not easily learned by western minds. And he shares a snapshot of a culture not easily understood by western minds."
328,0,"Auspicious Journey is in effect, a story of a journey to the beginning of another journey."
329,0,"The journey of the character Dan is actually Bruce’s. And in certain respects, it was mine too as I read this book."
330,0,"Because at the end, I smiled and felt peace."
331,0,"This book is a memoir of the Viet Nam War.  When he writes about 1968 I recognize the events of the time from the bubbles of memory inside my huge head.  I recall the wild times I spent with his writing partner, ""the Budman"", drinking beer and smoking reefers as we checked out exquisite California college girls.  While we were partying this poor guy was in Viet Nam.  Here's where the story gets really strange.  He gets a plum job.  He goes into enemy areas and sets up health clinics for refugees in dire straits.  Instead of hatred he radiates care and concern and compassion.  Instead of playing soccer with gook heads like soldiers I heard about late in the 2th infantry myself, he was trying to save them diseases of poverty.  He's definitely a fish out of water whether he's in the barracks with the boys or with the long lines of sick people waiting to see him in the jungle."
332,0,You'll get a good view of his dilemma.  Who's side is he on?  This book is important today as Americans have lost their empathy for refugees overseas even as it rediscovers its concern for citizens in peril from forest fires or hurricanes.  You'll literally shake with fear as you face a live grenade in the hands of a desperate deserter.  But most of all you'll gain respect for the author that keeps his honor when everyone around him seems to have lost it.
333,0,"Bruce Junior West tells a deeply affecting story of the Viet Nam War, especially his time in a particular village that he is assigned to as a soldier in the CeeBees (Construction Battalion).  He comes to know and understand the villagers and their values and finds himself wedged between them and the lack of understanding and concern for life displayed by members of his army unit.  The story comes from West’s service experience and is told with heart and understanding.  I enjoyed reading “Auspicious Journey” very much and learned a great deal from it about the war and these Vietnamese villagers."
334,0,"At first glance, Auspicious Journey seems aptly titled. It is a compelling story of a journey undertaken by Dan, a Navy Seabee stationed near Da Nang Vietnam during its civil war. Dan is assigned to Hoa An village as part of the American effort to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese."
335,0,"Instead, his beloved teacher, Ong De, and the patient, loving village elders win Dan's heart and mind. He discovers a way of looking at the world that is totally alien to the worldview in which he was raised. This inner journey causes Dan nothing but trouble. He is torn between the American and Vietnamese views of the war, and his confused loyalties continually cause conflict with his military cohorts."
336,0,"The resolution of the tension caused by juggling two world views occurs at the end of his journey, when Dan realizes he has acquired peace of mind and a means to make some sense of a chaotic and confusing war. This seems a pretty auspicious event in the life of a young GI in spite of the grief it caused him while he was in Vietnam. Dan was singularly blessed to experience this often meaningless war in a manner that leads to his moral and spiritual growth."
337,0,"But, will Dan be able to incorporate his new understanding into his life when he returns to the States? Or, will he be even more at odds with his birth culture? Will he look back on his Vietnam journey as auspicious, or as the source of his inability to be at ease within his own country? Perhaps Dan's journey has only just begun."
338,0,"Nothing is as compelling as a novel that provokes one to pause, reflect, ponder and envision the humanity of a setting described, experience the pathos and poignancy that it recalls, and to marvel at the gifted, inspired way that the picture is shared.  Lessons are always best when made available to be found, and not pitched as a package wrapped with a bow.  Auspicious Journey is one of the rare and profound opportunities to experience a place and time thru other’s eyes, while feeling their conflicting experiences of disorientation, peril and trust, wolven together with a simple but powerful potency."
339,0,"In this elegantly straightforward and compelling tale, the author invites your discovery of opportunities in life, but on your terms.  Storytelling, at its best, blends personal insights with the knack of bringing the reader along, as if there to watch the unfolding saga. Auspicious Journey is one such gift to be savored."
340,0,"Auspicious Journey confirms that hope can be kindled in the least likely places. West’s protagonist, Dan, heads off to war as reluctantly as a lot of Viet Nam soldiers did, but unlike so many, Dan brings an earnestness, a curiosity, a true appreciation of humanity. And upon meeting the villagers in one tiny Vietnamese village, he finds more humanity than he ever imagined."
341,0,"A dark story illuminated by compassion, insight and respect for the Vietnamese culture. Mr. West’s portrayal of a Vietnam soldier who fights to keep his spirit afloat in an ever more soul-crushing war is uplifting in spite of its subject matter. The writing flows with vivid, sometimes beautiful images that contrast with its startling pictures of the horror that is war."
342,0,"The Tang priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, along with their horse - a transformed river dragon - have to travel from the Tang court in China to the Western Heaven. Their mission: to retrieve the Scriptures from Buddha and deliver them to the Emperor. If they succeed, China will become a happy, prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued. But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils. In the end it takes 14 years; in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent, loyal team, win through dozens of unheard-of threats to life and limb, and achieve enlightenment."
343,0,"This is another long classic in the spirit of ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" that goes on and on with twists and turns that take you by surprise, except for the fact - spoiler alert! - that you know that the four heroes must eventually win through, deliver the Scriptures, and achieve enlightenment. A lot of the Buddhist hierarchy shows up unbidden, or is called upon for help by Monkey as he solves problem after problem on the journey West, so it's an entertaining introduction to those folks. The tone is lighthearted; even the constant threats to the Tang priest's life, as monsters try to capture and eat him (thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh) have a funny side."
344,0,"A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey; he's incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions, even in Heaven; but his heart is usually in the right place. His capabilities are vast, including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic, but his hubris often leads him astray. This is pitched as a children's tale - although the occasional sex and almost constant fairy-tale violence might make it an older children's tale - and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony. It's a fun read, and I was disappointed when it was over."
345,0,I'd recommend it!
346,0,"I currently own 3 different versions of ""Journey to the West"", and of the three, this one is probably the best compromise between detail and brevity. I am currently reading it to my 7-year-old (I read it by myself a while ago), and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch (I have to explain 4 or 5 words on most pages), he's really loving it. The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel, The Wizard of Oz, and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages."
347,0,"I previously read ""Adventures of Monkey King"" (ISBN 0962076511) to my son, and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child, the story was overly abridged, and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost."
348,0,"This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well, but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse, Pigsy, and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire.  As a result, Pigsy and Sandy are a bit under-developed, but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine, and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka, at least.  I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories, because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story (""Journey to the West (4-Volume Boxed Set)"", ISBN 7119016636), and fill in the missing stories if you want to."
349,0,"The way it's told here, the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story.  It's all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda.  In the full-length version, the story is mostly about the journey, and how it changes the characters."
350,0,"This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and ""find out what happens"", but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best, and aren't anxious for it to end.  Be warned, though, the full version can drag a bit if you're hoping to actually see the plot move along."
351,0,"I have heard that the book ""Monkey/Folk Novel of China"" (ISBN 0802130860) best captures the comedic aspects of the story, so that will be my next purchase."
352,0,"The British (well, really, Chinese via Japan) TV series ""Monkey"" is also based on this story. I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia, and that a British release is coming that will include the 13 previously unaired Japanese episodes (with subtitles). As the series was never aired in America, I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it, so that's what I plan to do. The story is that good."
353,0,"This translation skipped most of the adventures along the journey, which were the best part of this classic."
354,0,"Heavily shortened, it's alright overall but leaves a lot out.  Consider it a good primer for readers interested in the whole folklore of this legend, but there are better options out there."
355,0,"I have read the printed version of the ""Journey to the West"" before and thought it would be nice to have the eBook version for my Android.  It's like visiting old friends when I read about the Monkey King, Pigsy and the rest.  Plus, it's nice to be able to bring the book with me so I can read it when traveling or I have a few spare minutes."
356,0,I believe eBooks are definitely the wave of the future and this one makes a nice addition to my electronic library.
357,0,Thanks for reading.
358,0,Brad
359,0,"The book is difficult for most Western readers, because some of the language is so fantastic in its description of all the different spirits, monsters, immortals, etc.  But just stick with it and by the end of the book you will have an increased understanding of the mythology that works its way into a lot of Chinese Cultural opionions."
360,0,"I initially started reading this, because it is one of what is touted as one of the essential Chinese classics, and also because my wife, who is Chinese, was born in the Monkey Year, and I was born in the Boar Year.  The 4 main characters of the novel are Monkey, Pig, Friar Sand and the brother of the Tang Emporer.  My former business partner is named Tang, so, for me the book was irresistable."
361,0,"But, as I said, the book is very long, and the variety of monsters, spirits, immortals, etc. is mind boggling, but somehow, at the end it makes a unified impression, and from reading all the different subplots, you gain an understanding of Chinese culture that simply cannot be gained without it."

363,0,"tame the ego and magic appears, there are peaceful solutions to anything.  A delightful read of wisdom."
364,0,a wonderfully written book and full of life lessons.
365,0,The Journey to the West is a classic and its great read. Classic Chinese literature is poetic with life lessons all in a great adventure tale. The scene descriptions are hyperbolic but should be read as a tale being told to an audience.
366,0,Real good book I'm keeping it in my libary for good
367,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
368,0,"This is part three of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  If you've gotten this far you've undoubtedly found it hard to put down. This volume includes the episode of the fake Monkey King; it is a very gripping tale highly relatable to these modern times, where indeed the unreal makes as much if not more sense than the real. The CCTV Beijing production did a great job putting this and other tales from this volume on the screen."
369,0,It's not what you'd imagine from a journey novel. Challenges are overcome less so with violence and more with good ol' trolling. Fun to read!
370,0,"This is the third volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" The story continues to be fantastical, violent, and, despite its episodic nature, surprisingly compelling to me. I was reading the previous volume in parallel with Ken Liu's ""The Wall of Storms."" Once I started this third volume, I decided to shelve Ken Liu's book in favor of Tripitaka and Pilgrim's continuing adventures. For a Chinese classic published over four hundred years ago, the content is far less elevated and far more entertaining than I'd expected. Consider, for instance, this edifying quote, ""Even a fart is additional air!"" I am now impatiently waiting for Amazon to deliver the final volume."
371,0,"This is a wonderful translation of one of the Chinese classics. Don't be intimidated by the length, I never tired of the antics of the original Gang of 4. I felt like I had to pick this series up after seeing so many TV sets in Viet Nam with monkey and pig guys flying around on them, and I'm glad I did."
372,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."
373,0,A Must Read Book for Avid Readers Around the World!  Great story full of adventure that I wish I was a part of.
374,0,"This is a great story not just this volume, I really recommend these books to be read by anyone it has everything that a great -great story need."
375,0,Prepare yourself for a great journey...read the story.
376,0,"Of course, this is Chinese culture. If you know Sun Wu Kong you know Chinese people. This edition is scholarly and brings the Jenner edition up to date."
377,0,great novel.
378,0,"I think Aaron Kwok plays a great Wukong and the rest of the cast is good too, but this story was boring. A love story featuring Tripitika is not good, especially when it takes up nearly the entire film. The Monkey King 2 was far better. It had more action, better action and the relationship between the disciples was portrayed more effectively."
379,0,I really liked the first two movies in this Monkey King series.
380,0,"This one caught me off guard. It's pretty romantic which kind of throws a size-changing, galaxy-leveling staff into the the gear-working set-up by the first two movies. It wasn't that I disliked taking this part of the journey with the team, but it definitely wasn't what I was expecting and hope to find the 4th movie of the series more like the first two."
381,0,I guess the best way to put it is that this is more of Monkey King date-movie in the same way that (the much criticized but very fun) Alakazam the Great is a date-movie.
382,0,Now we have all three of the Monkey King story and we have enjoyed ourselves watching them. English subtitles are easy to get used to and the story line keeps you interested until the very last scene.
383,0,"Terrible story arc, acting and CGI... It seems that every movie in this series gets worse! Monkey King 1, was a masterpiece, number 2...bad, I mean really bad, and number 3... well to be fair, the acting and special effects are a much needed improvement over #2, but story is ...? Bad...! Just imagine that number 1 is the only one and skip parts 2 and 3."
384,0,"The first time I saw JOURNEY TO THE WEST, was the original version on TV. The actor who played Sun Wukong was so great, and he really had the movements of a monkey, and even though the technology wasn' t like it is not like it is now, the greatest versions of all of them. This one is all right and entertaining, I prefer ithe original and the 2009 remake off the original"
385,0,In the US we grew up with Superman.
386,0,"All over Asia, kids had the Monkey King."
387,0,(Monkey would win the fight between them)
388,0,These movies are fantastic and the third was the best yet in what I hope is a series of films that continues.
389,0,Another fantastic piece of the Monkey King Story bought to the big screen. This movie kept me laughing and sitting on the edge of my seat at times. This movie is a must have!
390,0,The Monkey King 3 was a bit of a disappointment when compared to the previous releases.  It had great special effects but I guess the story line loses something after the second movie.  I recommend the first two but not this one.
391,0,Love the synopsis and ending
392,0,Loved it! It was very entertaining. I saw the first two and wanted to watch this part too. It was as fun as the first two.
393,0,"If you loved Kung Fu Hustle, and enjoyed Shaolin Soccer, you will love this. It's what I call a ""sneaky romantic comedy"" - none of the ham-fisted, heartstring pulling that Hollywood is so fond of, but touching and heartfelt all the same. Plus, the action sequences, CGI, and ass-kickery are top-notch. You won't be disappointed."
394,0,"Stephen Chow does it again!  A unique masterpiece from Hong Kong.  I don't know where he gets his ideas, but he had me mesmerized for the entire film.  I felt the same about his previous classics ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"".  The humor is side-splitting.  Everything is so tongue-in-cheek but what has enhanced all of his films are the special effects.  Amazing characters, sound effects and soundtrack.  I never give you guys spoilers or plots.  Just watch this and judge for yourself.  The box cover is all I share!  ALL 5 STARS!  Chow is a Champion of film."
395,0,I admit i've been a Stephen Chow Fan for a long time and it definitely helps to know some of the comedic style and cultural references to the famous Journey to the West mythology that has been retold and remade so many times. And there are so many refreshing angles that Chow took that were pleasantly unexpected. I hesitated to invest time and money on one of Chow's not starring films!? Get out of here! Can't be good right? Wrong. His presence is so strongly felt even without his screen presence. The story just breezed by without any lulls and I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. For the non Chow initiated film collector looking for a audio visual feast you won't be disappointed with top notch graphics and action. The genius of his story telling and comedy is understandable to a wide audience. Example. His first scene there is an intense water battle which becomes a see saw balancing act (a visual reference we can all appreciate from our childhood) I can't wait to show this one to others. And maybe watch it in English next time. I watched in the original language with subs and I don't speak the dialect.
396,0,As a martial arts movie fan my expectations are set reasonably low. I want characters without too much depth and an easy to follow plot. This movie delivers! The abilities and powers of the fighters are delightful and the motivations perfectly one dimensional. Great for a lighthearted evening of popcorn and goofy laughs.
397,0,"While not the best of his films (like Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer) this is still a great film. Anyone a fan of his other stuff should give this one a shot. For those wondering, yes this does have an English Dub track. I watched this on Netflix and all they had was English Sub. So I was hesitant buying the blu-ray because some people said it had it, while others said it did not."
398,0,"If you're looking for the perfect movie to spend about 2 hours watching with the love of your life eating popcorn and sour patch kids.  This is the movie for you.  Make a memory, share a laugh, get excited, be afraid.  All that is possible with this movie.  Just know that once that two hours is gone you're going to ask yourself two important questions.  1) What the hell did I just watch?  2) Is there more where that came from, because I need there to be more."
399,0,The answers to those questions are. 1) Does it really matter?  That was freaking awesome wasn't it? 2) Yes.  Try Kung Fu Hustle if you haven't already.
400,0,"All the credit goes to his co stars Wen Zhang and Huang Bo. Who steal the show instanstly. From Stephen Chow, (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), brings his lastest and most crazy movie yet, Journey To The West. The story of Xuan Zang, taking his disciples on the journey to the west. But before the that comes just a simple demon hunter (Xuan Zang) trying to slay demons with nursery rhymes bringing out their inner goodness. More actors include Shu Qi as Miss Duan, Show Luo as Prince, Xing Yu as Fist of the North Star. And the brightest and biggest Zhang Chao Li as Almighty Foot. Stephen Chow has proved to become a huge success with his films and proved to be even crazier with his ideas making Journey to the west his most Outrageous movie yet."
401,0,"This is a well filmed movie based upon folklore. The writing and acting were over the top.  The action and Cinema Graphics blend so well and look as if your watching a reality show.  The movie is subtitled in English for the non Chinese speaking audience. A classic to be placed next to the Blind Swordsman.  This is really a funny, non stop action movie mixed with monstrous demons and hard kicking antiheroes. ."
402,0,"Anything Stephen Chow has a hand in is great.  I personally love Chinese fantasy movies and this one is truly an adventure in China's mythical past.  Reading Sub Titles does not take away from this movie or listen to it in English Dubbed, which is done very well on this film.  Take it from me go out and find other movies that Stephen Chow was involved in.  When he is a character in his or anyone's films it just rocks. If I had one super wish in life its would be to meet Stephen Chow, he has given me a great happiness in the roles he has portrayed, I wish he could make dozens of more movies before he decides to retire.  You can't beat him or Jackie Chan."
403,0,"This was very creative.. and very funny.. and I loved the actors, the direction, the dialogue.. the effects.. the jokes within jokes about any and all movies of this type. I wish the subtitles were EASIER.. I think they must test these on 20 year olds.. but that's often the case with subtitles so... not really bad."
404,0,I seriously recommend this movie. Anyone say 13 or over..although it's not sexy or dirty except in very mild ways.. in fact.. a couple of the scenes of romance are soooo funny I might even say go to age 11.
405,0,Really great flik!
406,0,"The thing that I found most absorbing about the story is the ongoing conflict between mutants and humans. it serves well as an allegory of the similar tensions between us humans who are different from one another, and is better done than the analogous conflict in our X-Men series. The more nuanced characters draw the line between good and evil more subtly; all of the ""good guys"" have their shortcomings and all of the ""bad guys"" have their redeeming qualities."
407,0,"There's a certain charm in the clumsiness of the production values. In the earlier episodes, the subtitles sometimes run by so fast that there's no time to read them. This is easily dealt with by stopping the movie and reading them, as I found necessary a couple of times. Also, the English is sometimes so stilted that it's a bit hard at times to get the meaning of what's being said, but again, I found that to be part of the charm. I never found a point where I was entirely unable to figure out the meaning."
408,0,"The special effects, while about 20 years behind those of the top Hollywood studios, are entirely adequate for the storyline. The martial arts sequences are the sort of over-the-top, highly scripted style of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (and not as well done as that): lots of flying around with wires and the like. But I didn't find them boring as I do in so many low-budget martial arts films because they never draw enough attention to themselves to overwhelm the story. This is a fantasy film with some martial arts sequences, not an martial arts film with some fantasy worked in."
409,0,"The story picks up momentum as the characters develop over the episodes, leading to a strong and very satisfying ending. And an ending that leaves you wanting more, setting the table for a new series that may yet come."
410,0,"I thought the story had promise, but I eventually stopped watching because the subtitles flashed across the screen so fast it was impossible to read them. If you don't mind pausing the video every time the subtitles change to keep them on the screen long enough so you can read them (or constantly stopping and rewinding to get what you missed), you might find the story enjoyable. But I finally just got fed up with it and quit watching it. Utterly exasperating."
411,0,"I said this series was weak, but for those who had a chance to read the original Monkey King Legend stories (or ""Journey to the West""), those are one of the most epic and complex novels in Chinese literature. That said, Trek of the Mutants did quite a fair job adding up comic elements. Despite the lameness of action scenes and drowsiness of the plot, I still managed to watch all the 6 chapters in one night, wishing there were more chapters to come."
412,0,"Just finished watching all six episodes. I do admit, I was skeptical at first, but it proved to be very enjoyable. If there are more installments, I would be interested in watching them, even if I have to pay for them- in case they are not included in Prime."
413,0,This show starts off as a really corny kung fu mystic show and turns a bit filthy when they get to the brothel.  Not cool.
414,0,Pretty low budget and effects suffer for it. Some acting is not very skilled and the subtitles are so fast it's hard to catch 20-40%
415,0,Enjoyed the series pleasantly surprised. I liked episode 3 the most. I hope they do more
416,0,"Loved the tying in of action, Asian religion, and comedy."
417,0,"First episode is the weakest, watch it all you won't regret it."
418,0,Enjoyed them all
419,0,Is six the last DVD
420,0,"A worthy follow-up to Steven Chow's 2013 film, this one sticks closer to the Monkey King story and lacks it's predecessor's downbeat ending.  Monk Tang is again the main character in this film, but there's plenty of Sun Wukong action as well.  I was initially thrown off by the re-casting of the roles, but the actors do a great job.  At least the gorgeous She Qi re-prised her role from the first film, if only for a brief cameo.  The combination of writer/producer Steven Chow and writer/director Tsui Hark serves the film well.  There is a lot of imagination and color on the screen at all time, and the film kept my attention at al times.  And they even managed to sneak in the episode with the spider demons, which was the basis for the old Shaw Brothers' Monkey King film ""The Cave of Silken Web!""  Plus, there were plenty of times when I broke out in belly laughs, which I've come to expect from any of Steven Chow's films.  I definitely enjoyed this film more than ""The Monkey King 2"" with Aaron Kwok, which was released around the same time.  I have to state, though, that if you do not have at least a slight familiarity with the Monkey King story you will probably be lost watching this film."
421,0,"Even as a Chinese viewer, the sequel is never as well made as the initial movie.  Being the second film in the series, the casting changes since the first movie were already irksome, add onto it, the even sillier screenplay (which is saying a lot when contrasted with the silliness preset by the first movie)."
422,0,Is it a bad movie?  No.
423,0,Does it require the suspension of disbelief as common to a Stephen Chow comedy?  Yes.
424,0,Should you be familiar with the tale of Journey to the West?  Most definitely.
425,0,Otherwise it'll just feel like a special effect filled B-movie :(
426,0,"Humor, elaborate CGI action scenes, and colorful cast of demons, the 2nd movie in the chow journey to the west series is in many ways what you would expect if you enjoyed the first one.  But while I did enjoy it, I would say its not quite as good as its predecessor.  This is mostly due to scripting, where what proceeds doesn't correlate with what happens next.  There's not much acting in the deception and without spoiling the whole first scene of the movie doesn't make sense in the context of the ending.  Also the first one felt like a movie, and fantastic as the action sequences were, this outing feels more like a filler tv episode than a major arc (plot wise).  I will say I have not read any of journey to the west so it is quite possible this is loyal to the original work so my review will only take the movie as the uncultured american watching it.  Despite my nitpicks everything else that I liked about the first one is in here and with it the move is still quite enjoyable.  The actors really nail the visual comedy providing performances that compliment the colorful and crazy world in which the story takes place.  The Demons have different forms and the movie seems to spare no labor in transitioning them from one to the other as it sees fit.  In the end what few flaws it has are eclipsed by the comedy and the set pieces which make the movie a fun journey indeed."
427,0,It’s not really a sequel to Steven Chow’s movie in anything but name and a superficial borrowing from the first “Journey to the West” with some  flashbacks from the first flick.
428,0,"The story, look, makeup, dialogue and characters don’t match the first one and the CG, soundtrack and cinematography don’t either."
429,0,It’s an ok movie but it’s not directed by Steven Chow and doesn’t have the same level of humor and cleverness to it.
430,0,It’s more like a B rate cash-in that Disney does with it’s straight to video sequels.
431,0,"If you get it, get it with that in mind. It’s not completely terrible but it’s not anywhere near the same league as “Kung Fu Hustle” or its predecessor."
432,0,"Horrible sequel. Acting style is different from the original and not even the same characters but alot of flashbacks to the original movie which made it more obvious. Comedy in original was organic and flowed well... this release the comedy was contrived and forced out of context ""just to be funny"". I loved the original but I had to stop this one after 30 mins and throw it in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did..."
433,0,So much fun.  SUN WU KONG RULES!
434,0,Very good scj-fi
435,0,"Just received the disk yesterday and planning to watch the whole movie with my husband this weekend.  One important and really happy discovery is that this movie has English language audio option, not just merely providing the English subtitle."
436,0,"In Disk main menu, Click the language menu.  There are audio and subtitle submenu.  In Audio submenu, you can choose to listen to this movie in English, Chinese or Thai.  In subtitle submenu, there are more language options available."
437,0,I really hope that Amazon will provide a list of the foreign films which offer English audio option when the customers doing a movie search.  Also very helpful is to provide this info in the description of the product.
438,0,"Not bad, good story and not too long."
439,0,"Saw the movie at the theater and I loved it. Lots of fun, humor and, literally, fantastic, epic action. Looks like different actors for the same characters, except for flashbacks of Shu Qi. Usually, that bugs me but since I saw this movie first..."
440,0,I gave it as a gift.
441,0,"The Journey to the West is one of the Four Great works of Chinese literature.  Kathryn Lin retells this story in a format accessible to young, and very young children.  Each of the 37 pages of this book is richly illustrated with numerous, bright, eye-catching watercolors and drawings.  Although this is not a bilingual book, for  parents wishing to expose their children to Chinese language or culture at an early age, the author intersperses common Chinese characters (along with pronunciation and a concise definition)."
442,0,"The character of the Monkey King is reminiscent of Curious George. Or, one could say Curious George is reminiscent of the Monkey King.  I highly recommend this book to parents who want to familiarize  their children to another culture, especially those with children who already have an interest in Sagwa, Mulan, or other Chinese-themed children’s books."
443,0,"Beautifully printed, plain language and images to foreign readers to understand the ""Journey to the West"" story."
444,0,Amazingly well done and beautiful art. Great intro book for little ones to learn about the monkey king and his story
445,0,"Really cute book and easy to read. Pictures are watercolor and nicely done, bright. The length of it was also enough to be a good story time book. Good addtion for a child's library. Would recommend."
446,0,"What more could you ask for in a children's book? The beautiful illustrations will charm young children and parents alike. Lin brings the Monkey King to life, making him into a spunky, funny and lovable protagonist. Lin writes a Chinese story for a Western audience, providing parents the perfect opportunity to expose their children to a culture different from their own. How clever of Lin to write this story! Bravo."
447,0,What a treat!  I got it for my daughter and read the book to her before she goes to bed.  This version of monkey king is playful and child-friendly.  The pictures are colorful and fun.  My daughter enjoys the story as well as learned a few Chinese characters.  Highly recommended.
448,0,"Like the author, I also grew up with stories of the Monkey King, Wukong.  This is a great re-telling of story.  I love the illustrations!  I am buying a copy for my nephew."
449,0,Love the book! The story is interesting and fun. I bought one for my niece as her birthday gift. She really enjoys the story and learns Chinese words. Highly recommended!
450,0,"This review will be one where I am not going to tell you what it is about, instead I will tell you that the performances are superb, the kung fu sequences are awesome as are all of the fight scenes. The costumes will blow you away and so will the scenery.  This is a visually stunning production and well worth the watching. So then you may ask why I only went for 4 stars? The ending was not an ending at all. It seems to have stopped and left whatever it is until a next movie and for the life of me, I can't find that next movie."
451,0,"This was way too good to be Hollywood. I'm astounded that this only rated 4.7 on imdb. This is the best movie I've seen in years. The special effects were amazing, but the creativity was in a realm of its own. There were so many gorgeous landscapes and cinematography scenes that I lost count. As an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader, I always complain about Hollywood's ritualistic adherence to uninspiring and pedantic formulas. This was a breath of fresh air in a world of stale cinema. Well done."
452,0,Loved the movie can't wait until part two comes out
453,0,This movie together with the Cult Muster are my least favorite movies with Jet Li. People who like sci fi may be impressed.
454,0,"Horrible story line, cgi look took fake"
455,0,Just a fun movie with kungfu inspired action and spectacular movie magic scenes
456,0,I loved the movie I glade that I am got it to watch when I want.
457,0,If yo are a fan of Asian Cinema you will enjoy
458,0,Amazing and Awesome Movie!!! Loved the Action and story!!! Great CGI!!! Must see movie!!!!
459,0,It was entertaining however jet li is not a main character
460,0,Excellent print quality with many in-text Pinyin and notes for uncommon characters.
461,0,It.`s good!

466,0,"Thank you, Ray, for a great read!  God Bless!"
467,0,Fr. Bob
468,0,"Great read. Realistic observations without the melodramatic BS ( You know 'THERE I WAS WITH A BIG GRIZZLY CHARGING FROM MY RIGHT AND A MOOSE CHARGING FROM MY LEFT) . His very realistic battles to keep his stove burning. that is no less deadly. The compassion of the others there; Warm you, feed you , advise you, send you on your way His use of space was educational to me. I continue to fill the space around me 'til there are pathways left. I will loan it to a friend who wants to go. and get it back so I can read it again. It points out Alaska is not for the faint of heart or the stupid."
469,0,"I love the honesty and integrity of this book!  His descriptions of the wilderness are drawn with real love.  The first third of the book, about what is needed in the North, got boring, but the rest of the book was worth it!  As an ex-Alaskan, this book rings True!!"
470,0,"If you want to know what's it like to live totally, (kind of,) on your own in a wonderful, horrible place like back country Alaska this book is for you."
471,0,"Got repetitive,,would have liked more detail about getting food, salary, cooking, etc. but still pretty good"
472,0,What a wonderful descriptive trip Ray takes you on as you travel with him on his experiences in Alaska. He pulls no punches as he describes his victorious decisions and the ones that defeated him. An enjoyable education on keeping your cool while enduring the best and worst of what Mother Nature can bring to you. A very enlightening read!
473,0,"Very interesting story about a strange and lonely, but voluntary, lifestyle."
474,0,I'm half way through and can't put it down. Good reading with alot of details.
475,0,"If you've ever wanted to visit the wilds of Alaska, even if only from your lazy-person chair, you must read this book.  Both highly entertaining and informative, it's the real scoop on a very real challenge with Mother Nature."
476,0,"Content is suitable for children to read, printing is very beautiful."
477,0,"I'm the author, and just want to write a brief intro to the book, and also break the ice and encourage other readers to submit reviews."
478,0,"This is our fifth book in the Journey to the West series, and in my humble opinion, they just keep getting better and better.  In this book we put one of the last major pieces in place before the actual start of the journey, which occurs in Book 6.  In this book, we start off with what appears to be a harmless bit of conversation between a fisherman and a woodcutter, as they stumble home after an evening of eating and drinking at a local inn.  Their conversation is overheard by a river spirit, setting events in motion that will eventually lead to the demise of a supposedly immortal being, and the entrapment in the underworld of the Tang Emperor.  It's a great story, and Xiao Hui and I had a wonderful time adapting it to our ""easy reading"" style.  We hope you enjoy it, and all the other books in the series!"
479,0,I travel in the region covered by this book a lot; over the years I have bought lots of guidebooks and other books about the area. Journey to the High Southwest remains my absolute favorite.
480,0,"I do not understand the comment of an earlier reviewer that it does not include  helpful ""tips"" for ""trip planning."" You might consider supplementing it with a more standard guidebook of the Frommer/Froder variety, but I have used Journey to the High Southwest since our very first trip to the area (early 1990s) and have found it a trove of ""useful tips."" On that first trip, using this book, I was able, for instance, to plan travel through the Hopi Reservation, where to stay, how to find out about when and where there would be dances, etc. The recommendations of where to stay/where to eat are terrific. (We would never have found our favorite hole-in-the-corner diner in Espanola without this book!) In addition to all the good travel suggestions, it's beautifully written, a mine of information, and a joy to read. I am so happy to find that there is an 8th edition!"
481,0,"A great narrative of the 4 corners area of the Southwest.  Filled with information to help visitors maximize their vacation experience.  There are plenty of other books that detail the parks but Robert Casey goes beyond that and gives a first person account of what he saw and enjoyed.  He provides travel road information, where to stay and eat recommendations that should give visitors plenty of options.  This book is definitely a must read and definitely take it with you when you visit the region."
482,0,"I know this book is a little outdated, so take that into account. I was planning a trip to the Hopi Reservation and had heard this was a good resource. This book definitely helped with our trip and I'll be using it for future trips to that area. Too bad it's out of print and a little difficult to find."
483,0,I haven't read this edition yet.
484,0,I read something like the 6th edition and found it the perfect guide to the region:
485,0,"Knowledgeable, readable, inspiring."
486,0,Great book to learn about the Four Corners area.  You can pick and choose which sections to read and the description of the geography is easy to follow.
487,0,If you're looking for photo advice and location recommendations skip this book.  The BEST source for that info is the series of books by Laurent Martres.  Check his books out here on Amazon.
488,0,"Even as a travel guide I was not really impressed.  Other than being broken down by huge geographic areas, the organization of the information in this book seemed disjointed to me.  I struggled with finding what I needed.  Now part of that struggle was because there is a LOT of information in the book, just not what I needed."
489,0,"The use of simple black & white line drawings of sites of interest rather than photographs added to a ""retro"" feel to me."
490,0,I bought this because of the glowing reviews but it is just not for me nor will it work for you if you are seeking help in planning a photo trip.
491,0,I bought the wrong book.
492,0,Excellent on many levels
493,0,"I bought this book to get some ideas for our family's summer vacation to the ""4-Corners"" area.  The book has alot of information, little of it very helpful for trip planning.  Most of the book is about the history, geology and nature found in each park.  Details of the actual parks are written in the narrative form as the author drove and hiked in the areas.  If you are willing to read through all this you might find a couple helpful gems and tips on your journey."
494,0,"I was previously a ranger at Mesa Verde.  This is without a doubt the best guide to the High Southwest that I've encountered.  For years I've recommended this to friends, and each time I've been thanked for giving them an outstanding, wide, yet in-depth, and well written  source of critical information about one of the most fascinating areas of our country. From where to go, what to see, and how to understand it -- from history, to geology, to ethnography, and much more -- this is an excellent introduction to the high country of our Southwest."
495,0,"I have been using this book for nearly 20 years.  It has plenty of ""inside tips"" and is essential for any sort of road-trip in this gorgeous area.  For the first-timer, it is indispensable.  For the veteran, it provides a rich set of fun possibilities...like driving from Zion to Capital Reef the back way, and a ferry in the middle of the desert.  Two additional interesting resources are the books of Tony Hillerman and an out-of-print AAA map called ""Indian Country."""
496,0,"Albarn comes through again with what I can only describe as a masterwork. While many of the pieces on this album are short (many are less than one minute long), the longer pieces are stunning and quite often moving beyond description.  The real gems here are:"
497,0,"*""Confessions of a Pig,"" which is a near-techno operatic lament that perfectly captures the tragedy of Pigsy's life (judging from the tone--can't speak to the lyrics as I do not speak Chinese)."
498,0,"*""Heavenly Peach Banquet,"" an incredibly engaging piece that has me mouthing faux-chinese lyrics along with it."
499,0,"*""Monkey Bee,"" for which I can only suggest a search of Youtube or Veoh for a copy of the video--it's Beijing Opera and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon meets Gorillaz (both visually and musically)"
500,0,"*""Disappearing Volcano,"" a denouement that manages to blast the listener with the perfect marriage of classical operatic themes and Chinese opera."
501,0,"Grab a copy of the book ""Journey to the West"" and this album.  The music will NOT get old even while reading all four volumes!"
502,0,"This is a fun album,  A Chinese opera, written by a Brit,  crazy right?  Don't be turned off by the opera bit,  this isn't stuffy or pretentious.  Beautifully layered, contemporary, nostalgic and discordant.  Damon Albarn has quickly become one of my my go-to artists when I want to listen to genuine quality."
503,0,"This is great. Very beautiful and unique. It's difficult to put it into a music category. It's the soundtrack to a Chinese opera by Jamie Hewlett and Damon Albarn. Wish I could have seen it! It's Damon Albarn (Blur/Gorillaz), but it's not pop. It's in Mandarin and has a definite traditional Asian sound, but with a modern twist. A nice break from the music we listen to everyday."
504,0,I just wish the songs were longer
505,0,Came early. Just as advertised
506,0,Great CD for a good price. Really enjoyed it.
507,0,some of the songs are kinda weird but great album!
508,0,Excellent
509,0,Great music and a fantastic album.
510,0,Great album!!
511,0,"First off: I'm really glad this was an abridgment-- the 100-chapter, four-volume complete story sounds utterly overwhelming. I've read long books, and I've read the entire Harry Potter series multiple times, but classic books are at time more difficult to digest than modern novels."
512,0,"Secondly, remember that this story is hundreds of years old. Some of the story-telling styles are old-school. If you've read other ancient books and stories, you might know what I mean. It's not organized the way a modern story might be, and while it is entertaining, it had its own religious goals as well. But don't forget to enjoy the ridiculous antics the characters often take part in."
513,0,"This leads me to my next point: it helped me to have some background knowledge before reading this book. While the translator/editor of this book adds a few footnotes, it doesn't explain the basics. To enjoy this story more, I would recommend attaining a little background knowledge of Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and ancient China. But no worries on becoming an expert! This is still an enjoyable story, at times adventurous and at times hilarious. I had to look up some things such as ""what does 'kowtow' mean?"" and ""what are the eight trigrams?"" and the like. But as I familiarized myself with this book and its contents, I began to understand some of the references to it. For example, I discovered that many animes draw on mythologies, including this story. Goku in Dragon Ball is based on the monkey of this book, as is a tailed beast in Naruto. Other references (especially in anime, but not exclusively) came not directly from this book, but from religious characters/items/stories/etc. mentioned in this book. I feel like I learned a lot both in reading this book and seeking to understand not only the story itself, but the background that goes into it."
514,0,This long but nevertheless abbreviation of the Chinese classic story of the journey from China to India of the Buddhist monk Tripitaka to bring to China manuscripts of the teachings of the Buddha.
515,0,"The characters are spectacular, especially Monkey whose magical performances save the mission from disaster. The bizarre adventures involving magic and courage are at times very amusing and always astonishing at the invention and imagination of those who wrote this amazing and highly readable, scholarly translated work."
516,0,"The story has been translated into many languages, made into films and simplified versions published for children."
517,0,Not to be missed.
518,0,"This is a distillation of Yu’s faithful translation of the 100 chapter, 4-volume The Journey to the West, the part historical, part mythical epic of Chinese literature which has been the basis for numerous movies, animes. and memes.  The essential first 8 chapters of the original, which tell how Monkey becomes a force to be reckoned with, are condensed to 7; most of the trimming comes after the divine monk Tripitaka Tang sets out to bring Buddhist scriptures from India back to China, since his encounters with obstacles become a bit repetitive in the long version."
519,0,"The monk is actually the incarnation of a Heavenly being who volunteered to suffer human birth in order to bring the means of enlightenment to the people of the East. But once he is mortal he will lose his divine perceptions and be vulnerable to illusions, deceptions, and wrong thinking, so he is assigned 4 assistants, all of them immortals who have fallen into disgrace one way or another. (Don’t drop a teacup or set fire to Heavenly curtains, and especially don’t steal all the peaches.) Their task is to transport him safely, thereby winning their freedom to return to their former estates. This assignment is made difficult by several factors. At least two of the disciples loathe each other and are forever squabbling and fighting. Pigsy is lazy and wants to go back to eating meat and having sex; Monkey wants to go back to being King of the Flower Fruit Mountain. Only the gold fillets that act like 16th century tasers keep the unruly disciples from rebellion. Thieves and politicians bar their way. The major difficulty, however, is that every monster who wants a short cut to immortality, bypassing all that tedious self-cultivation, wants to devour the monk, for it is widely known that even one mouthful of Tripitaka’s flesh will prolong life, and making a meal of him will bestow longevity. Time and time again Monkey exerts himself on the monk’d behalf, saving Tripitaka from hungry monsters who disguise themselves as damsels in distress or feeble patriarchs, when they don’t simply capture the travelers by a frontal assault."
520,0,"The story is magnificent adventure, incorporating poetry, allusions to esoteric medicine and meditation practices, breathtaking descriptions of travel, ferocious fight sequences, and braggadocio exchanges between combatants. It is so refreshing to encounter a classic that isn’t inherently a tragedy based on war or lust for power, thirst for revenge. Instead, this epic centers around a quest to benefit all of creation by promoting enlightenment. In the style of the poems included in this translation, here is a summary:"

539,0,This labor of love from Anthony Yu is an amazing translation for English readers!  In the preface Mr. Yu discusses his reasons for wanting to provide a culturally accurate translation for English readers.  Being a native speaker of Chinese and growing up in the culture as well as being a professor of Asian studies and history in an English speaking country is really what makes this translation so amazing.  The footnotes at the bottom of each page were an especially nice detail.
540,0,"Oftentimes with weighty classics like this all the footnotes are either at the end of the book with the appendices or at the end of the chapter.  This leads to a lot of fumbling around and flipping pages back and forth and can subsequently take you out of your reading experience.  It is also easier, at least for me, to forget some of the context of what I was reading doing all this flipping back and forth.  Not only do the footnotes themselves add immensely to the depth of understanding of the material but having them at the bottom of the page they are referencing makes reading easy and enjoyable.  Culture specific footnotes really helped me understand the intensity of the situations I was reading about as well as just how funny this book is."
541,0,As far as the story itself I think everyone should read it.  The story is hilarious and surprisingly modern in its storytelling despite the time it was written.  So many of the most famous animes in pop culture clearly have taken major inspiration from this story.  DBZ alone has ripped off so many elements you'll find yourself laughing at the similarities if you have ever watched DB or DBZ.
542,0,"Highly, HIGHLY recommend!!  Read now please!"
543,0,"GREAT book. I have never read the 1942 version but I imagine it must leave out a LOT. Considering Anthony C Yu's full unabridged version is 4 times the length of his here abridged version, this version is a great starting point. A must read for all interested in Chinese literature and a MUST for all Dragonball fans! You really get a sense of Goku and his world by reading this classic epic story."
544,0,Good translation and the abbreviated version maintains the spirit and I don't feel like I miss much by not purchasing each individual tome
545,0,"What a great book, I was sad when I got to the end that there was no more. Its amazing it was written hundreds of years ago and still has relevant moderns themes and insights. The mix of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism is special. Such an unusual story of myth, fairytale, proverb and religion, all with beautiful imagery and fun."
546,0,"I love 'Journey to the West' - the story is China's version of 'The Canterbury Tales', and the tales found within are both seminal works of Chinese literature and rewarding reads in and of themselves.  For this particular edition, Anthony Yu does a good job of translating into English: the prose text is very readable, and Yu's footnotes provide a lot of help on obscure references to Chinese superstitions and Buddhist heritage.  The translations of the poems are somewhat less satisfying, and I found myself frequently skipping over them to read just the prose storyline.  My main complaint is with the books Yu decides to include here: out of the 100 chapters of the full edition, Yu includes only the 31 chapters that are crucial to the plotline.  As a result, you get the barebones story, but some of the best-written and most comical subplots are left out.  All in all, though, a pretty good read, especially for anyone looking for the middle ground between the comic book versions and the full 4-volume 100-chapter text."
547,0,"Loved this version and sent it as a birthday gift to my son, who loved it as well. Great story to share with your kids. Recommend it all over the place."
548,0,Cool book. LOTS of typos. Is it hard to pay people to read these things before you publish them?
549,0,"I'm reading this weekly with my third grade students. I personally enjoy the story, but can't believe how much they're into it. I thought without pictures I'd be in for some trouble because this is my first time with a Kindle book on the projector. Yet, it works."
550,0,"Initially, I began reading the story with my booming stage voice to keep them interested, but I looked around and saw ten hands raised. I thought they were just going to bug me about getting water so they could get away so I ignored them for a bit. Then, one student blurted, ""Can I read?"" Well...sure. This continued until just about everyone in the room read a page."
551,0,"Now, I read first and the others read it after I've completed a few pages. They're really into it and learning some huge words at the same time. But I don't have to define too much so it works out."
552,0,My class loves this.
553,0,"On a more personal note, I had no clue how much Dragon Ball ripped from Sun Wukong. I was amazed and thrilled to read it. It keeps me entertained with or without the kids. I get a little upset when they ask me a question while we're reading it."
554,0,"Short read, of course, but a classic. Shepard's info at the back regarding his adaptation and the research that went into this version is interesting...perhaps as interesting as the tale itself. As he says, this is a condensation or just a part of the whole story (probably by 吴承恩), which is available to read, but this is certainly able to stand on its own. Great thing about these tales is that the hero doesn't always come out on top...or come out as a hero. There are lessons to learn, we just have to seek them out."
555,0,A great introductory book to the many fables of the Monkey King.
556,0,It is fun. It is exciting. It is everything a little boy with special needs wanted.
557,0,"Not having any inkling of the Monkey King, this boy was introduced to its fables by word. Stories were told to him through memories and it is such a great feeling for him to actually have a book where his own mother could read and read again the fables."
558,0,"This is a humorous retelling of a 16th century Chinese tale, or at least this is what we are told. Monkey is a kind of superman, but he doesn't seem all that bright. His parent was a magic stone, which being a stone could not talk and never gave him a name. He served as a king for some four hundred years but became bored and wanted a higher position. He went to learn with the Patriarch who taught him magic arts and made him immortal. Then he decided he wanted to be a god. His adventures are sometimes ridiculous but always funny and many readers will enjoy them."
559,0,"The universally known stories in a culture have a profound and lasting influence in the mindset of growing children they are told to, and mark the continuity of tradition when repeated to their own children. This is true in every culture and this story is the ultimate in Chinese children stories. Not only does this story contain numerous character studies, conflicts and scenes that have entered into linguistic/world view idiom, but hidden inside this story are cryptic allusions to deep Buddhist and Taoist training. The full version of this story has 100 books and some authors have considered this story on par with such classics as the Tao-Te-Ching."
560,0,"This version is a good introduction to this story, the sort to give you a taste or to read to a child. I have a dozen versions of this story and while this is not my choice as the best short-popular version, it is close. Further, this author has released this text for the Kindle for 1 penny! This is the world's greatest bargain. Absolutely everyone should load this on their reader..."
561,0,As an aside...
562,0,"I hope that many like myself will purchase his dead tree version of the book and put it on their shelf, prove to publishers and Amazon that this is a good economic model. May many more authors release inexpensive e-book versions of texts as a promotion of their work. There is presently a vast quantity of high quality free audio books by authors trying to break in or grow their base, for traditionally published material. I regularly purchase texts that I have listened to or heard for free on the NPR Radio Reader program."
563,0,"I personally have been less than enthused with the universal $10 price for kindle books, the overall reading experience and utility is not the equivalent of a paper book. Given that 99.9% of the infrastructure costs such a printing, ink, paper, transport and warehousing are nonexistent for e-books, $10 is exorbitant.  I generally feel that if the paper back version of a book is available for $15 compared to a $10 Kindle e-book, I would unhesitatingly go with paper."
564,0,"There is a lot of inexpensive e-book content ""notably - Author 50-years-dead stuff"" but much of the contemporary less than $5 content is barely spam. I hope that the Kindle consumer community will spot and recommend high quality inexpensive content; review and recommend it to others. Vote with your voice and and wallet (mouse-click) for this content to knock publishers of their high-horse..."
565,0,"As a westerner, I didn't grow up with Monkey and Journey to the West, only coming across it as an adult. It's a great story, though, and as fundamental  to Chinese culture as the Grimm fairy tales are to Euro-American culture. I got this short book to read to my grandchildren so they wouldn't have to wait as long as I did to encounter this entertaining rascal."
566,0,Classic entertainment.
567,0,"If I'm not mistaken, this is adapted from 16th century Chinese lore.  It's the preamble to Journey to the West - a super-bizarre, larger than life superhero story about a badass super-strength monkey (named Monkey - what up creativity?) with a several-ton staff that changes size at will."
568,0,Anyone who's played the PS3 / 360 game Enslaved - it's a weirdly-adapted version of this story... kind of.
569,0,"This - and Aaron Shepard's entire series of culturally diverse children's story adoptions, are well worth a read."
570,0,"It makes me want to read its source material, which I gather was its point. I've always been a bit of a mythology fan, and Asian mythology is a fascinating contrast to the Greek/Roman and Norse that I'm most familiar with. One star off for feeling somewhat incomplete, though I suppose that was part of the plan for getting me to read the original."
571,0,"Aaron Shepard does for folklore and epic poems what Charles and Mary Lamb did for Shakespeare in the 1800's--produces short, exciting, plot-centered adaptations that make the originals accessible to readers young and old, and that may tempt you to dip into the real thing someday."
572,0,"Design and editing is admirable, too."
573,0,A good retelling of the origin of Monkey and an introduction to Chinese mythology that encourages you to learn more.
574,0,"I'm a Chinese speaker, but my daughter isn't. She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story, so we ordered this book. The translation is slightly awkward, especially the inconsistent translation of names (some are translated by meaning, such as ""Piggy"" and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name, such as ""Xuan Zeng""). I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter. That being said, I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers, so I'm not sure if there are much better versions out there or not."
575,0,"Long ago I saw on TV a Chinese series on this story, without subtitles, so I was looking for an English version to read.  This gave me the basic story line, but is definately for beginning readers.  Has a shortened story line with a play version included and a vocabulary section for the meanings of the words.  Great for teaching purposes for 1st through 3rd graders."
576,0,"The quality of the book is very good, the content translation is very good, and the mailing is very smooth."
577,0,"I became interested in this book after watching Forbidden Kingdom. The story of the Monkey King is thoughtful and entertaining.  The Kindle edition was a no brainer at 99 cents.  The translation is fantastic and it reads like it was written with English being its original language.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Monkey King, and/or Asian history."
578,0,Journey to the West has truly stood the test of time. A fun read hundreds of years after it was written.
579,0,"This book and its sister book are excellent for people who are learning Chinese.  They tell the stories of the Monkey King, one of the most enduring characters in Chinese culture in an easy to understand manner.  They also provide good reference for the Chinese characters used in the stories and their English translations.  Well done!"
580,0,"I am incredibly happy with this purchase. It's action packed and a page turning read. You forget you're learning Mandarin. The story is safe for teenagers, is very well written, and has a ton of helpful material to go with it. I wish this was offered in a traditional character version. I would recommend this for highschool students or College students looking for an interesting way to sharpen their reading comprehension."
581,0,"Very helpful.  The pinyin, side by side with the characters, is most helpful to someone like me who is beginner/intermediate level and trying to learn Chinese characters. The pinyin is on the opposite page to the characters which makes it easy to reference while not making it so easy that I end up reverting back to just reading pinyin."
582,0,"I really like this story. It is really good. It has the story in pinyin, character and in English. It also have vocabulary words. I will for sure buy more of the author’s book."
583,0,"Content is suitable for children to read, printing is very beautiful."
584,0,"I'm the author of this book.  If you're reading this review, then I'm happy to report that Amazon allows authors to review their own books!"
585,0,"""Trouble in Heaven"" is the second in a series of books based on the Chinese classic story Journey to the West.  (the first is ""Rise of the Monkey King"".)  My collaborator Xiao Hui Wang and I have developed this series of books for people who are learning to read Chinese, but unlike some other easy-to-read books in this genre, we have tried to focus on writing good quality fiction that will appeal to readers of all ages."
586,0,"Each page of Chinese is paired with a facing page of pinyin.  Every word that's not in the standard 600-word HSK 3 vocabulary is defined in a footnote at the bottom of the page where it first appears.  Proper names are all underlined.  And there's a complete English version and glossary in the back.  Our website also has a complete audio recording of the book, as well as study questions for classroom use."
587,0,We hope you'll enjoy the books!
588,0,"This is a great series of graded readers, would be 5 stars, but each volume is a little too short."
589,0,"Content is suitable for children to read, printing is very beautiful."
590,0,Great for adult learner -- engagingly but accessibly written for advanced beginner/intermediate reader.
591,0,"I'm the author of this book.  We just published the book today, so here's the first review!"
592,0,"This book is the third in our series based on the Chinese classic novel ""Journey to the West"".  The first book is ""Rise of the Monkey King"" and the second is ""Trouble in Heaven"".  All are available on Amazon.com."
593,0,"These three books focus on Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and they form a trilogy of sorts, telling the story of his birth and his adventures prior to meeting the monk Xuangzang and beginning the epic journey to India that takes up most of the ""Journey to the West"".  Personally this book is my favorite, because of the interesting plot twists, Sun Wukong's outrageous actions, and what happens to him in the end when he... well, I won't give away the ending!"
594,0,"All books have the same format -- each page of Chinese characters is paired with a facing page in pinyin.  Proper names are underlined, and each words not in the HSK 3 vocabulary is highlighted and defined in a footnote at the bottom of the page.  There's a complete English translation and a glossary in the back of the book, and a free audiobook is available on YouTube and on our website.  I am an American learning to read and understand Chinese, and I developed this format because I think it's the best way to learn as you read."
595,0,"Along with my collaborator Xiao Hui Wang, we hope you'll enjoy the story, and if the book helps you to improve your Chinese, so much the better!"
596,0,"If you’re familiar with any Chinese folklore, it’s probably this story. But you probably know it as “Journey to the West.”  It’s not only been released in numerous editions as a novel, it’s also been adapted for film, stage play, and I’m sure there must be a video game of it out there."
597,0,"If you’re thinking, “Chinese folklore? Sounds boring.” Think again. This is a superhero story. Monkey, also known as the Monkey-King and “Great Sage Equal to Heaven,” is an immortal who has all manner of supernatural powers. He can fly. He can make copies of himself. He can transform himself—either disguising himself as another being or appearing as an inanimate object. He has an iron truncheon that can be the size of a sewing needle or a mile long and which is indestructible. Wielding said staff, he can defeat armies or deities."
598,0,"In fact, the flaw in this story isn’t a lack of adventure or thrill. On the contrary, it’s one adventure after the next. If anything, the flaw is “Superman Syndrome.” That’s what I call it when the hero is so ridiculously overpowered that even when he’s fighting gods, dragons, or whole armies there’s still no doubt about the outcome."
599,0,"Of course, the Monkey does eventually meet his match in the form of the Buddha. The Buddha defeats Monkey not in combat, but in a bet.  That event shifts the direction of the story. In the early chapters, Monkey is goes about heaven and earth arrogantly wreaking havoc. He’s not altogether detestable. He does have his redeeming traits, but he’s insufferably arrogant and mischievous. After he’s imprisoned following his run-in with the Buddha, a monk is assigned to go to India to bring back scriptures (hence, a “journey to the west”) to China. Monkey is assigned to be the monk’s guardian and along with two others that they pick up along the way (Pigsy and Sandy) the monk is escorted on his journey. The party faces one challenge after the next, and the trip is long and arduous. Some of the challenges require brute force but in many cases they are battles of wits. So while Monkey may be overpowered, he does experience personal growth over the course of the story."
600,0,"The story is told over 30 chapters, each set up with a cliffhanger. I enjoyed this translation by Arthur Waley. It is end-noted, which is useful given the historic and cultural nuances that may not be clear to readers."
601,0,"It should be noted that this is unambiguously a Buddhist tale. There is a bias against Taoists and other non-Buddhist religions evident throughout the story. It’s not just the fact that the Buddha easily defeats Monkey when no other deity or group of deities can, there’s a steady stream of anti-Taoist sentiment. So, Taoists and Chinese Folk Religion practitioners be warned, I guess."
602,0,"I would recommend this book for fiction readers, particularly if you have an interest in the superhero genre or Chinese literature."
603,0,"This version of Journey to the West exudes a perfumed wind. Waley is the greatest of translators from Chinese.  While this is abridged and cannot match the magisterial but stiffer version of Anthony Yu, it is just right for an introduction to this fabulous work. Many who read this will want to tackle Yu. Many others would not wish it longer than it is. Waley occupies a happy position at the boundary between these two groups."
604,0,"Wonderfully funny and sometimes poignant ancient classic novel about pilgrimage by the wild and resourceful Monkey King and the diffident Tripitaka, Monkey's nominal master."
605,0,Here's one of my favorite quotes from the novel.
606,0,"""They travelled on for many days and autumn had already come when late one evening Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, 'Disciple, where are we going to halt to-night?'  'Master,' said Monkey, 'that is a question for ordinary men to ask, not for such pilgrims as we.' 'Wherein lies the difference?' asked Tripitaka.  'Ordinary people at this hour,' said Monkey, 'are hugging their children or cuddling their wives in soft beds under warm coverlets, lying snug and comfortable as you please.  But how can we pilgrims expect any such thing?  By moonlight or starlight on we must go, supping on the air and braving the wet, so long as the road lasts.’"""
607,0,"Its journey to the west but in a more compact read.  The monk travels westward to spread buddhism but has quite a journey.  The read journey to the west is too long for undergraduate students.  So I can assign this to them since is only about 300 pages.  The full length translation by the same person is 4 volumes and about 1200 pages.  I recommend the full length version if you are reading for your personal enrichment of reading a Chinese classic.  If you just want a quick read to understand the legend better than any movie, TV show, or children's book, then this is a fine abridged version of the translation I enjoy most and bought the last time I was in China.  To be honest, none of the popular culture shows or childrens' books I have seen here, or in China, are anywhere close to the actual book.  They just borrow some of the characters and call it Monkey King.  This is the real deal and, thus, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! One of my favorites ever!"
608,0,Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult. I was so happy to see this reprint in paperback.
609,0,"The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism as well as satirizes Chinese society of the 16th century. Monkey is, as to be expected, hilarious. There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet, so I'll not waste your time writing what others have already written.  Just know you'll enjoy!"
610,0,"The pre-chosen descriptions of the plot mood, characters and pace that Amazon provides are no match for the wonder of the book. Monkey has entertained children and elders in China for 1000 years. There are movies, songs, and spin-off tales. Donnie Yen just did a new movie in 2014 based on this book,and in 2013 Journey to the West was released in theaters. That's the mark of a book with staying power!  It's a fun read with twists and turns and magic and all the splendor and wonder you expect from China 1000 years ago. Think of the most sensational and unreal Kung-Fu movie you ever saw with flying swords and beasts and rooftop fights, magic fists, Crouching Tigers and Dragons and mystery. That is this book in it's ancient glory. You may love this, or you may find your child enthralled with the characters, plot and wonder of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, or the Jade Princess, or the demon catcher..."
611,0,"""Monkey"" is the story of the Monkey-king, acting as a guarding of a Buddhist monk in his travels to the west. Don't let this description mislead you. It is not a lofty, religious book. It IS an action-packed adventure thriller, with some touches of philosophy and fantasy."
612,0,"What I liked most about this book it is that it does not obey the norms (or guidelines) of western literature. The heroes can be cowards, betrayal is completely expected, good and evil are not opposites. Very refreshing, and keeps you on your (mental) toes."
613,0,Highly recommended!
614,0,Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult. To find this old edition in such good quality and at such a reasonable price was a boon.  The seller was prompt and the book came securely packaged.
615,0,"The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism as well as satirizes Chinese society of the 16th century. Monkey is, as to be expected, hilarious. There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet, so I'll not waste your time writing what others have already written.  Just know you'll enjoy!"
616,0,"Mama used to read ""between bites"" at the dinner table to keep seven kids quiet and interested, and let Dad enjoy his dinner. She looked for books that had a beautiful flow to the language that would attract even the baby, simple enough basic story lines that the little kids would enjoy it, enough adventure to attract the middle kids, and deeper, subtler meanings to engage the older kids and adults. This one, Monkey, by Wu Ch'eng-en, translated by Arthur Whaley, was top contender, and I heard it read aloud many times in my childhood, always with enjoyment, always learning more. (The other most-repeated books were Kipling's Kim and Tolkein's The Hobbit.)"
617,0,"  It is the story of the irreverent magic Monkey King who had adventures on earth, tricked a sage into teaching him the secrets of magic and immortality, and then created havoc on earth and in the beaurocracy of heaven. (Mama explained that the idea of beaurocracy is deeply ingrained, and that people tend to imagine their afterlife to be ideal versions of what this one might be.) As punishment Monkey was imprisoned for 500 years under the Mountain of the Five Elements, and as penance was to accompany and protect the priest Tripitaka on a journey from China to India to bring back copies of sacred scrolls, to bring the true teachings of the Buddha to China."
618,0,"They had adventures. And the author pulls us from one to the next with hints. ”If you do not know how far they still had to travel and whether disasters still awaited them, you must listen to what is told in the next chapter.”"
619,0,"Some people know the character Son Goku, from the Japanese cartoon series Dragon Ball Z.  Others are familiar with Pokemon's Infernape.  And still more know a similar character from a TV miniseries shown in the US in 2001 called The Lost Empire.  Rumor has it that Jet Li will collaborate with Jackie Chan to portray a Sun Wukong-like character in the forthcoming movie The Forbidden Kingdom.  What fans of these characters may not know, is that they are all based on China's infamous Sun Wukong--or The Monkey King."
620,0,"The tale of the Sun Wukong is one of the four major Chinese literary classics.  His 81-chapter story, called Journey to the West (Xi You Ji), was written by Wu Chen-En  in the 1500s.  Monkey's legend is based on the true story of a well-known monk, Xuan Zang (602-664), who traveled to Inida to bring the Sutra--the Buddhist holy book--to China to enlighten the people and improve their lives.  In Journey to the West, however, reality gives way to a much more entertaining and fantastic version of the story."
621,0,"Journey to the West is a hero's quest, elaborated with Monkey's supernatural powers, interlaced with Taoist and Buddhist practices and beliefs as well as common superstitions, embellished with fairy tales, monster stories, legends, and fables.  Some of the chapters read like superhero comics, others like instructional Bible stories.  Some parts of the story, as when Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy are hiding in a Temple and outwit the priests, are downright hilarious.  The Sun Wukong legend can be read as a hero-journey-quest, a political and social satire of rebellion against a corrupt government, or as pure fancy.  No wonder Journey to the West has endured for so long."
622,0,"It's hard to believe that as popular as Journey to the West has remained over the centuries, its author would never have admitted to writing it.  Wu Chen-En was a scholar and a statesman.  During the 1500s (Ming Dynasty), it was considered unfit for educated and high ranking men to read any kind of comic or popular literature.  Wu was influenced in writing this tale by the super-hero stories he read secretly while in school."
623,0,"The entertaining escapades of Sun Wukong have remained popular through the ages, inspiring operas, cartoons, and now movies.  The tale has even spawned a Sun Wukong festival, which features recreations of many of his adventures, and a statue of Monkey stands at a Buddhist temple in Sau Mau Ping in Hong Kong.  Chairman Mao was also a fan, who mentioned Monkey as a role model in many of his speeches.  He said people should emulate Monkey's fearlessness in thinking, doing work, striving for his objectives, and extricating China from poverty.  Sun Wukong is well-known and well-liked in modern times among children in Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and Korea.  I think Wu Chen-En would secretly be very pleased!"
624,0,"If you loved Kung Fu Hustle, and enjoyed Shaolin Soccer, you will love this. It's what I call a ""sneaky romantic comedy"" - none of the ham-fisted, heartstring pulling that Hollywood is so fond of, but touching and heartfelt all the same. Plus, the action sequences, CGI, and ass-kickery are top-notch. You won't be disappointed."
625,0,"Stephen Chow does it again!  A unique masterpiece from Hong Kong.  I don't know where he gets his ideas, but he had me mesmerized for the entire film.  I felt the same about his previous classics ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"".  The humor is side-splitting.  Everything is so tongue-in-cheek but what has enhanced all of his films are the special effects.  Amazing characters, sound effects and soundtrack.  I never give you guys spoilers or plots.  Just watch this and judge for yourself.  The box cover is all I share!  ALL 5 STARS!  Chow is a Champion of film."
626,0,I admit i've been a Stephen Chow Fan for a long time and it definitely helps to know some of the comedic style and cultural references to the famous Journey to the West mythology that has been retold and remade so many times. And there are so many refreshing angles that Chow took that were pleasantly unexpected. I hesitated to invest time and money on one of Chow's not starring films!? Get out of here! Can't be good right? Wrong. His presence is so strongly felt even without his screen presence. The story just breezed by without any lulls and I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. For the non Chow initiated film collector looking for a audio visual feast you won't be disappointed with top notch graphics and action. The genius of his story telling and comedy is understandable to a wide audience. Example. His first scene there is an intense water battle which becomes a see saw balancing act (a visual reference we can all appreciate from our childhood) I can't wait to show this one to others. And maybe watch it in English next time. I watched in the original language with subs and I don't speak the dialect.
627,0,As a martial arts movie fan my expectations are set reasonably low. I want characters without too much depth and an easy to follow plot. This movie delivers! The abilities and powers of the fighters are delightful and the motivations perfectly one dimensional. Great for a lighthearted evening of popcorn and goofy laughs.
628,0,"While not the best of his films (like Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer) this is still a great film. Anyone a fan of his other stuff should give this one a shot. For those wondering, yes this does have an English Dub track. I watched this on Netflix and all they had was English Sub. So I was hesitant buying the blu-ray because some people said it had it, while others said it did not."
629,0,"If you're looking for the perfect movie to spend about 2 hours watching with the love of your life eating popcorn and sour patch kids.  This is the movie for you.  Make a memory, share a laugh, get excited, be afraid.  All that is possible with this movie.  Just know that once that two hours is gone you're going to ask yourself two important questions.  1) What the hell did I just watch?  2) Is there more where that came from, because I need there to be more."
630,0,The answers to those questions are. 1) Does it really matter?  That was freaking awesome wasn't it? 2) Yes.  Try Kung Fu Hustle if you haven't already.
631,0,"All the credit goes to his co stars Wen Zhang and Huang Bo. Who steal the show instanstly. From Stephen Chow, (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), brings his lastest and most crazy movie yet, Journey To The West. The story of Xuan Zang, taking his disciples on the journey to the west. But before the that comes just a simple demon hunter (Xuan Zang) trying to slay demons with nursery rhymes bringing out their inner goodness. More actors include Shu Qi as Miss Duan, Show Luo as Prince, Xing Yu as Fist of the North Star. And the brightest and biggest Zhang Chao Li as Almighty Foot. Stephen Chow has proved to become a huge success with his films and proved to be even crazier with his ideas making Journey to the west his most Outrageous movie yet."
632,0,"This is a well filmed movie based upon folklore. The writing and acting were over the top.  The action and Cinema Graphics blend so well and look as if your watching a reality show.  The movie is subtitled in English for the non Chinese speaking audience. A classic to be placed next to the Blind Swordsman.  This is really a funny, non stop action movie mixed with monstrous demons and hard kicking antiheroes. ."
633,0,"Anything Stephen Chow has a hand in is great.  I personally love Chinese fantasy movies and this one is truly an adventure in China's mythical past.  Reading Sub Titles does not take away from this movie or listen to it in English Dubbed, which is done very well on this film.  Take it from me go out and find other movies that Stephen Chow was involved in.  When he is a character in his or anyone's films it just rocks. If I had one super wish in life its would be to meet Stephen Chow, he has given me a great happiness in the roles he has portrayed, I wish he could make dozens of more movies before he decides to retire.  You can't beat him or Jackie Chan."
634,0,"This was very creative.. and very funny.. and I loved the actors, the direction, the dialogue.. the effects.. the jokes within jokes about any and all movies of this type. I wish the subtitles were EASIER.. I think they must test these on 20 year olds.. but that's often the case with subtitles so... not really bad."
635,0,I seriously recommend this movie. Anyone say 13 or over..although it's not sexy or dirty except in very mild ways.. in fact.. a couple of the scenes of romance are soooo funny I might even say go to age 11.
636,0,Really great flik!
637,0,"This book is a classic, and doesn't really need much explanation. With that said, there was a particular choice made in translation that I found immensely irritating - U.S. Standard units were used, and just substituted in for Chinese units. Li became miles, span became foot, so on and so forth. The other Chinese Classics don't do this, and it was disappointing to see here. There were also some odd translations within the descriptions, such as describing instances where monsters were pounded into pulp as ""like hamburger"". These are minor flaws, but they still grate."
638,0,"My daughter was thrilled with book collection and has been avidly reading it since we got it for her at the start of the summer break. I haven't read it myself, but I will relate that it speaks to her 13-year old sensibilities and she has been enjoying them. Perhaps at some point I will have the time to read the set and see what the fuss is about."
639,0,~ Kort
640,0,"I bought this some time ago and finally got around to reading it.  The language is great if flowery, but part way through I discovered several blank pages.  The one sent to me is the 11th printing of 2011.  I bought it over a year ago so don't think there's any return policy.  If anyone buys this, check it upon receipt for blank pages.  Mine start at page 314 of volume one.  I can follow the story across the blank pages, but it is annoying.  But other than that I love the language used in this translation."
641,0,"First of all, this is one of the four greatest classics of China, which already merits your attention."
642,0,"To be more specific - this is an epic full of the most diverse adventures, in the style of the glorious Ancient-Greek  Iliad, Odyssey and the Tasks of Hercules."
643,0,"However, strangely enough, this can also be a written description of a computer game, full of battles against ferocious dragons, monsters and corrupted leaders - religious or civil - passing from level to level, till the happy end. The heroes also carry all kinds of special weapons and possess supernatural powers - belonging to a culture that has probably inspired also those very computer games."
644,0,"These heroes' purpose is double - fighting against evil creatures, and refining their own selves in order to reach heavenly immortality. They are three,- symbolizing the three parts of each body. The witty Monkey represents the intelligent resourceful brain. The pious monk Sanzang is the compassionate heart, and Pig - the village-fool - is the greedy stomach, providing the many humorous episodes. In short - never a dull moment. By the way, the Monkey also becomes a monk, and the unintentional pun Monkey-monk provides us with hilarious instants..."
645,0,"The first chapters describe how Monkey was born from the primordial union between Heaven and Earth from a stone-egg, and how he defied the heavenly rulers, wrecking havoc in their lofty palaces, ruining their peach-feast, stealing the pills of immortality, winning by ruse a wondrous weapon, subduing ferocious dragons as well as many troops of heavenly soldiers, being cooked in a furnace just to win all-seeing golden pupils, erasing his name from the records of the underworld, thus making himself immortal - and more such brave and indeed incredible feats - only to be subdued, finally, by the great Buddha himself. His only way to release himself from his eternal imprisonment is - to help the pious monk Sanzang, whose life-story is most touching, make the 36,000-miles-journey to the west to fetch the scriptures for the impious easterners. On the way they're surprised by seemingly impossible tasks, such as crossing huge seas or lofty ridges, and in addition they meet all kinds of unimaginable powerful fiends, which they must fight according to the different circumstances. Each battle is described in a short free poem, just as the breathtaking views of the mountains, brooks, rivers, storms, flowers and birds are described lyrically."
646,0,"Each of the many adventures - about 60, at least - is self-contained, and so, even if the reading stretches over several months - nothing's lost."
647,0,"The reading is easy and pleasant, and mostly - encouraging - since each battle symbolizes our own daily hardships, and so each victory is ours too!!.."
648,0,"Since the book concentrates mostly on the versatile ever-lasting fight between Good and Evil, with very little romance, for example, it could be read by any child, just like fairy-stories. And so, whoever is looking for a present for a youngster, even 10 years old, or whoever is willing to teach a computer-addicted boy or a teenager to dedicate some time to simple reading - this is the book for the task!!"
649,0,"Plus, whoever is willing to enjoy a long journey from China to India, with everything it has to offer - sceneries, people, trades, spirituality, vices, different habits of many countries - at least twelve are mentioned - and also visit many levels of heaven and even the underworld on the way - and get out of it intact - all this without leaving the comfortable home and even bed - especially during long cold nights - just step out and invest in buying this book - it's simply indispensable!!!"
650,0," A personal confession - I happened to be born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese astrology, and on the day of the Monkey according to the Mexican astrology - so I'm a double Monkey, and I'd detested it!!! Till I've completed the reading of this book. Now I can be proud of myself, just for having such a representative in one of the most fascinating specimens of the world literature - the most charming Monkey you'll ever meet!!! :-)"
651,0,"This is a four volume translation of the great Chinese epic. It is published by the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing. I suspect this a government organization. I do not read Chinese, so I cannot say anything about the translation. But I like this version. It is poetic and appears to be complete--it is over 2500 pages long. This is a pure translation, each of the four volumes has about three notes at the end. There are other translations that explain everything. Those explanations are not essential to enjoying the story. I recommend this version if you just want to read a great story."
652,0,"I am so happy I bought this edition of the series! It arrived on time in great condition. I have been wanting to read this book and am very happy with this particular translation. It is written is a poetic yet easily understandable way. The 4 books are bound in a nice cover. A couple previous customers commented about the thinness of the paper. For me this was a good thing. I was concerned that 4 600-page books were not going to fit on the shelf, but due to how thin the books are made I do not have this problem! This is a delightful read and a great edition! Highly recommended."
653,0,5 stars for the translation.  4 stars for the physical book quality.
654,0,"Since other people have expounded on the plot, here is a review based on the physical book. The actual paperback novels are approximately 7"" x 4.25,"" so easy to hold in your hand and tuck into a briefcase.  The pages are a bit thin, not ""Bible"" thin, but they are a bit thinner than most paperback books.  One of my volumes didn't hold up well to sitting in a steam-filled bathroom."
655,0,"There are occasional pictures and sparse endnotes, but they do not detract from the story at all.  The pictures were drawn during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and are done in the old chinese style, not some new-fangled doodles."
656,0,"Some of the translation is a bit iffy, and sentences do not necessarily always make sense, but you'll understand it contextually.  Some of the wording is extremely quaint, such as Pig complaining that the demons failed to drink ""acuppa"" with them.  There is much more painfully British vernacular, but it just adds to the goofy charm of this book.  Don't bother wringing your hands over the never-ending list of characters.  Skim over them and read on.  After all, there are an awful lot of demons and gods to meet on the journey, and quite a few of them are fated to die via Monkey's cudgel, making their characters irrelevant in the long-run.  One thing I noticed is that there is an awful lot of scatological farce for a book written in the Ming dynasty (don't worry, it's still hilarious)."
657,0,"I've read a couple translations of Monkey King, and while they'll all stay in my personal library, this is the one I anticipate picking up again and again.  I loved this book as a child and ten years later, I still do.  A must-read for fans of mythology or Chinese literature in general."
658,0,"This is an excellent translation of the entire JTTW.  Sure, the paper is paper-thin and cheap, but if you hold it up to the light you can read both sides at once, saving time.  Stop whining- for short money you are getting almost 2400 pages of the finest mythology, religion, spirituality, allegory, folktale, humor, and monkey butt-kicking awesomeness.  My favorite book in the world, bar none (and I can only read it in translation, alas!).  It might not be for everyone, but I've already read this book twice and it was sublime."
659,0,"This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found. It is the third version of the story I've read, and unlike those other versions (""Adventures of Monkey King""/ISBN 0962076511 and ""Monkey : A Journey to the West [ABRIDGED]""/ISBN 1570625816), it contains the complete and unabridged story, preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story."
660,0,"This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness. It's a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work, and you get to hear all the interesting little back-stories and side-stories that make Journey to the West one of the great works of Chinese literaure. It's a weakness because these stories often seem completely irrelevant, and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion."
661,0,"For example, every time something happens in Heaven, Hell or in the palace of the Tang Emperor, the book includes a complete list of everyone who attended. In Heaven, at least, many of the names are descriptive (names of stars, constellations, etc.) and are therefore translated. In the Tang Emperor's palace, though, you'll get a list of 10 or 20 names in Chinese, and only some of the names ever get stories attached to them in the book (and I challenge any non-Chinese speaker to remember the names when they do show up again)."
662,0,"There's also a lot of poetry, and though the translations are good, translated poetry can never equal the original. In one sequence, a fisherman and a woodsman argue in verse for 10 or more pages of very small type, frequently singing songs set to tunes few non-Chinese would recognize by name. These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict, so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry. It's good poetry, to be sure, but it really can drag a bit."
663,0,"You can't just automatically skip over all the poems, as you might do with Tolkien, either. Elements of the story are often told in verse. You can usually skim if you're not interested in a particular bit of verse, but don't skip it entirely."
664,0,"The structure of the work is also surprisingly complex at times, especially given its age. It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character, and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later. You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story, but there's almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line."
665,0,"Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise. If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them, you'll get a second, (fortunately much abridged) version of an earlier portion of the story, written as dialog, this time. You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction, or probably just about any other country's older fiction, so this is not really a strong criticism given the work's great age, but I often found myself wishing the author (or the translator) had just written, ""he told them what had happened"" and left it at that."
666,0,"There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me. The word ""memorial"" was used throughout instead of ""memorandum"". It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on. I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout, but still didn't figure it out until I was several chapters into this one."
667,0,"Will all these complaints, you're probably wondering why I gave the book 4 stars. The fact is, for all its faults and quirks, ""Journey to the West"" is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched. The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment, while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action. It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China."
668,0,"If you want to get the whole story and can't read Chinese, this edition is your absolute best bet. (Indeed, it's pretty much your only bet.) Some of the other translations may be a faster read, but none are as satisfying."
669,0,"I bought the paperback edition several years ago. I loved the myths and read the material several times. Unfortunately, the paperbacks are poorly printed and not bound well enough for multiple readings. I just received the hardbacks and make the following observations: 1) left-hand pages are printed in Chinese while right-hand pages are printed in English, 2) pictures are on single pages with the facing pages blank, 3) binding seems to be very well done - strong as well as supple, and 4) there is a bookmark ribbon attached to the binding side of each volume. In summary, this looks like a quality edition. The hardback is printed in 6 volumes while the paperback (English only) is done in 3. I assume that the translation in the hardback is the same as in the paperback version. That was done very well and I'm looking froward to rereading the adventure with quality paper in my hands; that's one of the real luxuries in life!"
670,0,"I have, above, made several assumptions based on my prior experience with the paperback. If these assumptions prove wrong, I will update this review and my rating."
671,0,"This is in addition to my original review: I am now reading Volume 4 of 6. There is a horrible error in that volume. There are many missing pages from Volume 4; in their place are many pages from Volume 2. I am knocking two stars off the rating because of this. The vendor said he will send me a proper Volume 4 in October when his stock is replenished. I, fortunately, can finish reading the story because I have the paperback version from the same translator. If I receive a valid copy of Volume 4, I will re-rate upwards and assume there was just a bad run."
672,0,"I also note at this time that there are many little typos: wrong one of to, two, too; many one-letter substitutions; etc. I am of the opinion that the final edit of a translation should always be made by a native speaker of the ""to"" language. I'm guessing that this opinion was not respected here. The errors in the paperback version, if memory serves me correctly are different."
673,0,"This is a second update to my review: I have just received a corrected copy of Vol. 4 from the seller. Thus, I assume that good copies of this book set are available. I would caution you to check with your seller of choice that the hard copy set you order is one that does not contain the mistakes that were in my original order. At this point I'm changing my product rating back to 5 stars."
674,0,"I'm a Chinese speaker, but my daughter isn't. She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story, so we ordered this book. The translation is slightly awkward, especially the inconsistent translation of names (some are translated by meaning, such as ""Piggy"" and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name, such as ""Xuan Zeng""). I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter. That being said, I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers, so I'm not sure if there are much better versions out there or not."
675,0,"Long ago I saw on TV a Chinese series on this story, without subtitles, so I was looking for an English version to read.  This gave me the basic story line, but is definately for beginning readers.  Has a shortened story line with a play version included and a vocabulary section for the meanings of the words.  Great for teaching purposes for 1st through 3rd graders."
676,0,"The quality of the book is very good, the content translation is very good, and the mailing is very smooth."
677,0,"I became interested in this book after watching Forbidden Kingdom. The story of the Monkey King is thoughtful and entertaining.  The Kindle edition was a no brainer at 99 cents.  The translation is fantastic and it reads like it was written with English being its original language.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Monkey King, and/or Asian history."
678,0,Journey to the West has truly stood the test of time. A fun read hundreds of years after it was written.
679,0,"A worthy follow-up to Steven Chow's 2013 film, this one sticks closer to the Monkey King story and lacks it's predecessor's downbeat ending.  Monk Tang is again the main character in this film, but there's plenty of Sun Wukong action as well.  I was initially thrown off by the re-casting of the roles, but the actors do a great job.  At least the gorgeous She Qi re-prised her role from the first film, if only for a brief cameo.  The combination of writer/producer Steven Chow and writer/director Tsui Hark serves the film well.  There is a lot of imagination and color on the screen at all time, and the film kept my attention at al times.  And they even managed to sneak in the episode with the spider demons, which was the basis for the old Shaw Brothers' Monkey King film ""The Cave of Silken Web!""  Plus, there were plenty of times when I broke out in belly laughs, which I've come to expect from any of Steven Chow's films.  I definitely enjoyed this film more than ""The Monkey King 2"" with Aaron Kwok, which was released around the same time.  I have to state, though, that if you do not have at least a slight familiarity with the Monkey King story you will probably be lost watching this film."
680,0,"Even as a Chinese viewer, the sequel is never as well made as the initial movie.  Being the second film in the series, the casting changes since the first movie were already irksome, add onto it, the even sillier screenplay (which is saying a lot when contrasted with the silliness preset by the first movie)."
681,0,Is it a bad movie?  No.
682,0,Does it require the suspension of disbelief as common to a Stephen Chow comedy?  Yes.
683,0,Should you be familiar with the tale of Journey to the West?  Most definitely.
684,0,Otherwise it'll just feel like a special effect filled B-movie :(
685,0,"Humor, elaborate CGI action scenes, and colorful cast of demons, the 2nd movie in the chow journey to the west series is in many ways what you would expect if you enjoyed the first one.  But while I did enjoy it, I would say its not quite as good as its predecessor.  This is mostly due to scripting, where what proceeds doesn't correlate with what happens next.  There's not much acting in the deception and without spoiling the whole first scene of the movie doesn't make sense in the context of the ending.  Also the first one felt like a movie, and fantastic as the action sequences were, this outing feels more like a filler tv episode than a major arc (plot wise).  I will say I have not read any of journey to the west so it is quite possible this is loyal to the original work so my review will only take the movie as the uncultured american watching it.  Despite my nitpicks everything else that I liked about the first one is in here and with it the move is still quite enjoyable.  The actors really nail the visual comedy providing performances that compliment the colorful and crazy world in which the story takes place.  The Demons have different forms and the movie seems to spare no labor in transitioning them from one to the other as it sees fit.  In the end what few flaws it has are eclipsed by the comedy and the set pieces which make the movie a fun journey indeed."
686,0,It’s not really a sequel to Steven Chow’s movie in anything but name and a superficial borrowing from the first “Journey to the West” with some  flashbacks from the first flick.
687,0,"The story, look, makeup, dialogue and characters don’t match the first one and the CG, soundtrack and cinematography don’t either."
688,0,It’s an ok movie but it’s not directed by Steven Chow and doesn’t have the same level of humor and cleverness to it.
689,0,It’s more like a B rate cash-in that Disney does with it’s straight to video sequels.
690,0,"If you get it, get it with that in mind. It’s not completely terrible but it’s not anywhere near the same league as “Kung Fu Hustle” or its predecessor."
691,0,"Horrible sequel. Acting style is different from the original and not even the same characters but alot of flashbacks to the original movie which made it more obvious. Comedy in original was organic and flowed well... this release the comedy was contrived and forced out of context ""just to be funny"". I loved the original but I had to stop this one after 30 mins and throw it in the trash. Don't make the same mistake I did..."
692,0,So much fun.  SUN WU KONG RULES!
693,0,Very good scj-fi
694,0,"Just received the disk yesterday and planning to watch the whole movie with my husband this weekend.  One important and really happy discovery is that this movie has English language audio option, not just merely providing the English subtitle."
695,0,"In Disk main menu, Click the language menu.  There are audio and subtitle submenu.  In Audio submenu, you can choose to listen to this movie in English, Chinese or Thai.  In subtitle submenu, there are more language options available."
696,0,I really hope that Amazon will provide a list of the foreign films which offer English audio option when the customers doing a movie search.  Also very helpful is to provide this info in the description of the product.
697,0,"Not bad, good story and not too long."
698,0,"Saw the movie at the theater and I loved it. Lots of fun, humor and, literally, fantastic, epic action. Looks like different actors for the same characters, except for flashbacks of Shu Qi. Usually, that bugs me but since I saw this movie first..."
699,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
700,0,"This is part three of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  If you've gotten this far you've undoubtedly found it hard to put down. This volume includes the episode of the fake Monkey King; it is a very gripping tale highly relatable to these modern times, where indeed the unreal makes as much if not more sense than the real. The CCTV Beijing production did a great job putting this and other tales from this volume on the screen."
701,0,It's not what you'd imagine from a journey novel. Challenges are overcome less so with violence and more with good ol' trolling. Fun to read!
702,0,"This is the third volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" The story continues to be fantastical, violent, and, despite its episodic nature, surprisingly compelling to me. I was reading the previous volume in parallel with Ken Liu's ""The Wall of Storms."" Once I started this third volume, I decided to shelve Ken Liu's book in favor of Tripitaka and Pilgrim's continuing adventures. For a Chinese classic published over four hundred years ago, the content is far less elevated and far more entertaining than I'd expected. Consider, for instance, this edifying quote, ""Even a fart is additional air!"" I am now impatiently waiting for Amazon to deliver the final volume."
703,0,"This is a wonderful translation of one of the Chinese classics. Don't be intimidated by the length, I never tired of the antics of the original Gang of 4. I felt like I had to pick this series up after seeing so many TV sets in Viet Nam with monkey and pig guys flying around on them, and I'm glad I did."
704,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."
705,0,A Must Read Book for Avid Readers Around the World!  Great story full of adventure that I wish I was a part of.
706,0,"This is a great story not just this volume, I really recommend these books to be read by anyone it has everything that a great -great story need."
707,0,Prepare yourself for a great journey...read the story.
708,0,"Of course, this is Chinese culture. If you know Sun Wu Kong you know Chinese people. This edition is scholarly and brings the Jenner edition up to date."
709,0,great novel.
710,0,My chinese husband says these books are great and tell the traditional story of the monkey king. The books divide the mo meh kings journey into short easy to read portions for kids. Order came quickly and no delays.
711,0,Pro:
712,0,1. The annotations are excellent (though I wish there are a lot more).  The annotations greatly enhance understanding and enjoyment of this classic.
713,0,2. Good solid hardback book.
714,0,"3. In simplified Chinese.  If you want an edition in traditional Chinese, this is not the book to get."
715,0,Con:
716,0,1. The words are a little small and may be difficult to read for older readers.
717,0,"2. The Chinese title of the book, 西游记(插图注释版足本典藏), is misleading.  There is only 1 (one) illustration (插图) inside the whole book!"
718,0,"  If you are looking for an illustrated edition, this is not the book to get."
719,0,"3. If you look carefully at the book cover, you will see that the book is suppose to have Mandarin Phonetic Symbols (注音), which helps the reader pronounce the Chinese words.  I found no phonetic symbols in the book."
720,0,"These stories were well written and provide an insight into a religion unknown to many.  There were adventures and trials, sorrow and repentance, and a task accomplished.  Reading these stories helps all understand the benefits of a life worth living in a honest and righteous way. Many can benefit from a righteous life!"
721,0,"Awesome story! An irrepressible monkey character, seeking immortality and defying the very mandate of heaven, defying the gods themselves! A legend of freedom and bravery for the ages!"
722,0,Well written. Well translated. This book is a must! The monkey kings stories show you some insight on everyday battles that we all face. Maybe not in the form of a monkey or demons flying around. But to take a step back and rethink how you would normally do things.
723,0,Received as described and quickly but I should have done more research because this is not my cup of tea.
724,0,"For those who enjoy mythology and fantastic tales this book is for you. Plenty of fights and battles between supernatural warriors. However the story revolves around the Monkey's personal journey, first to gain the knowledge to become powerful and inmortal, then his naughty adventures as an inmortal disrupting heaven, earth and hell and finally to redeem himself by helping Monk Xuanzang from China get the Buddhist sacred scriptures from the remote West (India)."
725,0, This book is like a Kung Fu flick from the Tang dinasty and it's a delightful first step to study the chinese literary tradition.
726,0,"How fortunate for Hsuan-tsang, the priest traveling to the West to secure authentic Buddhist scriptures from India to carry back to China, that he encountered Monkey, and Pigsy, and Sandy, who helped him and guarded him throughout his arduous journey. Read and enjoy this enchanting and celebrated folk tale from China."
727,0,splendid insight into the stories that form part of the Asian character today.
728,0,"I have an interest in learning the Chinese culture, and this was recommended to me by a Chinese student who told me that most Chinese students have read this book!"
729,0,Excellent!
730,0,This dude thanslates funny
731,0,"If you loved Kung Fu Hustle, and enjoyed Shaolin Soccer, you will love this. It's what I call a ""sneaky romantic comedy"" - none of the ham-fisted, heartstring pulling that Hollywood is so fond of, but touching and heartfelt all the same. Plus, the action sequences, CGI, and ass-kickery are top-notch. You won't be disappointed."
732,0,"Stephen Chow does it again!  A unique masterpiece from Hong Kong.  I don't know where he gets his ideas, but he had me mesmerized for the entire film.  I felt the same about his previous classics ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"".  The humor is side-splitting.  Everything is so tongue-in-cheek but what has enhanced all of his films are the special effects.  Amazing characters, sound effects and soundtrack.  I never give you guys spoilers or plots.  Just watch this and judge for yourself.  The box cover is all I share!  ALL 5 STARS!  Chow is a Champion of film."
733,0,I admit i've been a Stephen Chow Fan for a long time and it definitely helps to know some of the comedic style and cultural references to the famous Journey to the West mythology that has been retold and remade so many times. And there are so many refreshing angles that Chow took that were pleasantly unexpected. I hesitated to invest time and money on one of Chow's not starring films!? Get out of here! Can't be good right? Wrong. His presence is so strongly felt even without his screen presence. The story just breezed by without any lulls and I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. For the non Chow initiated film collector looking for a audio visual feast you won't be disappointed with top notch graphics and action. The genius of his story telling and comedy is understandable to a wide audience. Example. His first scene there is an intense water battle which becomes a see saw balancing act (a visual reference we can all appreciate from our childhood) I can't wait to show this one to others. And maybe watch it in English next time. I watched in the original language with subs and I don't speak the dialect.
734,0,As a martial arts movie fan my expectations are set reasonably low. I want characters without too much depth and an easy to follow plot. This movie delivers! The abilities and powers of the fighters are delightful and the motivations perfectly one dimensional. Great for a lighthearted evening of popcorn and goofy laughs.
735,0,"While not the best of his films (like Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer) this is still a great film. Anyone a fan of his other stuff should give this one a shot. For those wondering, yes this does have an English Dub track. I watched this on Netflix and all they had was English Sub. So I was hesitant buying the blu-ray because some people said it had it, while others said it did not."
736,0,"If you're looking for the perfect movie to spend about 2 hours watching with the love of your life eating popcorn and sour patch kids.  This is the movie for you.  Make a memory, share a laugh, get excited, be afraid.  All that is possible with this movie.  Just know that once that two hours is gone you're going to ask yourself two important questions.  1) What the hell did I just watch?  2) Is there more where that came from, because I need there to be more."
737,0,The answers to those questions are. 1) Does it really matter?  That was freaking awesome wasn't it? 2) Yes.  Try Kung Fu Hustle if you haven't already.
738,0,"All the credit goes to his co stars Wen Zhang and Huang Bo. Who steal the show instanstly. From Stephen Chow, (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle), brings his lastest and most crazy movie yet, Journey To The West. The story of Xuan Zang, taking his disciples on the journey to the west. But before the that comes just a simple demon hunter (Xuan Zang) trying to slay demons with nursery rhymes bringing out their inner goodness. More actors include Shu Qi as Miss Duan, Show Luo as Prince, Xing Yu as Fist of the North Star. And the brightest and biggest Zhang Chao Li as Almighty Foot. Stephen Chow has proved to become a huge success with his films and proved to be even crazier with his ideas making Journey to the west his most Outrageous movie yet."
739,0,"This is a well filmed movie based upon folklore. The writing and acting were over the top.  The action and Cinema Graphics blend so well and look as if your watching a reality show.  The movie is subtitled in English for the non Chinese speaking audience. A classic to be placed next to the Blind Swordsman.  This is really a funny, non stop action movie mixed with monstrous demons and hard kicking antiheroes. ."
740,0,"Anything Stephen Chow has a hand in is great.  I personally love Chinese fantasy movies and this one is truly an adventure in China's mythical past.  Reading Sub Titles does not take away from this movie or listen to it in English Dubbed, which is done very well on this film.  Take it from me go out and find other movies that Stephen Chow was involved in.  When he is a character in his or anyone's films it just rocks. If I had one super wish in life its would be to meet Stephen Chow, he has given me a great happiness in the roles he has portrayed, I wish he could make dozens of more movies before he decides to retire.  You can't beat him or Jackie Chan."
741,0,"This was very creative.. and very funny.. and I loved the actors, the direction, the dialogue.. the effects.. the jokes within jokes about any and all movies of this type. I wish the subtitles were EASIER.. I think they must test these on 20 year olds.. but that's often the case with subtitles so... not really bad."
742,0,I seriously recommend this movie. Anyone say 13 or over..although it's not sexy or dirty except in very mild ways.. in fact.. a couple of the scenes of romance are soooo funny I might even say go to age 11.
743,0,Really great flik!
744,0,"I'm reading this weekly with my third grade students. I personally enjoy the story, but can't believe how much they're into it. I thought without pictures I'd be in for some trouble because this is my first time with a Kindle book on the projector. Yet, it works."
745,0,"Initially, I began reading the story with my booming stage voice to keep them interested, but I looked around and saw ten hands raised. I thought they were just going to bug me about getting water so they could get away so I ignored them for a bit. Then, one student blurted, ""Can I read?"" Well...sure. This continued until just about everyone in the room read a page."
746,0,"Now, I read first and the others read it after I've completed a few pages. They're really into it and learning some huge words at the same time. But I don't have to define too much so it works out."
747,0,My class loves this.
748,0,"On a more personal note, I had no clue how much Dragon Ball ripped from Sun Wukong. I was amazed and thrilled to read it. It keeps me entertained with or without the kids. I get a little upset when they ask me a question while we're reading it."
749,0,"Short read, of course, but a classic. Shepard's info at the back regarding his adaptation and the research that went into this version is interesting...perhaps as interesting as the tale itself. As he says, this is a condensation or just a part of the whole story (probably by 吴承恩), which is available to read, but this is certainly able to stand on its own. Great thing about these tales is that the hero doesn't always come out on top...or come out as a hero. There are lessons to learn, we just have to seek them out."
750,0,A great introductory book to the many fables of the Monkey King.
751,0,It is fun. It is exciting. It is everything a little boy with special needs wanted.
752,0,"Not having any inkling of the Monkey King, this boy was introduced to its fables by word. Stories were told to him through memories and it is such a great feeling for him to actually have a book where his own mother could read and read again the fables."
753,0,"This is a humorous retelling of a 16th century Chinese tale, or at least this is what we are told. Monkey is a kind of superman, but he doesn't seem all that bright. His parent was a magic stone, which being a stone could not talk and never gave him a name. He served as a king for some four hundred years but became bored and wanted a higher position. He went to learn with the Patriarch who taught him magic arts and made him immortal. Then he decided he wanted to be a god. His adventures are sometimes ridiculous but always funny and many readers will enjoy them."
754,0,"The universally known stories in a culture have a profound and lasting influence in the mindset of growing children they are told to, and mark the continuity of tradition when repeated to their own children. This is true in every culture and this story is the ultimate in Chinese children stories. Not only does this story contain numerous character studies, conflicts and scenes that have entered into linguistic/world view idiom, but hidden inside this story are cryptic allusions to deep Buddhist and Taoist training. The full version of this story has 100 books and some authors have considered this story on par with such classics as the Tao-Te-Ching."
755,0,"This version is a good introduction to this story, the sort to give you a taste or to read to a child. I have a dozen versions of this story and while this is not my choice as the best short-popular version, it is close. Further, this author has released this text for the Kindle for 1 penny! This is the world's greatest bargain. Absolutely everyone should load this on their reader..."
756,0,As an aside...
757,0,"I hope that many like myself will purchase his dead tree version of the book and put it on their shelf, prove to publishers and Amazon that this is a good economic model. May many more authors release inexpensive e-book versions of texts as a promotion of their work. There is presently a vast quantity of high quality free audio books by authors trying to break in or grow their base, for traditionally published material. I regularly purchase texts that I have listened to or heard for free on the NPR Radio Reader program."
758,0,"I personally have been less than enthused with the universal $10 price for kindle books, the overall reading experience and utility is not the equivalent of a paper book. Given that 99.9% of the infrastructure costs such a printing, ink, paper, transport and warehousing are nonexistent for e-books, $10 is exorbitant.  I generally feel that if the paper back version of a book is available for $15 compared to a $10 Kindle e-book, I would unhesitatingly go with paper."
759,0,"There is a lot of inexpensive e-book content ""notably - Author 50-years-dead stuff"" but much of the contemporary less than $5 content is barely spam. I hope that the Kindle consumer community will spot and recommend high quality inexpensive content; review and recommend it to others. Vote with your voice and and wallet (mouse-click) for this content to knock publishers of their high-horse..."
760,0,"As a westerner, I didn't grow up with Monkey and Journey to the West, only coming across it as an adult. It's a great story, though, and as fundamental  to Chinese culture as the Grimm fairy tales are to Euro-American culture. I got this short book to read to my grandchildren so they wouldn't have to wait as long as I did to encounter this entertaining rascal."
761,0,Classic entertainment.
762,0,"If I'm not mistaken, this is adapted from 16th century Chinese lore.  It's the preamble to Journey to the West - a super-bizarre, larger than life superhero story about a badass super-strength monkey (named Monkey - what up creativity?) with a several-ton staff that changes size at will."
763,0,Anyone who's played the PS3 / 360 game Enslaved - it's a weirdly-adapted version of this story... kind of.
764,0,"This - and Aaron Shepard's entire series of culturally diverse children's story adoptions, are well worth a read."
765,0,"It makes me want to read its source material, which I gather was its point. I've always been a bit of a mythology fan, and Asian mythology is a fascinating contrast to the Greek/Roman and Norse that I'm most familiar with. One star off for feeling somewhat incomplete, though I suppose that was part of the plan for getting me to read the original."
766,0,"Aaron Shepard does for folklore and epic poems what Charles and Mary Lamb did for Shakespeare in the 1800's--produces short, exciting, plot-centered adaptations that make the originals accessible to readers young and old, and that may tempt you to dip into the real thing someday."
767,0,"Design and editing is admirable, too."
768,0,A good retelling of the origin of Monkey and an introduction to Chinese mythology that encourages you to learn more.
769,0,"I've know Ray for better than 50 years.  This book is just one chapter in his exciting life as author, editor, firearms expert, musician, traveler,"
770,0,"pilot, electronics technician, and good friend.  He has done things we ordinary people can only dream about.  Well worth reading."
771,0,"Jim Gould, Ann Arbor, MI."
772,0,"I'm not sure what I expected, but with a brother who lived in Alaska for several years, I guess I was looking for a different perspective...and wow, did I get it!  A travel notebook, short stories, a diary, and an all-around interesting book.  When I got to the end, I was sorry it was over."
773,0,"Thank you, Ray, for a great read!  God Bless!"
774,0,Fr. Bob
775,0,"Great read. Realistic observations without the melodramatic BS ( You know 'THERE I WAS WITH A BIG GRIZZLY CHARGING FROM MY RIGHT AND A MOOSE CHARGING FROM MY LEFT) . His very realistic battles to keep his stove burning. that is no less deadly. The compassion of the others there; Warm you, feed you , advise you, send you on your way His use of space was educational to me. I continue to fill the space around me 'til there are pathways left. I will loan it to a friend who wants to go. and get it back so I can read it again. It points out Alaska is not for the faint of heart or the stupid."
776,0,"I love the honesty and integrity of this book!  His descriptions of the wilderness are drawn with real love.  The first third of the book, about what is needed in the North, got boring, but the rest of the book was worth it!  As an ex-Alaskan, this book rings True!!"
777,0,"If you want to know what's it like to live totally, (kind of,) on your own in a wonderful, horrible place like back country Alaska this book is for you."
778,0,"Got repetitive,,would have liked more detail about getting food, salary, cooking, etc. but still pretty good"
779,0,What a wonderful descriptive trip Ray takes you on as you travel with him on his experiences in Alaska. He pulls no punches as he describes his victorious decisions and the ones that defeated him. An enjoyable education on keeping your cool while enduring the best and worst of what Mother Nature can bring to you. A very enlightening read!
780,0,"Very interesting story about a strange and lonely, but voluntary, lifestyle."
781,0,I'm half way through and can't put it down. Good reading with alot of details.
782,0,"If you've ever wanted to visit the wilds of Alaska, even if only from your lazy-person chair, you must read this book.  Both highly entertaining and informative, it's the real scoop on a very real challenge with Mother Nature."
783,0,"I have reached, with sadness, the end of my journey through the four-volume, four-hundred-year-old Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu, then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story."
784,0,"  It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses. Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love. True, there are dragons and monsters and mythic battles, but of the two main characters, one is an ugly, ultra-violent, supernatural monkey, and the other is a timorous, puritanical monk. Moreover, the narration is less immersed in the characters' viewpoints than I usually prefer, partly because it frequently breaks into poetry. Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic. It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc. While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions, the characters and the situation change slowly, sometimes imperceptibly."
785,0,"  Any or all of the above might have deterred me. Had I been in a more cantankerous mood, perhaps they would have done so. Yet they did not. By and large, I liked the digressions into poetry. I accepted the cowardice of one character, the violence of the other, the less-than-immersive narration, the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels. I liked the lightness of tone, the sense of fun. Most of all, I grew fond of the characters, as I think the author was fond of them. I wanted to spend time in their company, and am left now, at the end of the long journey, missing them."
786,0,Purchased the four volumes in the series to read the inspiration behind the countless television shows and films depicting the eponymous Monkey.
787,0,"Wonderfully written and translated, the text is accessible and easy to read, never descending into dogma or rigid theology. The amount of text is certainly a challenge for the more casual reader though. A prolific introduction by the translator/publisher provides an in depth look at the history of the text, its origins, writing style and other information relevant to the contents, adding another level of understanding."
788,0,"Surprisingly enjoyable, and certainly entertaining, if the story of WuKong intrigues you, then this translation is a very worthwhile read."
789,0,This is a translation of classic Chinese Buddhism tales.  The writing appears faithful the style of the Chinese stories and old styles of telling stories.  It is worth reading to get a better understanding of tales virtually every Chinese child learns at an early age.  The whole series helped me in my appreciation of Chinese culture.
790,0,"A must read book for all avid reader!  So read and buy it or you miss out on a great adventure. Brought all the series of this book title of the same author since I like the ""Journey to the West"" movie a lot (only the movies made in the 1980s and 2014 on youtube) and want to find out how different the movies is from the book.  The book is way different than my favorite J tt W in 1980s movie version for sure, but I still like the book story."
791,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
792,0,"Very readable translation. I don't know how accurate it is, the poetry seems to be almost too good, but I really enjoyed it. Those who are not familiar with this style might want to start with The Bandits of the Marsh or Romance of the Three Kingdoms before tackling the 4 volumes of the Journey to the West."
793,0,"This is the final volume of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  You can feel the long and arduous journey to India coming to an end at last, along with the end of the even longer and harder journey from immaturity to maturity. The point of the Monkey King's very first teacher, ""Nothing in the world is difficult, only the mind makes it so"" comes back to the fore in this brilliant wrap up to a story that has no equal.  If you have been using some visual aids, such as the CCTV production, to help with your comprehension up to this point, my advice is not to use them for the last part of this volume.  The arrival of the group at Vulture Peak and all the incredible human vices, bureaucratic red tape and mistakes that occur from that point on are most impressionable if experienced in the imagination though reading."
794,0,Fascinating look into the mythology of China.
795,0,"Hey, this is the ""Journey to the West"". one of the best fantasy adventures of all times.  I wish I had read it as a child, or had it read to me. It was extremely fun and entertaining. This was the first time I had read the novel.  I had seen a few movies that lead up to or were a truncated version of the actual story.  Finally learning who the ""Handsome Monkey King"" was enlightening and aided my comprehension of a Taoist text I had read that discusses the ""monkey mind"" frequently.  While the acknowledged hero in the story is the Buddhist monk who is sent on the journey to the west to retrieve sutras from the Buddha, the real hero is Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King!?! He's the wildest hero I've ever read about.  It takes a while to get the actual journey by all 4 pilgrims but I enjoyed reading how the Sun Wukong became the Monkey King and created such a ruckus in Heaven! Anyone who ever created a comic book or animated superhero must have read or heard of this story and used a variety of Sun Wukong's powers to create their hero.  this will be yet another novel that I'll read at least once per year."
796,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."
797,0,"If you’re familiar with any Chinese folklore, it’s probably this story. But you probably know it as “Journey to the West.”  It’s not only been released in numerous editions as a novel, it’s also been adapted for film, stage play, and I’m sure there must be a video game of it out there."
798,0,"If you’re thinking, “Chinese folklore? Sounds boring.” Think again. This is a superhero story. Monkey, also known as the Monkey-King and “Great Sage Equal to Heaven,” is an immortal who has all manner of supernatural powers. He can fly. He can make copies of himself. He can transform himself—either disguising himself as another being or appearing as an inanimate object. He has an iron truncheon that can be the size of a sewing needle or a mile long and which is indestructible. Wielding said staff, he can defeat armies or deities."
799,0,"In fact, the flaw in this story isn’t a lack of adventure or thrill. On the contrary, it’s one adventure after the next. If anything, the flaw is “Superman Syndrome.” That’s what I call it when the hero is so ridiculously overpowered that even when he’s fighting gods, dragons, or whole armies there’s still no doubt about the outcome."
800,0,"Of course, the Monkey does eventually meet his match in the form of the Buddha. The Buddha defeats Monkey not in combat, but in a bet.  That event shifts the direction of the story. In the early chapters, Monkey is goes about heaven and earth arrogantly wreaking havoc. He’s not altogether detestable. He does have his redeeming traits, but he’s insufferably arrogant and mischievous. After he’s imprisoned following his run-in with the Buddha, a monk is assigned to go to India to bring back scriptures (hence, a “journey to the west”) to China. Monkey is assigned to be the monk’s guardian and along with two others that they pick up along the way (Pigsy and Sandy) the monk is escorted on his journey. The party faces one challenge after the next, and the trip is long and arduous. Some of the challenges require brute force but in many cases they are battles of wits. So while Monkey may be overpowered, he does experience personal growth over the course of the story."
801,0,"The story is told over 30 chapters, each set up with a cliffhanger. I enjoyed this translation by Arthur Waley. It is end-noted, which is useful given the historic and cultural nuances that may not be clear to readers."
802,0,"It should be noted that this is unambiguously a Buddhist tale. There is a bias against Taoists and other non-Buddhist religions evident throughout the story. It’s not just the fact that the Buddha easily defeats Monkey when no other deity or group of deities can, there’s a steady stream of anti-Taoist sentiment. So, Taoists and Chinese Folk Religion practitioners be warned, I guess."
803,0,"I would recommend this book for fiction readers, particularly if you have an interest in the superhero genre or Chinese literature."
804,0,"This version of Journey to the West exudes a perfumed wind. Waley is the greatest of translators from Chinese.  While this is abridged and cannot match the magisterial but stiffer version of Anthony Yu, it is just right for an introduction to this fabulous work. Many who read this will want to tackle Yu. Many others would not wish it longer than it is. Waley occupies a happy position at the boundary between these two groups."
805,0,"Wonderfully funny and sometimes poignant ancient classic novel about pilgrimage by the wild and resourceful Monkey King and the diffident Tripitaka, Monkey's nominal master."
806,0,Here's one of my favorite quotes from the novel.
807,0,"""They travelled on for many days and autumn had already come when late one evening Tripitaka reined in his horse and said, 'Disciple, where are we going to halt to-night?'  'Master,' said Monkey, 'that is a question for ordinary men to ask, not for such pilgrims as we.' 'Wherein lies the difference?' asked Tripitaka.  'Ordinary people at this hour,' said Monkey, 'are hugging their children or cuddling their wives in soft beds under warm coverlets, lying snug and comfortable as you please.  But how can we pilgrims expect any such thing?  By moonlight or starlight on we must go, supping on the air and braving the wet, so long as the road lasts.’"""
808,0,"Its journey to the west but in a more compact read.  The monk travels westward to spread buddhism but has quite a journey.  The read journey to the west is too long for undergraduate students.  So I can assign this to them since is only about 300 pages.  The full length translation by the same person is 4 volumes and about 1200 pages.  I recommend the full length version if you are reading for your personal enrichment of reading a Chinese classic.  If you just want a quick read to understand the legend better than any movie, TV show, or children's book, then this is a fine abridged version of the translation I enjoy most and bought the last time I was in China.  To be honest, none of the popular culture shows or childrens' books I have seen here, or in China, are anywhere close to the actual book.  They just borrow some of the characters and call it Monkey King.  This is the real deal and, thus, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! One of my favorites ever!"
809,0,Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult. I was so happy to see this reprint in paperback.
810,0,"The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism as well as satirizes Chinese society of the 16th century. Monkey is, as to be expected, hilarious. There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet, so I'll not waste your time writing what others have already written.  Just know you'll enjoy!"
811,0,"The pre-chosen descriptions of the plot mood, characters and pace that Amazon provides are no match for the wonder of the book. Monkey has entertained children and elders in China for 1000 years. There are movies, songs, and spin-off tales. Donnie Yen just did a new movie in 2014 based on this book,and in 2013 Journey to the West was released in theaters. That's the mark of a book with staying power!  It's a fun read with twists and turns and magic and all the splendor and wonder you expect from China 1000 years ago. Think of the most sensational and unreal Kung-Fu movie you ever saw with flying swords and beasts and rooftop fights, magic fists, Crouching Tigers and Dragons and mystery. That is this book in it's ancient glory. You may love this, or you may find your child enthralled with the characters, plot and wonder of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, or the Jade Princess, or the demon catcher..."
812,0,"""Monkey"" is the story of the Monkey-king, acting as a guarding of a Buddhist monk in his travels to the west. Don't let this description mislead you. It is not a lofty, religious book. It IS an action-packed adventure thriller, with some touches of philosophy and fantasy."
813,0,"What I liked most about this book it is that it does not obey the norms (or guidelines) of western literature. The heroes can be cowards, betrayal is completely expected, good and evil are not opposites. Very refreshing, and keeps you on your (mental) toes."
814,0,Highly recommended!
815,0,Monkey is an incredible tale that I read as a child and am looking forward to reading again as an adult. To find this old edition in such good quality and at such a reasonable price was a boon.  The seller was prompt and the book came securely packaged.
816,0,"The story itself is a wonderful comedic adventure that provides insights into Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism as well as satirizes Chinese society of the 16th century. Monkey is, as to be expected, hilarious. There are many reviews of the story if you search the internet, so I'll not waste your time writing what others have already written.  Just know you'll enjoy!"
817,0,"Mama used to read ""between bites"" at the dinner table to keep seven kids quiet and interested, and let Dad enjoy his dinner. She looked for books that had a beautiful flow to the language that would attract even the baby, simple enough basic story lines that the little kids would enjoy it, enough adventure to attract the middle kids, and deeper, subtler meanings to engage the older kids and adults. This one, Monkey, by Wu Ch'eng-en, translated by Arthur Whaley, was top contender, and I heard it read aloud many times in my childhood, always with enjoyment, always learning more. (The other most-repeated books were Kipling's Kim and Tolkein's The Hobbit.)"
818,0,"  It is the story of the irreverent magic Monkey King who had adventures on earth, tricked a sage into teaching him the secrets of magic and immortality, and then created havoc on earth and in the beaurocracy of heaven. (Mama explained that the idea of beaurocracy is deeply ingrained, and that people tend to imagine their afterlife to be ideal versions of what this one might be.) As punishment Monkey was imprisoned for 500 years under the Mountain of the Five Elements, and as penance was to accompany and protect the priest Tripitaka on a journey from China to India to bring back copies of sacred scrolls, to bring the true teachings of the Buddha to China."

820,0,"Some people know the character Son Goku, from the Japanese cartoon series Dragon Ball Z.  Others are familiar with Pokemon's Infernape.  And still more know a similar character from a TV miniseries shown in the US in 2001 called The Lost Empire.  Rumor has it that Jet Li will collaborate with Jackie Chan to portray a Sun Wukong-like character in the forthcoming movie The Forbidden Kingdom.  What fans of these characters may not know, is that they are all based on China's infamous Sun Wukong--or The Monkey King."
821,0,"The tale of the Sun Wukong is one of the four major Chinese literary classics.  His 81-chapter story, called Journey to the West (Xi You Ji), was written by Wu Chen-En  in the 1500s.  Monkey's legend is based on the true story of a well-known monk, Xuan Zang (602-664), who traveled to Inida to bring the Sutra--the Buddhist holy book--to China to enlighten the people and improve their lives.  In Journey to the West, however, reality gives way to a much more entertaining and fantastic version of the story."
822,0,"Journey to the West is a hero's quest, elaborated with Monkey's supernatural powers, interlaced with Taoist and Buddhist practices and beliefs as well as common superstitions, embellished with fairy tales, monster stories, legends, and fables.  Some of the chapters read like superhero comics, others like instructional Bible stories.  Some parts of the story, as when Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy are hiding in a Temple and outwit the priests, are downright hilarious.  The Sun Wukong legend can be read as a hero-journey-quest, a political and social satire of rebellion against a corrupt government, or as pure fancy.  No wonder Journey to the West has endured for so long."
823,0,"It's hard to believe that as popular as Journey to the West has remained over the centuries, its author would never have admitted to writing it.  Wu Chen-En was a scholar and a statesman.  During the 1500s (Ming Dynasty), it was considered unfit for educated and high ranking men to read any kind of comic or popular literature.  Wu was influenced in writing this tale by the super-hero stories he read secretly while in school."
824,0,"The entertaining escapades of Sun Wukong have remained popular through the ages, inspiring operas, cartoons, and now movies.  The tale has even spawned a Sun Wukong festival, which features recreations of many of his adventures, and a statue of Monkey stands at a Buddhist temple in Sau Mau Ping in Hong Kong.  Chairman Mao was also a fan, who mentioned Monkey as a role model in many of his speeches.  He said people should emulate Monkey's fearlessness in thinking, doing work, striving for his objectives, and extricating China from poverty.  Sun Wukong is well-known and well-liked in modern times among children in Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, and Korea.  I think Wu Chen-En would secretly be very pleased!"

828,0,"Born a samurai, raised an American teenager, she died a Japanese princess. Sutematsu Yamakawa was born in 1860, in feudal Japan, into a family of the samurai class who were soon to find themselves on the losing side in Japan’s transformational, civil upheaval.

830,0,"DAUGHTERS OF THE SAMURAI: A Journey from East to West and Back, by Janice P. Nimura, is largely Sutematsu’s story; the story of two other girls of Japan, Shige Nagai and Ume Tsuda, who also spent the years 1872-1882 in America, learning the ways and whyfors of the hairy barbarians; and so much, and some many, more. A story of a society, of a world, in major transition; and of three leading, albeit softer, lights in that transition. And it is an indescribably amazing read."

835,0, I actually purchased this book on Amazon for a bargain price (Daughters of the Samurai: A journey from East to West and back by Janice P. Nimura) because my wife wanted to read it.  After she read the book she suggested that I read the book because of my interest in Japanese and American history.
836,0," This wonderful and highly informative historical tale tells the story of early Japan (1871) and how they sent men and women to America to learn our language and other educational topics in our schools (Grade, high school and college programs).  It was a time of great struggle for Japan who was trying to change from a feudal country to a modern society.  The turmoil was between the traditional Japanese cultural system promoted by the Samurai class to the modern western approach to modernization in Japan. This conflict led to many battles in the country."
837,0,"This is a story about three amazing girls sent by the Japanese government to America in 1871. These three girls came from the traditional Samurai families. This book chronicles the ten years they stayed in America learning English and other subjects and their return to Japan to become teachers (Sensei) focusing on the women’s education.  In the past, Japanese woman’s role was limited to taking care of the home and children.  Though I had read numerous historical books in the past on Japan this unique book covered areas I never had read bout in the other books."
838,0,This is a well written book that also has many photographs of the Japanese men and women who this book is all about.  Anyone interested in the history of Japan and the early American educational system will enjoy reading this book.
839,0,Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Zen Poetry Moments: Haiku and Senryu for special occasions).
840,0,"Janice P. Nimura’s wonderful book opens in 1871 with the empress of Japan dispatching three clueless girls - Sutematsu Yamakawa, age eleven; Shige Nagai, ten; and Ume Tsuda, six - to the United States. Their task was an almost impossible one: to learn the ways of the West so that their knowledge could be passed on to other Japanese women. Their journey lasted ten years."
841,0,"Nimura paints vivid portraits of each of the girls - the smart, overachiever Sutematsu, the arty Shige, the spoiled Ume. Two of the three end up at Vassar, with Sutematsu becoming the first Japanese woman to earn a American college degree."
842,0,"But back in Japan, they found a world turned upside down."
843,0,"“They were each of them, purebred daughters of the samurai,” the author writes, “they became hybrid by nurture,” not at home in America or their native Japan."
844,0,"“I cannot tell you how I feel,” Sutematsu said upon stepping foot in her native country, “but I should like to give one good scream.”"
845,0,Highly recommended.
846,0,"This is a slice of history unlike any other I have read. As Japan wrenched itself violently out of its medieval structure, five girls aged 7 to 12 were sent to the United States to live for a decade in which they were to become fluent both in English and western ways and then to return home to teach what they had learned to women in Japan. Given the almost random method of their selection, it is amazing just how well three of them succeeded, both here in the U.S. and then back in the still very tradition-bound Japan. An enjoyable and fascinating read."
847,0,"Janice Nimura provides a fascinating introduction to Meiji era Japan with its radical transition in Japanese society, through the lens of a group of young Japanese girls who travel to America to meet with President Grant and then return ten years later to a Japan that has partially transformed in their absence. Meanwhile, the girls have transformed also due to their exposure to the ways of Protestant New England and their western education. Every part of the book is full of surprises and delights. I found the return to Japan and the account of their later lives, sometimes divergent and sometimes intertwined, especially interesting."
848,0,"This book is about three remarkable Japanese women. Their stories are well told by the author. The three women --- Ume, Sutematsu, and Shige --- were chosen as children to take part in the transformation of Japan under the Meiji Revolution. In 1871, they were sent by the government to New England to be educated, charged with the mission of returning to Japan 10 years later to similarly educate Japanese girls and women. Ume, Sutematsu and Shige forged their own Japanese identities in New England and their own New England identities in Japan, becoming, in essence, global citizens of their own invention. At the core of their global citizenship was a strong and enduring sisterhood."
849,0,"An extremely interesting picture of the Japan that emerged under the Meiji Emperor and the ensuing effort to educate upper class women that led to the three principals being sent to the United States to study for ten years. The different paths they chose to follow upon returning to Japan reflected a struggle to balance their Western educations with Japanese tradition at the highest levels of society. The vignettes of the early days of Vassar and Bryn Mawr Colleges, which they attended, added to my enjoyment of the book."
850,0,"This is a fascinating book, the work of a serious historian with personal knowledge and care for Japan, its women, culture and relationship to the US over time. It's also a terrific story, illuminating a time when Japan changed from an isolated, closed society to one that looked outward for inspiration to modernize and to a small group of women to help make it happen. The men and women who brought about this change and the events leading to and from it come to life in Ms. Nimura's book."

853,0,"FASCINATING!  I've been researching this time period for some time on both fronts (American and Japanese) and this book both confirmed many of my theories and provided some extremely interesting additional information.  On top of that, it was absorbing reading even for a non-researcher and tells a story few people know about.  Extremely revealing of the thoughts and customs of the time."
854,0,Highly recommend it!
855,0,"I'm a Chinese speaker, but my daughter isn't. She has heard about the monkey king from us and was interested in hearing the story, so we ordered this book. The translation is slightly awkward, especially the inconsistent translation of names (some are translated by meaning, such as ""Piggy"" and some are phonetic translations of the Chinese name, such as ""Xuan Zeng""). I find myself frequently making changes to the translation or adding explanations to make it more understandable or interesting to my daughter. That being said, I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to translate this particular story into English and abridge it for young readers, so I'm not sure if there are much better versions out there or not."
856,0,"Long ago I saw on TV a Chinese series on this story, without subtitles, so I was looking for an English version to read.  This gave me the basic story line, but is definately for beginning readers.  Has a shortened story line with a play version included and a vocabulary section for the meanings of the words.  Great for teaching purposes for 1st through 3rd graders."
857,0,"The quality of the book is very good, the content translation is very good, and the mailing is very smooth."
858,0,"I became interested in this book after watching Forbidden Kingdom. The story of the Monkey King is thoughtful and entertaining.  The Kindle edition was a no brainer at 99 cents.  The translation is fantastic and it reads like it was written with English being its original language.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Monkey King, and/or Asian history."

860,0,"Saw the original John Wayne movie back in the day and I felt it was good but not my favorite movie that featured John Wayne (The Man Who Shot Liberty..., The Searchers, To name a couple).  The remake with Jeff Bridges, is, in my opinion among he best western movies ever made.  It follows the book very closely and the musical soundtrack built around Leaning in the Everlasting Arms is just perfect (I have also purchased the soundtrack).  Supporting cast is also  very strong, but I did kind of miss Glen Campbell...Growing up John Wayne was my absolute favorite film star and I still love his movies, but the remake of True Grif is one terrific movie!"

865,0,Rooster Cogburn: Backwards. I always go backwards when I back up.

Jeff Bridges makes an amazing Rooster Cogburn -- I was afraid he would just be Bad Blake in the West but not so; I did not realize immediately that LeBoeuf is portrayed by Matt Damon -- it's a Matt Damon I've never seen before, and has there ever been a funnier pretentious braggart of a Texas Ranger?; and Hailee Steinfeld is perhaps the most outstanding of all as Mattie Ross whose grit is truer than any man's."

878,0,I have only vague memories of the original True Grit. It came out in 1969 when I was but a sniveling milk-fed pumpkin of a child. I know John Wayne finally won an Academy Award for playing Rooster Cogburn. The original made so little impression on me that I didn't remember much of what it was about. Merely recall Rooster Cogburn's eye patch.
879,0,"So see the old movie if you want to make a comparison, but I don't know that I'd waste my time on it. Go with today's True Grit and God bless the Coen Brothers."
880,0,"Rooster Cogburn: [LaBoeuf has been talking about malum prohibitum and malum in se] It astonishes me that Mr. LaBoeuf has been shot, trampled, and nearly bitten his tongue off, and yet not only does he continue to talk but he spills the banks of English."
881,0,"A new retelling and a new classic ! I didn't watch this until a few months after my purchase . I didn't really think too much of the old John Wayne version . I just couldn't believe that Jeff Bridges could pull this one off . Boy , was I wrong !! This movie rates with the greatest all time Westerns !! His attitude , his look and demeanor are perfect ! Hattie Steinfeld who plays Mattie is perfect , Matt Damon was perfect as the Ranger ,and the rest of the cast were as good in they're roles ! Too bad there can't be a PT. 2 !!!"
882,0,"Good stuff, great stuff, this version of True Grit will probably survive as one of the all-time classic Westerns. I started out giving it 4 stars because it is still ""new"", just changed it to 5, my gut instinct is it will stand the test of time."
883,0,"Jeff Bridges plays this one to the hilt as a grizzled bounty hunter. First time I saw it I thought he overplayed it, now I see that he completely possesses the Rooster Cogburn character and does not exceed what it demands. A wonderful performance, thoroughly entertaining and deep."
884,0,"This is a ""road picture""; an unlikely trio of seekers, including a teenage girl on a mission to avenge her father's death, and upstart Texas Ranger Matt Damon, are all in pursuit of outlaw Josh Brolin for different reasons. The arcane language is brilliant, the dialogue is as if from an old novel, charming and seemingly authentic to the period. Haven't read the book but this version, presumably the language as well, is purported to be closer to the bone than the John Wayne version. The writers and the Coen Brothers have excelled in creating a vintage illusion and the clothing, sets, staging also contribute mightily to the gritty feel of the Old West.  For a Western to be made in 2010 with instant classic written all over it is no small feat."
885,0,"Bridges could have won the Oscar for it, he was nominated, but he had won the prior year for Crazy Heart. Still, Little Hailee Steinfeld emerges here as a talent to watch, she truly possesses True Grit. Great story, great performances, a movie movie up there with Hollywood's best."
886,0,"If you're not an Ultraviolet user, or looking for a review of the movie itself, then this review won't be relevant to you.  But for those who care about digital downloads, it's important to note this title doesn't include Ultraviolet rights, just an iTunes or Windows Media download."
887,0,"I purchased the Blu-ray/DVD Combo with Digital Download, which these days almost always means it will include Ultraviolet rights redeemable at a store like Vudu or Flixter, and sometimes a choice of an iTunes or Windows Media download as well.  True Grit is listed in the Ultraviolet database, so typically a Blu-ray of it that includes a digital version would mean you'll get a UV code.  Not so with this version.  If you opt to purchase it and want to add it to your UV library, plan to pay another $2 for disk to digital conversion on Vudu."

889,0,Spoiler Warning Below
890,0,"The main character is in a life or death situation and the leading man rides a horse to death to save her life.  It is a tear jerking representation of how hard life could be in the Wild Wild West, but the rider gives everything he can to save this little girl and it is very touching.  I only say this because kids watching who have not been exposed to death & understand that the horse gave its life to save the girl may be upset."
891,0,"This version of True Grit is just magnificent filmmaking in every aspect.  The Coens have an almost preternatural affinity to Portis's writing and the acting, the writing, and sheer visual artistry are first rate.  I'm a big Coen Bros fan - but have occasionally been let down by some of their snark.  This movie has very little of it.  It's true to the story, mostly champions (or has empathy for) all of its characters - a true rarity for the Coens - and provides the type of movie experience that I keep bemoaning doesn't exist any more.  Well, here it is - and it's a great tale told with humor, pathos, gorgeous imagery, and superb acting.  Jeff Bridges is right on the money here, as is Matt Damon.  But it's that Steinfeld girl who truly owns the film.  I can't recommend this film enough."
892,0,"I've seen this several times but wanted a visiting friend to see it and compare to the older version.  She thought it was great.  I really enjoyed John Wayne's version, of course, but that handsome Jeff Bridges was one mess of a law enforcement officer.  Matt Damian was great as the Texas Ranger, and the ""Baby girl"" was also very good.  Very authentic language.  Absolutely loved the soundtrack. It was interesting to compare the two versions.  Some scenes were almost identical, and others put a new twist on the story."
893,0,"We were purists.  We thought nothing could be better than the original.  Not true.  We love this version!  The dialogue is a delight!  It appears the writer and director were operating on the premise that people of that era wouldn't have used contractions (I mean would not have used them:).  So the dialogue takes on a cadence that is unfamiliar to the modern ear but thoroughly delightful.  Barry Pepper is truly disgusting as the bad guy.  How did they get his mouth and teeth to look so horrible?!  And the way he spat when he looked down at his 'victim' eww!!  Jeff Bridges plays a terrific, sort of pickled Rooster Cogburn.  I am not in the least a Matt Damon fan, but he plays his role as a Texas Ranger to perfection.  It's not clear at any given moment whether we should be laughing at him or rooting for him, so we have to wait and let the movie play out to arrive at our answer.  And this girl; I don't know where they found her, but she absolutely makes the movie!  She's not at all irritating like the girl in the original version.  Her character comes across as very capable, very determined and very likable!  If you're a fan of westerns, you need to add this to your collection!"
894,0,"I saw the John Wayne version of this film in a theatre in 1970.  In my opinion this was his best performance of his career.  Later, I read the book.  I love both versions of the film, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Coen brothers.  They really followed the book.  As Matty states, ""You must pay for everything in this life. Nothing is free except the grace of God.""  She pays a heavy price for justice.  The Coen brothers portrayed the ""spirit"" of the story completely.  And every actor was totally believable in his/her part.  An incredible work of art."
895,0,"I've heard so much about this award-winning cartoon series, and I'm so excited that I found it on Prime! This is the most unique children's series I've seen. The art is gorgeous and the characters are so cute and lovable. I hope more episodes can be made available soon! Monkey King stories is the most classic Chinese novel and inspired so many movies and TV (even original Dragonball was inspired by it). But this might be the first series that made the story suitable for younger children. Great intro to Chinese culture and classic literature for the kids - maybe my kid will even pick up a few chinese words you never know :)"

903,0,"When I saw this film the first time, I thought it was okay. My preconceived notion of a white protagonist in an essentially all-Chinese cast got the best of my bias leading to me to believe it could've been better. The second time I saw it, I liked it a little more. The subtlety of the story and a few of the themes managed to get a little more empathy out of me. The third time I saw it (as of this review) with all of the extra features and having just been severely disappointed by the big-screen adaptation of The Last Airbender, I now love it. The Forbidden Kingdom is a prime example of how to fuse Eastern atmospherics with Western storytelling, something not easily done in recent memory aside from a handful of titles like Crouching Tiger, Hero, and Huo Yuan Jia (aka Fearless). Granted those are all strictly Chinese productions spoken in Chinese (i.e. more authentic), but what I find so great about Forbidden Kingdom is the degree of detail taken in really capturing the mysticism, fantasy, and martial arts essence of classic Chinese cinema and turning it into an adventurous kind of fairytale that can appeal to both Eastern and Western audiences alike. With people like Peter Pau (Crouching Tiger's photographer), the great Yuen Woo-Ping (choreographer to a lot of great martial arts movies), and two of the biggest Chinese stars in Jackie Chan and Jet Li, it's a grade-A crew. But big props to director Rob Minkoff, producer Casey Silver, and writer Jon Fusco for putting it all together. Thematically, I think the story represents two very important things: the journey West (as in Eastern beliefs and ideals coming to Hollywood), and a little bit of hero/idol-worship (sort of an inverted take on the journey East, since the whole thing was filmed over there and with a Chinese crew). The result was, for me, a very enjoyable film with a little bit of everything (action, adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy). On the downside, the fact that 75% of the movie is in English tends to detract the Chinese actors' performances a little, but I don't think the subtlety would've worked as well without it. But for what it is, I still think it makes for a great kind of escapism compared to another particular movie."
904,0,Video - 4.5
905,0,"As mentioned above, the photography for the movie was done by Oscar-winner Peter Pau of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And with that said, the video quality of Forbidden Kingdom has a very vibrant and lush presentation. Colors are bold, putting audiences right in the middle of some very beautiful locations around China. As most people probably know from his highly-acclaimed work in Crouching Tiger, the presence of deep green bamboo forests are present yet again in this movie, providing a lot of the same visual nuance and elegance seen there. Image detail is also excellent showing a lot of the fine textures and facial features in the backgrounds, costumes, and actors. Black levels have a nice inky quality to them as well and help in balancing out a lot of the subtle colors in the set design. Contrast is fine, and overall image quality rarely falters throughout the film's run. There were a few times where the image appeared a little softer, though it's never a major distraction. All in all, a great job by the crew, and kudos to Lionsgate for the excellent transfer."
906,0,Audio - 5.0
907,0,"While the picture quality is just short of perfect for me, the 7.1 DTS-HD track delivers on all aspects. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Every nuance in the sound effects ranging from forest noise to wind blowing to water dropping is flawless. Dialogue stays clear and understandable (despite some thick accents) through the center channel with no dropout or quality issues. Separation is by far the most crucial factor dividing all sorts of noise throughout the front, sides, and rears. Pay especially close attention during any of the big battle sequences either one-on-one or group-versus-group. No matter how many people there are or how big the stage is, every single voice, sound effect, and chord of music come through clear and sharp. But my favorite scene is the fight between Jackie and Jet. A good deal of LFEs will literally roar your room when Jackie starts fighting in Tiger stance. There are also many other instances within the movie when a lot of body hits make for a nice bassy oomph as well. Outstanding effort by the people at Lionsgate."
908,0,Extras - 4.0
909,0,"For what little there is quantitatively, there's actually a surprising amount of depth in the extras. The most riveting of them is in the P-i-P commentary which takes most of the other behind-the-scenes stuff, dices them into the movie, and adds a little more length to their overall importance. Mind you, the standalone extras are still good in their own right and worth watching (all in HD, too), but fans of the movie should definitely give each of these a watch. Topics discussed cover a lot of ground ranging from production, logistics, shooting, general perspective on both Chinese filming and overall culture and how it's perceived in the West, the conditions in which the film came to be written and cast, and much more. I found all of them to be quite informative and hope that in seeing this movie, more audiences (myself included) will find something to explore and discover beyond just Hollywood."

911,0,"To this day, I consider The Forbidden Kingdom to be amongst my favorite martial arts fantasy epics. It does an excellent job of blending East and West and makes for a very fun adventure movie. It's something of an oddity in that I feel it's geared more towards the kung fu fanboy in all of us, but at the same time it somehow manages to stand on its own as a kind of fairytale story as well. With some of the top of the top in production crew and cast, the film is a wonderful experience in discovery and movie-watching and is presented with excellence in another great effort by Lionsgate. Highly recommended for martial arts and fantasy fans."
912,0,"An absorbing adventure, based on Chinese mythology, that keeps you glued to the scene for its entire length. Beautiful scenery, engrossing action, mysterious persons, subtle humor, wisdom, and growth of the various characters in the course of the film all contribute to the experience. The plot focuses on an American teenager, who ""knows"" all about Gung fu and its associated mythologies until he is magically transported into that very world, which is filled with glory to be sure, but also contains its share of tragedy--a study in yin and yang."
913,0,"What a treat to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li, both of them in double roles, work together onscreen, once more demonstrating their skill in their respective versions of martial arts! Jackie Chan continues with the deceptively relaxed style that his fans will always associate with ""The Legend of Drunken Master."" Similarly, once again we  see the incredible precision that is Jet Li's trademark. Relative newcomer at the time of filming, Liu Yifei, as the Golden Sparrow, fulfills all of our expectation in a demanding role covering a range of subtle emotions as well as a smooth agility in martial arts."
914,0,"Early Chinese martial arts films followed the style of wu xia, in which the leading characters not only were experts at fighting, but also had magical skills. A mystical form of Daoist magic allowed them to fly short distances and perform other skills that go beyond any natural abilities. In the latter half of the twentieth century, films focused more on kung fu fighting skills, as demonstrated by Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and others. The 2000 film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" signaled the return of wu xia, and ""Forbidden Kingdom"" has shown that the trend has been continuing."
915,0,"The film is filled with characters out of Chinese mythology, e.g., the Jade Emperor and the Monkey King. Jackie Chan's Chinese character is one of the famous ""Eight Immortals"" of Chinese mythology, but his name, Lu Yan, though the name of a historical person, is not usually found among the group. His depiction seems to fit closest to Li Tie Guai, the old beggar with the crutch and the bottle of magic medicine, but he could also be one of the versions of Lan Cai He, the drunken derelict."
916,0,"5 of 5 stars for the fantasy adventure movie The Forbidden Kingdom. FK stars two of my favoriteaction actors in lead roles, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. I understand that this movie is based on a Chinese story of the Monkey King (btw I was born in the year of the Monkey). Jet Li plays the Monkey King who is captured by a evil lord and held forever. The magic staff (long pole) of the Monkey King makes it way thru time to a shop in LA. A young man (Michael Angarano) is given the staff by the shop keeper and told to return to its rightful owner. He finds that he has been transported to the Forbidden Kingdom where his adventure begins. First he meets a drunk man (Jackie Chan) and later a young lady ""the Sparrow"" (Yifei Liu)."
917,0,"A really nice story that is beautifully photographed. The wire line fights were good but as always seem fake (ah I mean super-natural). The story is good for the whole family. Great fight sequences (of course when you have Li and Chan). I specially liked how Li played the Monkey King during fight sequences. The beautiful sweetheart of the movie is the Sparrow (Liu). The sexy one is ""the Witch"" (Bingbing Li) with her magic hair."
918,0,A really wonderful fantasy movie and well worth the time to watch. I highly recommend this movie. The Blu-Ray has alot of behind the scenes materials and is well worth watching. Pass the popcorn and let's watch it again!
919,0,"Since I've been studding martial artes(Kung Fu, 7 Star Praying Mantis) for a year or so now, I thought it'd be cool to view the latest kung-fu flick. Obviously, as all Kung-Fu movies are, the main feature of Kingdom is sparring, and throughout, my inner nerd came out to say ""Bad Ass!"" on more than one occasion. But, as all martial artes movies are, fightings the strongs suit, while the story was lack-luster. Start off with a average joe who's fix is Hong Kong Hollywood, and soon, that's his reality, he trys to escape while fighting the immortal emporor. Which is fine, I'm not looking for a Metal Gear style story. But when you have two legends from the genre(Chan and Li), I'd expect everyone to step up their game(I'm looking at you Liu Yi Fei). But more importantly, why even have the American here? You have Jakie Chan(looking like the Chinese Jack Sparrow) and Jet Li fighting? Heck, I'd make that the whole movie. Never the less, it was neat to see the diffrent philosphy and items, that I've studied, talked about and used throughout."
920,0," Besides being an imspirational source for me me in technique, the Kingdom has a fine frequency of fighting for a film, but just blah in between."
921,0,"I enjoyed the movie. the chance to see two martial artists legends share the screen and spare against each other was a treat. I think it is the only movie where Li and Chan Share screen time and fight each other. though the wire work was a little over done, the martial arts choreography was otherwise good."
922,0,"my only complaint was the subtitles where out of sync. I am hard of hearing and subtitles are helpful to catch dialogue during parts of the movie when its hard to hear people talking or to clarify what is being said. the subtitles started out ok, but about halfway through, they became at least 5 -10 seconds out of sync with the audio."
923,0,"Imaginative writing in a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" vein with Arabian nights notes (the epic feel rather than specifically cultural).  Nice creativity with the crunch as well.  Becoming a fan of Christina Stiles' work."
924,0,good
925,0,"This is the full audio version of Arthur Waley's book ""Monkey"", itself an abridgement of ""Journey to the West"". Enjoy one of the pillars of Chinese culture, the story that permeates the fabric of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese film, literature, and manga, from ""Monkey Monkey"" to Dragonball, as rendered by a brilliant Sinologist, while stuck in your car."
926,0,"Kenneth Williams, the voice actor, wasn't ever given a Wade-Giles pronunciation chart, and so butchers Xuanzang's name, but luckily Waley renders it as ""Tripitaka"" for most of the novel, which Williams can't get wrong. Williams has a thick Received Pronunciation accent (that's the Queen's English for you non-Brits) which many will find hilarious, and which some will find unbearable."
927,0,"The story itself is quite funny in many places, even if it does drag (and if you think Waley's abridgement is long, wait till you see Anthony Yu's four volume complete English translation). It was written down some 400 years ago, and was a popular and widespread folk tale for at least 400 years before then, so don't expect the pacing of a 21st century novel."
928,0,"Monkey masters Daoist magic and after making a name for himself on earth, gets invited to Heaven, where they can keep an eye on him. He makes a mess of things there, then flees back to earth, and fights off the Heavenly Court's greatest warriors trying to take him back for punishment. After another stint in Heaven, he runs amok and, crime of crimes, eats the Jade Emperor's favorite peaches. Oh boy. For wreaking havoc in Heaven, the Buddha himself finally throws Monkey down to earth, puts a mountain on top of him, and tells him to think about what he's done."
929,0,"Five hundred years later, the Buddha takes pity on the barbarians living in China and directs Guanyin, the goddess of mercy, to order a holy man from China to travel to India to get authentic Buddhist scriptures. She picks Xuanzang of course. The merciful goddess offers Monkey absolution and enlightenment if he lays aside his vile Daosit magicks, takes up the one true path of Buddhism, and serves Xuanzang on his journey to the west. Monkey has ""help"" from a pleasure-seeking pig, a quiet water spirit, and a dragon prince who transforms into a horse, all of whom are to be Xuanzang's disciples. Let's just say that priests will do what priests will do, and between naughty shenanigans, mighty battles, and a coup d'etat, the scriptures are fetched from India and conveyed back to China, this time by a magic cloud, before the whole party is taken back to Buddha's Shangri-la to live forever, rescued from the wheel of karma and reincarnation."
930,0,(Also available as an MP3 CD: 
931,0,. This review is from my review there.)
932,0,"Monkey's (audiobook) audio is hard to listen to. The transition to digital did not work. Kenneth Williams does a great job narrating, and there's a nifty ""echo"" effect that adds to the story, but... but... the audio quality makes it very hard to listen to on modern devices."
933,0,"Have really enjoyed this version of this story!  I had no problem understanding the author;  although it could be I was brought up surrounded by the British accent.  My only problem was that parts of it seemed fainter, with a fuzzy static, and I turned up the volume it would inevitably go back to normal."
934,0,"Full disclosure: I met Bruce several years ago when we discovered we were neighbors. Over coffee, in our many conversations about the state of the world (or the state of our own worlds,) we’ve sometimes discussed this book, without discussing it...and though I sensed it, I didn’t know this for sure until I read Auspicious Journey: A Gift if Peace In a Time of War."
935,0,"I’ve read many books about soldier’s experiences in Vietnam. Most are centered around, or document, battle experiences and the associated drama. (I always bear in mind that war is unimaginable for those of us fortunate not to have had to participate, and books and movies tend to provide we voyeurs, a window.)"
936,0,"In the fictional accounts I’ve read in the past, the usual theme is good vs evil and they mostly center on only those doing the fighting. The documentaries also seem to focus on the soldier’s plight. The conflict. There are certainly plenty of stories to tell about that."
937,0,"Auspicious Journey is different, though. It’s a story of a soldier’s relationship with the indigenous population nearby and what he learns. These are a people who are so used to living with war around them, it’s much like how we tolerate the wind. The character, Dan wonders how they do this because he himself struggles to meet each day in the midst of the horror that is war. Through his interactions, he gains an awareness of the entry point of the WAY, and how this occurs is wonderfully portrayed by the author. He shares the wisdom of a villager that is not easily learned by western minds. And he shares a snapshot of a culture not easily understood by western minds."
938,0,"Auspicious Journey is in effect, a story of a journey to the beginning of another journey."
939,0,"The journey of the character Dan is actually Bruce’s. And in certain respects, it was mine too as I read this book."
940,0,"Because at the end, I smiled and felt peace."
941,0,"This book is a memoir of the Viet Nam War.  When he writes about 1968 I recognize the events of the time from the bubbles of memory inside my huge head.  I recall the wild times I spent with his writing partner, ""the Budman"", drinking beer and smoking reefers as we checked out exquisite California college girls.  While we were partying this poor guy was in Viet Nam.  Here's where the story gets really strange.  He gets a plum job.  He goes into enemy areas and sets up health clinics for refugees in dire straits.  Instead of hatred he radiates care and concern and compassion.  Instead of playing soccer with gook heads like soldiers I heard about late in the 2th infantry myself, he was trying to save them diseases of poverty.  He's definitely a fish out of water whether he's in the barracks with the boys or with the long lines of sick people waiting to see him in the jungle."
942,0,You'll get a good view of his dilemma.  Who's side is he on?  This book is important today as Americans have lost their empathy for refugees overseas even as it rediscovers its concern for citizens in peril from forest fires or hurricanes.  You'll literally shake with fear as you face a live grenade in the hands of a desperate deserter.  But most of all you'll gain respect for the author that keeps his honor when everyone around him seems to have lost it.
943,0,"Bruce Junior West tells a deeply affecting story of the Viet Nam War, especially his time in a particular village that he is assigned to as a soldier in the CeeBees (Construction Battalion).  He comes to know and understand the villagers and their values and finds himself wedged between them and the lack of understanding and concern for life displayed by members of his army unit.  The story comes from West’s service experience and is told with heart and understanding.  I enjoyed reading “Auspicious Journey” very much and learned a great deal from it about the war and these Vietnamese villagers."
944,0,"At first glance, Auspicious Journey seems aptly titled. It is a compelling story of a journey undertaken by Dan, a Navy Seabee stationed near Da Nang Vietnam during its civil war. Dan is assigned to Hoa An village as part of the American effort to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese."
945,0,"Instead, his beloved teacher, Ong De, and the patient, loving village elders win Dan's heart and mind. He discovers a way of looking at the world that is totally alien to the worldview in which he was raised. This inner journey causes Dan nothing but trouble. He is torn between the American and Vietnamese views of the war, and his confused loyalties continually cause conflict with his military cohorts."
946,0,"The resolution of the tension caused by juggling two world views occurs at the end of his journey, when Dan realizes he has acquired peace of mind and a means to make some sense of a chaotic and confusing war. This seems a pretty auspicious event in the life of a young GI in spite of the grief it caused him while he was in Vietnam. Dan was singularly blessed to experience this often meaningless war in a manner that leads to his moral and spiritual growth."
947,0,"But, will Dan be able to incorporate his new understanding into his life when he returns to the States? Or, will he be even more at odds with his birth culture? Will he look back on his Vietnam journey as auspicious, or as the source of his inability to be at ease within his own country? Perhaps Dan's journey has only just begun."
948,0,"Nothing is as compelling as a novel that provokes one to pause, reflect, ponder and envision the humanity of a setting described, experience the pathos and poignancy that it recalls, and to marvel at the gifted, inspired way that the picture is shared.  Lessons are always best when made available to be found, and not pitched as a package wrapped with a bow.  Auspicious Journey is one of the rare and profound opportunities to experience a place and time thru other’s eyes, while feeling their conflicting experiences of disorientation, peril and trust, wolven together with a simple but powerful potency."
949,0,"In this elegantly straightforward and compelling tale, the author invites your discovery of opportunities in life, but on your terms.  Storytelling, at its best, blends personal insights with the knack of bringing the reader along, as if there to watch the unfolding saga. Auspicious Journey is one such gift to be savored."
950,0,"Auspicious Journey confirms that hope can be kindled in the least likely places. West’s protagonist, Dan, heads off to war as reluctantly as a lot of Viet Nam soldiers did, but unlike so many, Dan brings an earnestness, a curiosity, a true appreciation of humanity. And upon meeting the villagers in one tiny Vietnamese village, he finds more humanity than he ever imagined."
951,0,"A dark story illuminated by compassion, insight and respect for the Vietnamese culture. Mr. West’s portrayal of a Vietnam soldier who fights to keep his spirit afloat in an ever more soul-crushing war is uplifting in spite of its subject matter. The writing flows with vivid, sometimes beautiful images that contrast with its startling pictures of the horror that is war."
952,0,"The Tang priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand, along with their horse - a transformed river dragon - have to travel from the Tang court in China to the Western Heaven. Their mission: to retrieve the Scriptures from Buddha and deliver them to the Emperor. If they succeed, China will become a happy, prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued. But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils. In the end it takes 14 years; in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent, loyal team, win through dozens of unheard-of threats to life and limb, and achieve enlightenment."
953,0,"This is another long classic in the spirit of ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" that goes on and on with twists and turns that take you by surprise, except for the fact - spoiler alert! - that you know that the four heroes must eventually win through, deliver the Scriptures, and achieve enlightenment. A lot of the Buddhist hierarchy shows up unbidden, or is called upon for help by Monkey as he solves problem after problem on the journey West, so it's an entertaining introduction to those folks. The tone is lighthearted; even the constant threats to the Tang priest's life, as monsters try to capture and eat him (thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh) have a funny side."
954,0,"A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey; he's incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions, even in Heaven; but his heart is usually in the right place. His capabilities are vast, including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic, but his hubris often leads him astray. This is pitched as a children's tale - although the occasional sex and almost constant fairy-tale violence might make it an older children's tale - and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony. It's a fun read, and I was disappointed when it was over."
955,0,I'd recommend it!
956,0,"I currently own 3 different versions of ""Journey to the West"", and of the three, this one is probably the best compromise between detail and brevity. I am currently reading it to my 7-year-old (I read it by myself a while ago), and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch (I have to explain 4 or 5 words on most pages), he's really loving it. The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel, The Wizard of Oz, and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages."
957,0,"I previously read ""Adventures of Monkey King"" (ISBN 0962076511) to my son, and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child, the story was overly abridged, and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost."
958,0,"This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well, but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse, Pigsy, and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire.  As a result, Pigsy and Sandy are a bit under-developed, but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine, and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka, at least.  I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories, because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story (""Journey to the West (4-Volume Boxed Set)"", ISBN 7119016636), and fill in the missing stories if you want to."
959,0,"The way it's told here, the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story.  It's all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda.  In the full-length version, the story is mostly about the journey, and how it changes the characters."
960,0,"This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and ""find out what happens"", but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best, and aren't anxious for it to end.  Be warned, though, the full version can drag a bit if you're hoping to actually see the plot move along."
961,0,"I have heard that the book ""Monkey/Folk Novel of China"" (ISBN 0802130860) best captures the comedic aspects of the story, so that will be my next purchase."
962,0,"The British (well, really, Chinese via Japan) TV series ""Monkey"" is also based on this story. I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia, and that a British release is coming that will include the 13 previously unaired Japanese episodes (with subtitles). As the series was never aired in America, I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it, so that's what I plan to do. The story is that good."
963,0,"This translation skipped most of the adventures along the journey, which were the best part of this classic."
964,0,"Heavily shortened, it's alright overall but leaves a lot out.  Consider it a good primer for readers interested in the whole folklore of this legend, but there are better options out there."
965,0,"I have read the printed version of the ""Journey to the West"" before and thought it would be nice to have the eBook version for my Android.  It's like visiting old friends when I read about the Monkey King, Pigsy and the rest.  Plus, it's nice to be able to bring the book with me so I can read it when traveling or I have a few spare minutes."
966,0,I believe eBooks are definitely the wave of the future and this one makes a nice addition to my electronic library.
967,0,Thanks for reading.
968,0,Brad
969,0,"The book is difficult for most Western readers, because some of the language is so fantastic in its description of all the different spirits, monsters, immortals, etc.  But just stick with it and by the end of the book you will have an increased understanding of the mythology that works its way into a lot of Chinese Cultural opionions."
970,0,"I initially started reading this, because it is one of what is touted as one of the essential Chinese classics, and also because my wife, who is Chinese, was born in the Monkey Year, and I was born in the Boar Year.  The 4 main characters of the novel are Monkey, Pig, Friar Sand and the brother of the Tang Emporer.  My former business partner is named Tang, so, for me the book was irresistable."
971,0,"But, as I said, the book is very long, and the variety of monsters, spirits, immortals, etc. is mind boggling, but somehow, at the end it makes a unified impression, and from reading all the different subplots, you gain an understanding of Chinese culture that simply cannot be gained without it."
972,0,gjmugg
973,0,"tame the ego and magic appears, there are peaceful solutions to anything.  A delightful read of wisdom."
974,0,a wonderfully written book and full of life lessons.
975,0,The Journey to the West is a classic and its great read. Classic Chinese literature is poetic with life lessons all in a great adventure tale. The scene descriptions are hyperbolic but should be read as a tale being told to an audience.
976,0,Real good book I'm keeping it in my libary for good
977,0,"Warning-This documentary will stick with you like biscuits and gravy! It was thoroughly enjoyable. As horsemen, and general lovers of the western lifestyle and landscape this movie was right up our alley. The wonderful mix of youthful ambition and exuberance, combined with gorgeous ever changing scenery and the gritty mustangs who bravely overcome numerous challenges make for some really good watching! There is a little bit of everything in this documentary....joy, sadness, environmental awareness, the plight of the BLM/mustang population, successes, failures and the lost arts of perseverance and grittiness that so many people in todays world seem to lack as they spend their existence bent over a smartphone. Its good to know there's at least a few real cowboys left who have the tenacity to follow through what they start...border to border. The things they have seen, the stories they will have to tell when they are old men on the front porch make me envious. I for one am grateful that they had the adventurous spirit to go on this journey and also to capture that very spirit and convey it to the viewers. Well done."
978,0,"I'm not a big fan of the whole western, horses and cowboys thing. My wife on the other hand grew up riding horses on a ranch. So, over the years, I've seen a fair number of 'westerns' and other media related to horses. And I can appreciate any film that tells a story engagingly."
979,0,"Unbranded had me from the first 30 seconds. The opening moments are one of those 'whoa, holy cow' moments that are shocking, frightening, and so out of the ordinary/expected that your attention is grabbed immediately. But it's not presented in a shlocky manner with 'Psycho' screeching violins - it's a real moment, and it sets the tone for the whole film."
980,0,"The cinematography is first-rate. Honestly, when I heard it was a documentary about some guys riding horses from Mexico to Canada, I was expecting VHS grade video. This is in glorious HD, utterly beautiful. I have no idea how they did it on a Kickstarter budget of $170k."
981,0,"Not five minutes after having finished watching the Amazon rental, we bought it. It's that good."
982,0,"I will say that the ending felt a bit disappointing - the shots break the 180 rule frequently, which makes it a bit confusing sometimes as to whether we're seeing them before or after crossing the border.  And I while I understand Mr. Master's frustration with Jonny's decision - it isn't a failure when someone else's journey departs from one's own expectations - it's their journey to follow, there is no right or wrong. But then - the whole interval was presented honestly, and that's the most important thing."
983,0,"This is a documentary about sixteen wild mustangs, and four young men, fresh-out-of-college with one dream: a once in a life time chance to ride from border to border, 3000 miles starting in Mexico to Canada, up the spine of the American West, with very beautiful scenery. This documentary tracks four buddies that graduated from Texas A & M College. They take on these wild mustangs to be their trusted mounts, and set out on the adventure of a lifetime, what a dream and experience. Their wildness of spirit, in both the man and his horse, is quickly dwarfed by the wilderness they must navigate: a 3000 mile gauntlet that is equally indescribable and unforgiving to no one. I really enjoyed this film, the horses, the men and the beautiful scenery from border to border. If you like cowboys, horses and the great outdoors you will enjoy this film."
984,0,"Unequaled. I rented it on a whim one night. I watched it again, and ended up buying it before I got through it the second time. Touching documentary that portrays both sides of the mustang/rancher saga on federal land while chronicling a once-in-a-lifetime journey between four college buddies.  It's a beautifully crafted film that will bring much-needed awareness to the the BLM mustang adoption program."
985,0,"This documentary on the Mustang horse is so awesome. I have watched this no less than 30 times. What a wonderful story about some friends who take mustangs and travel from Mexico to Canada with these horses. I seriously love this show. Wish my son could have been a part of this journey. What a way to exhibit how the Mustang, when trained properly, can be one of the best horses you will ever own. We bought a mustang 2 yrs ago. And we love her but she has been alot of work. Buy this video and enjoy. It starts out with one of the mustangs gettimg into a cactus and the not so fun job of pulling out the quills. Great great video"
986,0,"A fun film for horse lovers and trail adventurers, though somewhat contrived. The issues and problems of too many horses on BLM lands vs. the concerns of those who believe they should be left alone was poorly presented.  I was left with many unanswered questions, e.g. why not sterilize; what would be the cost of sterilization vs. keeping horses/donkeys in holding pens;  how many of those kept in holding pens are actually adopted; how many of those adopted are 'successful' adoptions for horses that have spent their life roaming free; arguments for/against culling.  As a pragmatic type who has adopted mustangs and donkeys but who understands that the current system is not sustainable, I felt this was a lost opportunity to present both sides of the argument.  Otherwise, definitely worth watching."
987,0,"It is a beautiful movie, with a lot of footage of horses and American land. The beauty alone deserves the 2 stars."
988,0,"Yet, for somebody who loves horses it is a disturbing movie, because the boys don't really seem to care about the horses, but about their own freedom-after-college-before-settling-down adventure and having a good time. Now, there is nothing wrong with having a good time, and their lack of skill as horsemen is understandable."
989,0,"Yet, their lack of care is appalling. Several horses had to pay for that."
990,0,"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this more. I am glad that these guys went through the effort to bring awareness to the wild mustangs that are captured due to overpopulation and who need to be adopted. So...it's definitely for a very worthy cause. That being said, I was personally annoyed by the immaturity of these guys - both with each other and with the horses at times. I feel they could've chosen better routes for the horses so as to not put them through so much physical hardship (mountainous, hilly terrain, etc.). **Pretty sorry of that landowner also that wouldn't let them simply cross through their land.** Also, for much of the film, they didn't really endure nature (or ""rough it"") like I was expecting. They had help driving along with them to supply them with what they needed. I did very much love the sweet older man who helped them. I can't remember his name, but it was enjoyable to have him be part of the crew. So, all in all...it was just OK. Nothing spectacular but I am glad they made the effort to bring awareness to overpopulation issue."
991,0,Enjoyed this movie because I love horses.
992,0,And I especially loved the little burro.
993,0,"Fabulous adventure and nice scenery, especially in Utah."
994,0,The guy I liked the least in this movie?  The person who made the video ... Ben M. was an arrogant control freak.
995,0,He f'd up one of the horses because he wouldn't listen.
996,0,There's a reason why Jonny wanted to finish the last mile ALONE.
997,0,Nuff said!
998,0,I wish I could have went on this journey! The riders take wild mustangs from BLM holding facilities and train them briefly prior to taking a 6 month horseback journey from Mexico to Canada. The movie is largely snippets of their journey trying to condense 6 months into a couple of hours. The adventure this group goes on is one many people dream of. My husband and I both really enjoyed watching this documentary. It is nice to see people working to get mustangs recognized as good equine options. The scenery in the footage is very fun to watch. We both wish we could see more of the footage. It feels like there is so much left to see.
999,0,"This is the first part of a trilogy retelling the story of the Monkey King to be found in the Chinese Classic The Journey West which describes how the Buddhist Scriptures were brought to China starting in due course the Chan version of Buddhism, as the pilgrims face many dangers, demons and hardship. The CGI effects are impressive and whilst it will help to have a better grasp for those who have read the original story, nonetheless an enjoyable."
1000,0,"I have both movies and while parts of this one(very small parts) are sort of old school CGI etc, I love this story and the Monkey King is a great character.  He like any young, he is an arrogant naive know it all,  but you love and eventually he grows up...He also isn't always wrong!"
1001,0,Huge sections are not translated and placed into subtitles. Subtitles are poorly timed. Makes following the story very difficult.

1005,0,"Poorly mastered Blu Ray.  Single audio track marked as ""English"" though it's clearly in a foreign language.  English subtitles are burned into the video instead of an independent SUP or SRT subtitle track, making it impossible to re-position / resize subtitles as needed.  Sound and picture quality questionable at best."
1006,0,This movie was terrific.
1007,0,Read several negative reviews but then they compare it to a western film lacking cool explosions and all the bells and whistles.  This was made in the East so it will be different; that does not make it a bad movie......
1008,0,"This movie is meant to tell a story, a great story at that.  If you're a fan of Eastern movies you will definitely enjoy this movie.  If you want something blowing up every 5 seconds, off the top CGI bullet holes then watch a Western made movie."
1009,0,I got this because it said ENGLISH in language. I got delivery of this and saw the audio is CHINESE.
1010,0,"I watched it after reading reviews here.  It was surprisingly good!  Who wouldn't like the monkey king? The actor did a good job, in fact as noted by others the CGI was ok for the movie, and it was interesting to watch all the actors.  If you like this kind of topic, this movie is pretty fun and I recommend it."
1011,0,"The movie was good but it tended to drag in some places; on the upside, however, they did delve a bit more into the mythology of the Monkey King and how he got punished by Buddha.  In some other movies, like ""Journey to the West"" (which was a really good movie, FYI; I highly recommend it) just tell us the the Monkey King just disagreed with Buddha it gives no more information than that.  So it was nice to see the whole story from the Monkey King's side."
1012,0,They loved it.  It was a gift and then I watched it on Amazon and I loved it as well.  What an incredible movie and the visuals are beyond words.
1013,0,"My husband saw this movie on Amazon and since we like different movies we purchased it, WE loved it.. Even though it has English subtitles … you are able to keep up with the entire movie. We have ordered Monkey King 2 and 3 as well."
1014,0,"I have reached, with sadness, the end of my journey through the four-volume, four-hundred-year-old Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu, then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story."
1015,0,"  It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses. Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love. True, there are dragons and monsters and mythic battles, but of the two main characters, one is an ugly, ultra-violent, supernatural monkey, and the other is a timorous, puritanical monk. Moreover, the narration is less immersed in the characters' viewpoints than I usually prefer, partly because it frequently breaks into poetry. Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic. It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc. While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions, the characters and the situation change slowly, sometimes imperceptibly."
1016,0,"  Any or all of the above might have deterred me. Had I been in a more cantankerous mood, perhaps they would have done so. Yet they did not. By and large, I liked the digressions into poetry. I accepted the cowardice of one character, the violence of the other, the less-than-immersive narration, the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels. I liked the lightness of tone, the sense of fun. Most of all, I grew fond of the characters, as I think the author was fond of them. I wanted to spend time in their company, and am left now, at the end of the long journey, missing them."
1017,0,Purchased the four volumes in the series to read the inspiration behind the countless television shows and films depicting the eponymous Monkey.
1018,0,"Wonderfully written and translated, the text is accessible and easy to read, never descending into dogma or rigid theology. The amount of text is certainly a challenge for the more casual reader though. A prolific introduction by the translator/publisher provides an in depth look at the history of the text, its origins, writing style and other information relevant to the contents, adding another level of understanding."
1019,0,"Surprisingly enjoyable, and certainly entertaining, if the story of WuKong intrigues you, then this translation is a very worthwhile read."
1020,0,This is a translation of classic Chinese Buddhism tales.  The writing appears faithful the style of the Chinese stories and old styles of telling stories.  It is worth reading to get a better understanding of tales virtually every Chinese child learns at an early age.  The whole series helped me in my appreciation of Chinese culture.
1021,0,"A must read book for all avid reader!  So read and buy it or you miss out on a great adventure. Brought all the series of this book title of the same author since I like the ""Journey to the West"" movie a lot (only the movies made in the 1980s and 2014 on youtube) and want to find out how different the movies is from the book.  The book is way different than my favorite J tt W in 1980s movie version for sure, but I still like the book story."
1022,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
1023,0,"Very readable translation. I don't know how accurate it is, the poetry seems to be almost too good, but I really enjoyed it. Those who are not familiar with this style might want to start with The Bandits of the Marsh or Romance of the Three Kingdoms before tackling the 4 volumes of the Journey to the West."
1024,0,"This is the final volume of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  You can feel the long and arduous journey to India coming to an end at last, along with the end of the even longer and harder journey from immaturity to maturity. The point of the Monkey King's very first teacher, ""Nothing in the world is difficult, only the mind makes it so"" comes back to the fore in this brilliant wrap up to a story that has no equal.  If you have been using some visual aids, such as the CCTV production, to help with your comprehension up to this point, my advice is not to use them for the last part of this volume.  The arrival of the group at Vulture Peak and all the incredible human vices, bureaucratic red tape and mistakes that occur from that point on are most impressionable if experienced in the imagination though reading."
1025,0,Fascinating look into the mythology of China.
1026,0,"Hey, this is the ""Journey to the West"". one of the best fantasy adventures of all times.  I wish I had read it as a child, or had it read to me. It was extremely fun and entertaining. This was the first time I had read the novel.  I had seen a few movies that lead up to or were a truncated version of the actual story.  Finally learning who the ""Handsome Monkey King"" was enlightening and aided my comprehension of a Taoist text I had read that discusses the ""monkey mind"" frequently.  While the acknowledged hero in the story is the Buddhist monk who is sent on the journey to the west to retrieve sutras from the Buddha, the real hero is Sun Wukong, the Handsome Monkey King!?! He's the wildest hero I've ever read about.  It takes a while to get the actual journey by all 4 pilgrims but I enjoyed reading how the Sun Wukong became the Monkey King and created such a ruckus in Heaven! Anyone who ever created a comic book or animated superhero must have read or heard of this story and used a variety of Sun Wukong's powers to create their hero.  this will be yet another novel that I'll read at least once per year."
1027,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."

Unforgiven is a modern classic, the 1st Lonesome Dove is great, and I enjoyed Open Range and the Kurt Russell version of Tombstone."
1030,0,"Bone Tomahawk has an A-list cast, the requisite weathered authentic look in both town and people, beautiful filming and dramatic lighting, solid writing, humor, intriguing plot."
1031,0,"But late in the goings there is a scene of complete and utterly depraved brutality which, to be honest, I wish I had not seen, and wish that I could ""unsee"". This graphic butchery never would have been shown if this had been filmed in the 50's, 60's, 70's...probably even up to 2000!"
1032,0,"Now, practically anything goes. Audiences of today seem unbothered by, and perhaps even relish, seeing this brutality. Certainly one can become inured to it; is it possible to become addicted to it?"

1034,0,"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on amazon.  I have to say this really was a movie which told a story (shocking in this day an age) as opposed to most modern movies that use the format to simply dangle sex, explosions and cheap thrills in front of a slack jawed audience.  I don't understand why so many people consider this movie to be slow-paced, as the entire time I was enthralled by the characters' emotions, interactions, and what was an obvious well developed lead up to a shocking and horrible climax.  This movie took the time to actually develop the characters.  Four men go on a long and dangerous journey to rescue a woman and deputy from a clan of cave dwelling natives, knowing that they have little chance to succeed.  On the way they battle the elements in an uncharted and unmapped western frontier and bravely continue through the unforgiving landscape.  The movie contains humor, adventure, drama, romance, and yes, horrific violence for those who are squeamish.  In fact, the scene most reviewers are talking about is pretty difficult to watch and for those of you that have a hard time with that kind of thing should definitely avoid this movie.  But it is certainly horrifying and spine tingling, which is apparently what the director was going for."
1035,0,"An entertaining blend of western and horror, with probably about 80% of the screentime being western, and 20% being horror.  Much of the film feels like a traditional man-on-a-mission western, but the horror scenes, while limited, are quite intense and gory.  The plot is a solid B-movie tale, where an inbred clan of cannibal Indians, feared by the local tribes for centuries, attacks a village and kidnaps a man's wife.  The husband (Wilson), the sheriff (Russell), and old Indian fighter with an axe to grind (Fox), and an elderly deputy (Jenkins) go in pursuit and things get intense.  If you appreciate well-done pulp tales or B-movies, you'll probably like this.  Russell owns the screen as a middle-aged sheriff, the man can act.  Richard Jenkins also does a great job portraying a tired, grieving deputy who only has his job because he's friends with the sheriff, but is willing to do his best at it all-the-same.  The interplay between Jenkins and Russell gives depth to their characters you don't expect in this type of movie.  Wilson did well as a determined husband, though his character was a little one-note.  Fox's character is meant to be somewhat unlikeable, but still has some depth and even a spark of decency to him in the end.  Not a film for the squeamish, but still an entertaining blend of horror and western."
1036,0,"This film is excellent for anyone who grew up with Westerns, but enjoys modern film elements. The majority of the film follows amazing western tropes like a ragtag group of men from different walks of life adventuring together towards a common goal. The dry humor of Westerns is definitely present throughout the entirety of the film with great lines like, ""I am far too vain to ever live as a cripple."""
1037,0,"The other part of the film has an uneasy horror feel that becomes cringeworthy at times. All in all, the film hits all the right notes to be a great western and a great horror film. If one starts this film with the feeling that they are watching a spaghetti western, they will likely not enjoy this film. It does deal with the true terrors of life out in the old west. Fear being a major hurdle for many. As a character says, stupidity of some being the hardest part of living out west. I love the performances of the characters and the little details that drive home the gritty feel of this film."
1038,0,"Saw this movie at the Gateway Theater in Columbus, OH as it is currently in limited release. Huge fan of Kurt Russell and thought this would be a nice segue into ""The Hateful Eight"", his major movie scheduled for release on Christmas day. The poster looks like a cool, little western; doesn't give away much. Boy, was I in for a surprise! It starts out like a traditional Western: some townsfolk are kidnapped by a mysterious band of renegades, and a posse made up of the sheriff, his old deputy, an arrogant, indian-hating aristocratic gunslinger and the husband of the kidnapped woman set out on a rescue mission. Admittedly, the middle 1/3 was a bit slow, but never dragged, using the time to really develop the characters. The dialog was interesting, original and had a rhythm all its own. The 4 main actors were awesome, but Richard Jenkins as the ""back-up"" deputy steals the show, not an easy feat with Kurt Russell at the top of his acting game. And when the rescue party (or what's left of them) finally reaches the caves...well, hang on to your barf bag, cause it'll kick you in the gut. This is the kind of movie rarely seen in American theaters anymore. Well worth seeking out."
1039,0,"Kurt Russell is awesome as small town sheriff.  The whole cast is top notch along with perfect  direction, photography etc.  Only reason this would get ANYTHING LESS than 5 STARS is the fact that it is just too damn scary. You would think that is a good thing,  but this is really sick, scary as hell stuff, trust me.  If you like horror with a twist you will love this.  Seems like Amazon gave the director TOTAL FREEDOM and that is a good thing.  Hollywood always seems to pull back and that never makes for a great film - too scared or worried about $$$ to actually go for it.  This is a great film but, ***BE FOREWARNED*** this to goes very deep into the horror genre.  ***This is not intended for anyone under 15- 17 PERIOD!!!!!***  This is the stuff of nightmares. Hats of to AMAZON for having the BALLS to do this!!!!!!!! But again it is very very hard core graphic horror."

The point that I wish to make is this: McKinley gave Rowan a letter to be delivered to Garcia; Rowan took the letter and did not ask, “Where is he at?” By the Eternal! there is a man whose form should be cast in deathless bronze and the statue placed in every college of the land."

1052,0,"This is not for everyone, but I personally think it was tremendous. It's a western, a comedy, and a monster movie rolled into one. The acting is mostly great, especially Richard Jenkins.  The humor and dialogue are unique and interesting. To enjoy this movie, you need to be mentally prepared for a massive shift in tone at the end. Structurally it reminds me of Dusk til Dawn that way. This seems like a well done western all the way UNTIL... things go horribly wrong. The massive shift from western to... well, horror I guess, really generates a deep sense of how quickly things can go from normal to absolutely horrific. There is no warning or build up, just like real life can be. So much so, you start to wonder ""is this really happening?"" I'm sure this will turn some viewers off, especially if they were enjoying the regular old posse round-em up story. But I think the juxtaposition only drives home how awesome the movie really is. It's a wonderful risk taken by the film makers, turning this movie into anything but the normal Hollywood movie. The first 66% of the movie is necessary though, to connect us to the characters in such a way that we are right there with them at the end. One word of warning: there is one absolutely gruesome and graphic murder later in the film, like nothing I've ever seen. Again, necessary to drive home how real things have suddenly gotten for our heroes. As long as you're mentally prepared for what this movie is like, I think you'll enjoy it."
1053,0,"Bone Tomahawk manages to skirt it's genre schizophrenia by employing the best of every aesthetic.  S. Craig Zahler's warped vision of The Searchers that meets The Road has a self-awareness about it that reveals a sense of pride in not knowing what kind of movie it wants to be. Bone Tomahawk is a rather simple rescue adventure tale that that stays fresh by avoiding the usual bullet-stopped-by-badge clichés and going with nuanced character studies, subtle humor and deft banter. Grizzled sheriff (played by Kurt Russell) recruits a disparate group of men bound by the objective of rescuing a group of villagers abducted by vicious troglodytes. The fact that these savage beings terrorize the town give the film an apocAlyptic tone. As if there is nothing civilized beyond the remote village the characters reside in. Once the four men venture out into the wasteland, a horrific sojourn ensues that gives Deliverance a run for its money."
1054,0,"  Most of the attention given to this movie is over the intense balance of horror and Western, yet the dramatic interaction between the characters is what make it unique. What is so refreshing and lovable about this film is how four men with clashing personalities can come together with such a realistic chemistry.  Every performance in this film is worthy of praise. Russell is his usual one-liner spitting bad ass self ( ""I'll slap you til you turn red"") while his aging sycophantic deputy (brilliantly portrayed by Richard Jenkins) offers rambling diatribes to ease tensions. Alongside them is the sociopathic, trigger happy alpha male John Brooder (Matthew Fox), who kills without remorse or reflection. His presence is offset by the good boy Christian cowboy Arthur, whose wife is among the kidnapped, played by Patrick Wilson. Arthur tries to recalibrate the moral compass after every perilous situation. What makes Wilson's performance especially good is how physically demanding the role is. He spends the entire film disabled and in excruciating pain."

So no kids or faint hearted in the room when this movie is on!"
1057,0,"A worthy follow-up to Steven Chow's 2013 film, this one sticks closer to the Monkey King story and lacks it's predecessor's downbeat ending.  Monk Tang is again the main character in this film, but there's plenty of Sun Wukong action as well.  I was initially thrown off by the re-casting of the roles, but the actors do a great job.  At least the gorgeous She Qi re-prised her role from the first film, if only for a brief cameo.  The combination of writer/producer Steven Chow and writer/director Tsui Hark serves the film well.  There is a lot of imagination and color on the screen at all time, and the film kept my attention at al times.  And they even managed to sneak in the episode with the spider demons, which was the basis for the old Shaw Brothers' Monkey King film ""The Cave of Silken Web!""  Plus, there were plenty of times when I broke out in belly laughs, which I've come to expect from any of Steven Chow's films.  I definitely enjoyed this film more than ""The Monkey King 2"" with Aaron Kwok, which was released around the same time.  I have to state, though, that if you do not have at least a slight familiarity with the Monkey King story you will probably be lost watching this film."
1058,0,"Even as a Chinese viewer, the sequel is never as well made as the initial movie.  Being the second film in the series, the casting changes since the first movie were already irksome, add onto it, the even sillier screenplay (which is saying a lot when contrasted with the silliness preset by the first movie)."
1059,0,Is it a bad movie?  No.

1061,0,Should you be familiar with the tale of Journey to the West?  Most definitely.
1062,0,Otherwise it'll just feel like a special effect filled B-movie :(
1063,0,"Humor, elaborate CGI action scenes, and colorful cast of demons, the 2nd movie in the chow journey to the west series is in many ways what you would expect if you enjoyed the first one.  But while I did enjoy it, I would say its not quite as good as its predecessor.  This is mostly due to scripting, where what proceeds doesn't correlate with what happens next.  There's not much acting in the deception and without spoiling the whole first scene of the movie doesn't make sense in the context of the ending.  Also the first one felt like a movie, and fantastic as the action sequences were, this outing feels more like a filler tv episode than a major arc (plot wise).  I will say I have not read any of journey to the west so it is quite possible this is loyal to the original work so my review will only take the movie as the uncultured american watching it.  Despite my nitpicks everything else that I liked about the first one is in here and with it the move is still quite enjoyable.  The actors really nail the visual comedy providing performances that compliment the colorful and crazy world in which the story takes place.  The Demons have different forms and the movie seems to spare no labor in transitioning them from one to the other as it sees fit.  In the end what few flaws it has are eclipsed by the comedy and the set pieces which make the movie a fun journey indeed."

1091,0,"This is the second volume of Anthony C. Yu's four-volume translation of the Chinese classic, ""The Journey to the West."" As with the first volume, it is quite different than I'd originally anticipated. Far from being a dry, difficult, worthy tome, it is filled with taunts, trickery, battles, monsters, and a generous helping of poetry. The narrative is episodic and repetitive, but connections between the various events help thread it together. I had intended to read a chapter a day, but was often tempted into more. Although there is a great deal of violence, the tone is very light. Suffice it to say, I didn't expect a Chinese classic to contain a scene where three of the heroes pass off their piss as holy water. A radical concept: literature is allowed to be fun."
1092,0,This is a classic series of stories that every child in China knows.  The characters are very popular.  I can now understand some comments made by Chinese speakers and TV news commentators that make allusions to this classic.  This is one of the four volumes translated by the author.  The books are heavily footnoted and suitable for serious study by English speaking persons interested in Chinese culture.  The main issue I have with the series of books is that there is a lot of repetition--based on how the stories were told over the ages.  A minor issue is that many footnotes refer to other volumes--but the Kindle edition does not give an immediate link to the other volumes.

Brought the whole series from this author's since I like the story and wanted to own the entire book collection of Journey to the West.  It is one of the best book I read in my life  and believed me, I read over 2,000 books in 20 yrs.  After reading JW Book 1, I wanted to read the other 3 JW books since I was totally hooked into the story once I read book 1 of JW.  Amazing story telling!"
1094,0,"I have many translations of this Chinese classic, as well as the original Chinese version.  If you want a real feel for this story, you cannot go wrong with this version.  Yes, it is long, but so is the original.  If you are looking for a very condensed, but well done version, I would also recommend the Arthur Waley translation!!"
1095,0,"This is part two of one of the four great written masterpieces of China, beautifully translated by Professor Yu.  It is, I believe, the closest English speakers will get to the original Chinese text.  Occasional awkwardness of wording in the translation is unavoidable as this work has gone from its original to a greatly contrasting culture. Do not let this discourage you as you read, let it instead encourage you to learn to read the Chinese original. Seeing it via one of the many movies / TV productions available is a great help in enjoying this work.  I highly recommend the CCTV production from mainland China done in both 1986 and 2000."
1096,0,"Although the footnotes sometimes get onerous, they really are necessary for a complete understanding of the culture and content behind this book.  I recommend this, and all the other volumes in this series by Mr. Yu, to anyone interested in the culture, history and/or Tao!  Well worth reading."
