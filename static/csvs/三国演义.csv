2,"Though it’s a classic The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is long and slow moving. This version is much shorter and quickly paced. The translation is first rate.

3,"This is the first half of C. H. Brewitt-Taylor's translation of the 14th-century Chinese classic. I am reading his translation in parallel with Moss Roberts's translation. While I am unable to judge the comparative accuracy of the two renditions, as a reader I considerably prefer Roberts's translation, primarily due to his extensive and illuminating endnotes. Lacking the information in those endnotes, I think I would have been unable to appreciate the narrative.  The one respect in which I prefer the Brewitt-Taylor translation is that he inserts paragraph breaks when the text switches from one speaker to another. He also adopts a somewhat more archaic prose style than Roberts does, which may appeal to some readers (though not me) as suggesting the story's venerable age. The original Chinese novel was penned over six hundred years ago, and is based on historical events from about 200 A.D.  I note that I am finding it helpful to read each chapter twice, once in each translation. The book has a vast cast of characters, none of whom I was familiar with before, but many of whom would have been known to its original audience. Reading a chapter again allows me a sense of what it would be like if I wasn't trying to remember who everybody was and which faction they supported. (Although this is slightly undermined by the two translations using different schemes for transliterating Chinese names.)  I will postpone comment on the book's quality as a story until I eventually make my way to the end.  P.S. My rating of 3 out of 5 stars is as much a rating for the translation as for the underlying story, and I may well end up giving the Roberts's translation a higher rating.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804834679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",3
4,"This review doesn't really concern the story - Romance of the Three Kingdoms is justly a classic piece of literature, and it'd be slightly ridiculous to review the story itself on an Amazon review. It's amazing, and exciting, and definitely read it if you can.  What I will review - and what I have significant problems with - is the Tuttle edition for Kindle. I can't really speak on the printed edition, but a lot of my criticisms, I suspect, will apply.  Firstly, there are a ton of typos. I'm averaging one per page now. Things like:  'Today her son is on the throne and all the officials are her friends/ and her influence is enormous.'  It seems petty, and normally I'd ignore it, but it gets on your nerves after a while.  The fact that there are so many of these errors speaks to a lack of proper editing, I think, which leads to my next point: a lot of the prose is pretty bad, stylistically. It varies from place to place, but it's at best annoying and at worst a serious impediment. More than once I've had to stop and ask myself: 'who is the subject of this sentence?' or even 'who is the direct object?' which takes me out of the action while I have to parce the previous paragraph and see who the translator is talking about.  The register of the translation changes as well - one second a character might be speaking in a very formal, periphrastic 'bureaucratese' and then end the sentence with something jarringly vernacular. It seems like a minor issue, but things like that can confuse characterization and are just generally poor usage. More generally, the dialogue is stilted and artificial: 'The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Chien Shih.' Stylistically, it's an awkward sentence - why phrase it like that? It seems pretty obvious that the translator was probably not a native speaker - which is fine, as long as there's a strong editor to clean things up, which seems to be lacking here.  The next one is a bit of a preference thing, I'll admit: usage of Wade-Giles. When I was learning Chinese, Pinyin was the ONLY romanization used. Say what you want about the merits of Wade-Giles, but Pinyin is what people are going to generally be familiar with today. So when I read through this and see (I think) Kongsun Tsan, I have to stop and translate it in my head: 'Kongsun Tsan? Is that Gongsun Zan?' (I've read this book - different editions - a number of times, so I'm familiar with the characters. Otherwise I'd honestly be lost.)  Now I hear what you're saying: 'but what about the people that don't know anything about China? Wade-Giles would be so much simpler. That way people aren't pronouncing Cao as Cow!'  There are a number of other issues in the book that make that a questionable argument. Firstly, WG has its issues here as well - Kongsun's 'Kong' is not pronounced as in King Kong. There are a number of reasons why it would make a bit of obscure linguistic sense to write it that way for romanization purposes, once more to do with consnant voicing, but someone utterly unfamiliar with Chinese would be tripped up by it just as well as they would with Pinyin's c equalling (roughly) [ts]. But this is a huge digression.  For the uninitiated there are somewhat larger issues. Most notably, the usage of ranks. The book is a bit ambivalent about this: when we first meet Guangong, the book notes that this signifies he is Lord Guan (as gong = lord). Other times, however, the book introduces ranks (Chinese ranks) without a single explanation of what it is: 'so-and-so was at the time occupying the rank of ssu-tu.' Well, ok - what is this rank? Where is it on the hierarchy? Is it low or high?  For the record, ssu-tu is situ or 'Minister of Education.' It's worth noting that the edition didn't even get this right: ssu-tu would be si-du in Pinyin, as tu=du and t'u=tu. If you care, the apostrophe (as far as I know) here represents differentiation in consnant voicing.  Why was it necessary to tell us this character was 'ssu-tu' without explaining WHAT it was? (The Minister of Education, an important post, which would help explain why this person was in a position to plan a coup.) The book does this a number of times, which makes the sections revolving around court intrigue especially painful, as we're told person x had position a, person y had position b and person x had position c, with the positions generally not elaborated upon.  The worst part is when the book half does this and half doesn't: 'Commissioner X told Y Ssu-tu [note the Chinese syntax for titles] such-and-such.' Some titles are fully translated and some aren't - so we're hearing Empress Ling tell Tung T'ai-hou (=Dowager Empress) something. It then switches. Overall, INCREDIBLY confusing for a book that has so many important interludes in the highly stratified court.  So we have a confused usage of ranks (some English, some Chinese, some mixed) which at times have no explanation as to what they are or where they are in the court hierarchy. At best, we've been briefed once, and it's NEVER touched again. Why couldn't the translator simply render 'ssu-tu' as Minister of Education throughout the book? What would it have taken away that was more important than clarity?","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804834679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",2

22,"This book is enormous. Two volumes with around 1,400 pages. It is a long saga, an epic some say, in a way a picaresque epic across the whole of China during the Han dynasty of the empire, when that empire was at risk because of internal strife and the incapability of the emperor to keep things under control, by his own fault (the own fault of several emperors one after another) and inability of building some kind of government that could be reliable, transparent and non-corrupted.  And that is where the book is amazingly revealing.  This empire is quite obviously a feudal empire. Power is in the hands of governors appointed by the emperor in each district. The governors are appointed for what these people did for the empire, particularly what they did militarily, and there the difference between serving the empire and serving themselves is not always clear. Ambitious people can climb to the top in no time and then impose their power.  The decomposition of this empire started when the various feudal lords or lordlings started considering the eunuchs, organized in a very close community and clan, who were provided by the emperor with the full control of the government because the emperor is lazy in many ways and looks for an easy way to control such a big empire, and because the emperor is incompetent technically (ignorance of a lot of things necessary for government) and psychologically (unfit to exercise such an enormous power). He then relied on the eunuchs of the empire, a clan of men – and their relatives – who had been castrated for any reason whatsoever, among others to become the top officers of the empire. The most famous eunuch along that line was Admiral Zheng He who had been castrated at an early age because he was a Muslim and he became the top man of the Chinese fleet before it was dismantled by the Confucian Mandarins when they took over around 1430.  These corrupted eunuchs encourage all kinds of outlaws to go around in the country and raid cities and farming areas to their own profit and to the shared profit with local supporters of the eunuchs. A rebellion came from the various local or regional lords who had the power and the means to raise armies. They united and finally succeeded in getting all the eunuchs eliminated and executed, but the main military force was in the hands of an ally of the local and regional lords, an ex-outlaw who shifted from raiding cities and farming communities to raiding the central government by taking control of it. The empire is then at stake because it explodes into rivaling cities and provinces and the central brigand controlling the empire spreads and increases his power by taking control of rebellious provinces.  This is typically feudal. Power is in the hands of the stronger person, of the stronger clan, and stronger means military force and nothing else. Then this power is only a way for those in power to loot the country by levying armed forces and taxes for their own profit. Then the emperor can even be chosen, within the Han line, but for how long? That’s the beginning of the saga but that explains the whole saga: feudalism was the real social and political architecture of the Chinese empire.  The main originality is that there was no spiritual or religious authority of any sort that could set some criteria and norms for everyone and keep the whole empire unified by some kind of spiritual allegiance, unity. That’s the main difference with European feudalism that was entirely controlled and governed by the Catholic church, hence by the Pope and his bishops and cardinals. Nothing like that in the Chinese Empire. So no Peace of God, becoming then Peace of the King in the various kingdoms, a movement that outlawed the use of military force within the limits of each kingdom and also within the limits of Christendom. That explained in part the crusades that started in the 11th century but it also explained the Teutonic crusade against the non-Christian Slavonic people in Poland, Ukraine and what they called Lithuania. War was directed to outside areas, officially non-Christian and to be Christianized. That started quite early after the fall of the Roman Empire and later on the fall of Charlemagne’s empire who only fought against the various Asian tribes or military forces trying to penetrate Europe from the East and against the mostly Muslim Saracens trying to do the same from Spain.  And the emergence of such a spiritual force took a lot of time. The book was written after the takeover of the empire by the Confucian Mandarins and we could wonder if it is not a reflection of this evolution in the 15th century that inspired the author to show how bad it could have been before when the empire’s unity was endangered by internal strife and its unity was rebuilt later on by the leaders of the three kingdoms. We have to think of the other great saga of Chinese literature, “Journey to the West” by Wu Cheng’en, a saga whose earliest extant copy is traced to 1592 and is the story of a Monkey that travels to the west to discover the famous Buddhist scriptures that found the Taoist approach of life that developed in China as the spiritual guideline of the empire and can be considered as the basis of the Confucian Mandarin takeover in the 15th century.  That is rather amazing to see this empire evolving from a purely feudal state with a marginal Taoist presence seen more like some witchcraft than anything else, though they carry the Chinese medical tradition and the ethical code of Taoism, the Chinese version of Buddhism in the making. Their final victory will destroy the Chinese fleet, the most impressive one in the whole world at the time, vastly centered on the China seas and the entire Indian Ocean and that would have been  capable to defend the empire against the European invasion that was still to come when Admiral Zheng He died. The result was a total closing up of the empire onto itself, which enabled the Europeans to come and take control of the whole of the Indian Ocean and then of the China Seas. Closing up on itself made the Chinese Empire weak, particularly the tool of its power was destroyed: the various commercial routes known as the Silk Roads.  You will find all that in these books and it will make clear that the present commercial policy of China to reopen and redevelop the various Silk Roads is the only way for China to develop and recapture its past greatness. Will this policy re-establish some feudal state? Hardly conceivable. Will it establish some hierarchical centralized and unified system in the whole country and beyond? That’s also a dubious unrealistic view. China has to open itself to the world but that will not lead to the looting the English, the French and later on the Japanese tried to impose to China, but it may turn Chinas as the beating heart of the global economy, or at least one of the beating hearts of the global world using its commercial power rather than military force. That should bring you to wondering if the use of military force is not a feudal way of looking at the world and trying to dominate it. You may come to wondering if president Trump’s approach of the world is not a feudal way of looking at the problem in total opposition to and contradiction with the Chinese commercial approach of president Xi.  To conclude I will say that Chinese literature, old or more recent like Lao She’s books and plays, is always centered on this problematic of the whole world in development and the choice between three possibilities: 1- pure military force and a feudal system; 2- pure spiritual closing up onto themselves and their protected own resources: some Confucian hierarchical architecture; 3- a general commercial vision that brings economic development to the world: modern sharing resources via some global free but regulated marketplace.  Just get into this saga and enjoy the action and the treacherous ways of most of these feudal lords.

23,"This is an older translation; sometimes it opts for pseudo-medieval vocabulary, and as many others have noted, it uses the Wade-Giles system of romanizing the Chinese names rather than the pinyin one more often used these days. The newer translation by Moss Roberts probably reads better and has more apparatus, but is not available as an ebook. This ebook does allow one to read the Romance in English on your favorite Kindle platform, but the ebook, like so many of them, is quite badly made. It seems to have been scanned and run through an OCR program but not proofread properly, so that (quite aside from the Chinese names) English words come out misspelled on a regular basis.

25,"The story is truly a classic and the translation is pretty good.  However, the actual product is pretty sloppy.  Volume one was less problematic than volume two, but both had a high number of instances.  The main problem is that letters that are similar in shape, such as b and d, p and g, etc. get switched, almost once a page.  Also, the names weren't proofread very well, as apostrophes get pretty regularly left out.  In a translation system where an apostrophe is the only difference between the names to two characters or places, this becomes a source of confusion.  Also, entire words are left out pretty regularly.  I wonder if any highly fluent English speakers actually got to proofread this, because most of these errors are so obvious.  These errors aren't so bad that it is unreadable, but they really take a person out of the scene while the confusion is dispelled.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804834679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5

I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading, especially those who enjoy historical,cultural, or classical books.  Note: This translation may be somewhat confusing to some people because it uses the more old-fashioned Wade-Giles spellings rather than the more contemporary Pinyin System.  If you were introduced to the Three Kingdoms through the multiple video games that are out,as I was, that use the Pinyin system, it might take a little extra thought on your part to understand who is who as you are reading. For Example, Guan Yu and Cao Cao in Pinyin become Kuan Yü and Ts'ao Ts'ao in Wade-Giles.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804834679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",3
27,"I love the Three Kingdoms. However, having read Brewitt-Taylors masterful exposition, this translation seems lacking, in my opinion.  First, I must confess, I hate the modern Pinyin system of romanization. I cannot abide in a system where letters do not have the proper values. I mean, an entire generation of Americans (and God help the ignorant French!) will pronounce names like Cao Cao as 'Cow Cow', or the Qin dynasty as the 'Kwin' dynasty. The Brewitt-Taylor translation uses the old Wade system, and while it can be hard on the eyes, the reader gets a sense of at least the rough pronunciation (Cao Cao is rendered Ts'ao Ts'ao, Qin is rendered Ch'in, etc).  Also, Brewitt-Taylors translation is nice to listen to. 'Empires wax and wane, states cleave asunder and coalesce'; the sound itself is beautiful, and yet still renders the sense clearly. The Roberts translation certainly succeeds in the latter, but the beauty is lost. However, Brewitt-Taylor requires a very great vocabulary, whereas Roberts is more tame in this regards. Still, this was a book for scholars, and the translation should at least reflect that.  Again, if you have no familiarization with the events of this tale, the complete rainstorm of names is daunting indeed. Always keep in mind the three separate forces (Cao Cao of Wei, Liu Bei of Shu and the Sun family of Wu) as well as a few of the other players (Zhang Jiao of the Yellow Scarves, Dong Zhuo, Lu Bu, Yuan Shao. Liu Biao and Liu Zhang) and you'll do fine. The book itself, in my opinion, is the greatest book ever told, succeeding in being at once a work of strategy, psychology, government, warfare, and human emotion, and there is nothing like it in the lexicon of Western literature.

38,"This movie just doesn't hang together. Andy Lau is solid as Zhao Zilong, and American Maggie Q actually does a really good job as a dark warrior-general. Her Wuxia vibe felt legit to me. As far as the acting itself, the whole cast has it going on.  The problem is with the story that's supposed to be driving the characters. It covers the span of the protagonist's life in a few disjointed chunks. We're never with the characters long enough in one time and place to truly connect. As a result, it's hard to feel the nostalgia that gets poured on thick in the next scene from a decade (or 2) down the road. And not just nostalgia - the film repeatedly prompts us to experience heavy emotions of various sorts, and we'd like to oblige, but the movie hasn't done the developmental legwork to make it happen.  There's lots of martial action, but like the rest of the film, though competent it tends to fall flat. Also, for those who like some eye-candy with their Wuxia, there's very little in that department, as we're on the battlefield in full gear most of the time. A contrived puppy-love story crash lands into the narrative early on, then is just as hastily jettisoned. Maggie Q is kinda sexy in the haughty, shrewd, commanding Warrior Queen way that brings all the Wuxia boys to the yard. But, as with the other characters, the narrative treatment is too abbreviated to fan the flicker to a flame.  It's too bad. It seems there was potential here. But in the end, we're left with not much more than a clunky, uninspiring film.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",3

I'm a midwesterner that really appreciates the alternative view of history and the culture these new movies provide. I also appreciate that the characters are not just 2 dimensional, but are reasonably well developed - whether they're the 'good guys' or the 'bad guys' - and you are able to understand their motivations.  Just 2 minor criticisms.  1.  It takes a little while to figure out the characters initially. 2.

80,"This is easily the most epic, sweeping TV series I've seen.  It's based on a Chinese classic, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which occupies a literary and cultural place in China similar to the Bible in Western Europe in terms of general familiarity with the major stories and sequences contained therein (the 'Zhao Yun Saves The Young Lord' sequence is likely on par with David & Goliath in terms of Chinese familiarity with that sequence and its themes).  The primary characters (and there are literally hundreds of named characters in this story who get screen time) are treated as saints or demons in much of Chinese culture, and seeing this series' take on some of them is refreshing and thought-provoking.  And the traditional 'heroes' of the story (Shu-Han's primaries) are everything one could hope for.  Guan Yu, portrated by Rong Guang, is smaller physically than he's described in the novel or portrayed in the video game series' which use Romance of the Three Kingdoms as source material, but he emotes well and the fight scenes featuring him do a more than convincing job of painting him as the God of War that he's revered to be.  Liu Bei, played by Yu He Wei, is much more conflicted and complex in this series than in other versions of the story, which I think plays extremely well to people already familiar with the story.  Lu Yi shines as Zhuge Liang, stealing every scene he's in just as one would hope.  The Wu officers are also well-presented, with more complexity displayed within Sun Quan's court than in other versions of the story with which I'm familiar.  Lu Su, in particular, shines as a calm, calculating and diplomatic character who serves as a jack-of-all-trades for the Southland.  Zhou Yu is temperamental and well-played as well, and Zhang Bo's Sun Quan also comes across as growing into the role of Wu's primary throughout the series' run.  But the star of the show here is easily Chen Jian Bin's Cao Cao.  Not only is the superb acting of this iconic character memorable, but the re-writing of Cao Cao's story (at least as it's presented from his perspective) was badly needed to add complexity and depth to what is usually nothing more than a one-dimensional villain.  Not only is he a brilliant tactician and politician, but here he's seen in multiple guffaw-inducing (if dark) moments, such as early in the series when he and Chen Gong mistake pig-roasters for assassins.  Another iconic scene is his negotiation scene with Yuan Shao at Guan Du, which he punctuates with a mic drop so epic and so unexpected in its tone and flavor that you'll laugh every time you see it (or even think about it!).  Word of warning: most of the versions of this series I've seen for sale on internet retailers have EXTREMELY poor subtitling.  So unless you're fluent in Chinese, be sure to check the subtitle quality on the specific copy you pick up.  I don't know of any .srt (subtitle files) for this series, though there is a supremely well-subtitled version available elsewhere on streaming sites like YouTube.  But if you can find a copy with quality subtitles, this will be one of the best purchases you'll make this year.  At 95 episodes, each weighing in at 40+ minutes of unique content (the title sequence is 2:30, but worth watching nearly every time), there's enough here to fill up your couch time for the near future.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",5
81,"Please note my review below solely covers the tv series overall and does not includes a review of the quality of subtitles.  In short this is one of the best adaption I seen to date.The acting is superb,in particularly Chen Jian Bin as Cao Cao for which I will discuss later.  The script is well written,and in most part you will feel particularly engaged,whether its political scheming,battle tactics or conversation.The tone ,wordings feel real and not some awkwardly modern script trying to fit to that era.  The tv series is aided by excellent cinematography ,and the battles has a realistic feel and very engaging.I believe they have solid music choices,in which this cant be said to the adaption of Monkey King around this time.  The focus is more on Cao Cao ,which causes some quibbles in some of the forums and blogs reviewers alike.What I understood the concern raised by them is on the portrayal on Cao Cao which is more of anti hero than straight out cunning villain as per portrayed in Romance novel(correct me if I'm wrong) .  Yet I believe Chen,the actor that portrays Cao Cao ,did him justice(in fact he's the star of the whole TV series).In fact in my humble opinion he nails the character entirely .From what I understand,this Cao Cao portrayal is based more on the historical Cao Cao (perhaps not 90% accurate but still) .He portrays Cao Cao with such a complexity of character (master tactician, intelligent, brave, cunning, smooth etc) which is well recorded in history.In fact,if you want to knew Cao Cao more this is a very good adaptation.  How about other characters? I believe that they are solid to very good.For both appearance and acting skills although right now none stick out of my mind other than Cao Cao and another person which I will discuss in spoilers below.  In short,this is an outstanding tv series and you will not disappointed with it especially if you are interested in that era.  If anyone wants a recommendation I will recommend YongZheng empire (and its related series ,KangXi and QianLong empires).Its more on political scheming than wars,yet its no less engaging as this one.Caution must be noted that cinematography it may not be as interesting as this one as it was filmed at least 10-20 years ago.  **Spoilers below**  I believe that the person who potrays Cao Pi ,son of Cao Cao and eventually his successor also did a very good job of him.Cao Pi was heavily vilified in history ,and this series portrayed him in a more positive light.I believed the actor captures the complexity of the character very well.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",5
82,"For anyone who has read the novel 'Romance of the 3 Kingdoms' this is a great adaptation, very close to the source material and even a few things that are left out are generally mentioned in passing. The quality is excellent and this show remains the most expensive show ever made in China. The acting is superb especially the portrayal of Cao Cao, the portrayal is so well done that you will never be able to accept any other actor assigned to this role. Also a great addition is that the names of all the generals are shown when they first appear in each episode, this is really handy considering all the characters. The show starts with the reign of Dong Zhuo and ends after the Sima family usurps the Dynasty. My only slight criticism is that the show does not begin during the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Altogether this is definitely one of the best shows I have ever seen in my entire life. Any fans of the books or video games must see this series.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",5
83,"I'm an American student who studied Chinese in an intensive immersion program a year ago.  In doing so, I quickly realized that it is extremely difficult for most Americans to enjoy Chinese music, and while China has produced some spectacular films, these are few and far between.  However, this tv show single-handedly re-ignited my interest in Chinese culture after Chinese music and movies had me disillusioned.  It is far lower budget than most American tv shows; however, the story line is incredible and the acting is out of this world.  I've spent the past year since looking for another tv series (American or Chinese) to watch, and nothing I've watched since comes even close to measuring up to Three Kingdoms.  It is even better than Game of Thrones despite its MUCH smaller budget.  To be frank, it is astonishing to me that these DVD's are only sold for $70.

84,"Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon brings to the screen the story of a Chinese warrior who enlists in his kingdom's army in order to help bring about peace to his homeland. It's 228 AD and China is divided into three kingdoms warring with one another for total control. The warrior Zhilong, through his superior fighting skills and strategic abilities will rise through the ranks of the army of the Kingdom of Shu and become General in hopes of ending the years of war and division that have decimated the realm.

Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film, which in turn opens a window into the mysterious Orient. The cast have carried out their performances very well, with their great talent and chemistry clearly showing, thus providing for an entertaining film The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all very good.

85,"Review of the Uncut HK version.  Amid the beloved historical epic tales of the 'Battle or Romance of the Three Kingdoms', arose three movies in 2008. The very mediocre 'Empress and the Warriors' with Donnie Yen, and late last year came the first chapter of John Woo's 'Red Cliff'. Daniel Lee's (Dragon Squad) 'Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon' was released a few months earlier in Asia than Woo's star-studded film (which I will review later), and has Hong Kong's Andy Lau (Running on Karma) in the lead as the famous General Zhao Zhilong--yes the same guy in the video game named Zhao Yun in 'Dynasty Warriors'. The film has massive commercial appeal, and the film is beautifully shot. However, purists of the tales of the Three Kingdoms will be annoyed and repulsed, as the film does feel a little empty in regards to an intricate storyline and full of historical inaccuracies. (Hint: John Woo's overly exaggerated film about the three kingdoms isn't much better)  228 A.D, before the rise of the Jin Dynasty. The kingdoms of Shu, Wei and Wu are divided. Zhilong (Andy Lau) is a simple soldier from Changsan who becomes a legendary warrior under the employ of Liu (Yueh Huah) who rises from the ranks of the Shu forces to become one of the 'Five Tiger Generals'. Zhilong becomes famous for his many campaigns against Cao and the last surviving general of the 'Five Tigers'. Now, after many years of war, Zhilong is set to make his last stand against Cho's granddaughter--who has become a beautiful, cold and stoic warrior woman; Cao Ling (Maggie Q, Live Free and Die Hard).  The film is narrated by Pingan (Sammo Hung), Zhilong's oldest friend who joined the Liu army with him many years ago. The film is supposed to cover thirty years, Zhilong was a simple soldier who ascends to become a simple general and so the film feels a little too short. There are a lot of plot holes and several important parts missing, but then as a tale being narrated by Pingan who remained a simple soldier in the ranks, I can accept its shortcomings. Pingan never became a part of Zhilong's military unit until his final campaign. The viewer is privy to Zhilong's achievements through the musings of humble Pingan and it is rather hard for Sammo Hung to carry this burden, and purists will undoubtedly become disconnected. Zhilong is a renowned general in the Shu kingdom, he may be remembered as the 'Spartan' of the Liu army--truly legendary and whose name struck fear in the hearts of his enemies.  Thankfully, Andy Lau does turn in a great performance and I am happy to say he isn't miscast. This may well be his best performance since his role in 'The Warlords' with Jet Li. The plot may be a little too simple and doesn't reach Zhilong's epic grandeur, but Lau does the best of what he's got; Lau is playing a larger-than-life character and despite the simple plot, he manages to project the character competently. Maggie Q. is alluring as Cao Ling, and despite her limited screen time, she was exciting and enchanting to watch. The rest of the supporting cast isn't so bad, but we all have to remember that this is a film with Zhilong as its central focus.  Aside from the Pingan narrations, the real problems begin when the film has some 'add-on' characters played by two lesser known performers in the persona of Vanness Wu, and Andy On; they seem to be mere attempts to give the young stars some exposure. (Maggie Q. is just so hot, I don`t mind her at all)  A lot of folks would be interested to see this film because of  truly iconic characters played by accomplished actors such as Sammo Hung, Yueh Hua, Ti Lung, Chen Zhihui; but sadly the film does nothing with them. Zhilong may be the center of the film but all others, disappear after the first half. This film definitely needed to be longer and the significance of the other four 'Tiger Generals' to Zhilong a little more fleshed out.  The action sequences have the usual style of Chinese epics and reminiscent of other films of this kind. The choreography by Yuen Tak is fairly good, although it looked too flashy for my tastes. (as with Woo's 'Red Cliff') The shots are cool and well-choreographed, a blend of the usual wire-fu, wild slow-mo and blood and some gore. Highlights include Zhilong rescuing Liu's son, (which was fairly exciting) and the fight between Cao Ling and Zhilong were very cool to watch. The fights provide great eye candy, but that's all they were; pure eye candy. The film does have a lot of action, it feels more like an action drama and abandons the contemplative nature of the horrors of war.(although it does touch on this idea a little in the final act) Writer/director Daniel Lee does an average job in mixing in emotions and action, but it felt that it reduced its visceral effect. The film has colorful, elaborate costumes and some beautiful cinematography that it will no doubt attract mainstream audiences.  'Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon' isn't a bad film, and I rather thought that this may be Daniel Lee's best work. It is a lot better than the abysmal 'Empress and the Warriors' and I've seen John Woo's 'Red Cliff' and believe me, Woo's first take on the 'Three Kingdoms' period was better but only by a tad. The lore and legend of the Three Kingdoms isn't fully fleshed out, and the film does resort to flashy camera tricks and choreographed action sequences. While this may not be exactly be a bad thing, and will no doubt give the non-meticulous viewer a good diversion, purists of its historical significance will be very disappointed since it isn`t as intricately compelling as I wished it to be. The film never does delve into wartime strategy that much and falls to the usual epic trappings of honor, betrayal and fate. This film has massive commercial appeal but quite respectable in its quality. 'Three Kingdoms' is indeed an entertaining experience, but not outstanding and manages to exude coolness throughout--but isn't war supposed to be 'un-cool'?  Another one for the overindulgent International audience for beautiful Chinese epics.  Recommended! [3 ½ Stars]","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6",4
86,"There are two things I don't like about this movie.  1.  There are many major details that are not true to history. Fitstly,  Zi Long or Zhao Yun did not die in the battle. He died of old age (1). Secondly, at the battle of Chanban, Liu Bei's wife, Lady Gan was not killed. She's rescued by Zhao Yun.  Thirdly, Zhao Yun never fought with Cao Cao's niece according to history!  You can verify all the details by visiting wikipedia dot org. Sorry, I can't embed the link here. It seems Amazon is blocking that feature. If you find any other reliable website talking about the 3 kingdoms period in China, please put that information here. I'd appreciate that.  2. The acting and directing are not engaging as in other movies of the same genes such as the Warlords. The fighting scenes are so so but they're not good as the ones in the Warlords either.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6",2
87,"If ya ever played the video games: Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the 3 Kingdoms which are based on this China's greatest literary classic from the period epic Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon. You'll be familier with the characters like Lie Bei, his Five Tiger Generals (ÜÕ>') of the Kingdom of Shu: Zhao Yun, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong;& thier enemy Cao Cao & Cao Pi in this film. Though big-budget Chinese epics have become a mighty familiar sight in recent years, the Three Kingdoms era and its fabled lore is rarely tackled in cinema, making this latest blockbuster from Daniel Lee (Dragon Squad, A Fighter's Blues) a groundbreaking effort. and directed by Daniel Lee with a reported budget of US$25 million.The film is one of the two Three Kingdoms-related films in 2008, the other being John Woo's Red Cliff but Deftly hitting screens before John Woo's Three Kingdoms adaptation Red Cliff, Resurrection of the Dragon is based on Luo Guangzhong's 14th-century novel which romanticizes the heroic exploits of Shu King Liu Bei and his larger-than-life generals and advisor. Maintaining his Mandarin period blockbuster streak after A Battle of Wits and The Warlords, Andy Lau stars as legendary general Zhao Zilong (better known as Zhao Yun), immortalized in both Luo's novel and in popular culture as the paragon of courage, charisma, and strength. Starting off as a foot soldier, Zhao rises quickly in the ranks to become the top general under Liu Bei (Ngok Wah). He becomes a living legend in his time with his undefeated record and staggering feats, including single-handedly rescuing Liu's infant son from the grips of Wei King Cao Cao (Damian Lau). Through the many years of war, tides rise and ebb for the Kingdom of Shu and comrades fall one by one, leaving Zhao alone as the invincible general. With his legacy at stake, Zhao leads his final expedition against a Wei army now headed by Cao Cao's granddaughter Cao Ying (Maggie 'Twinkie' Q ). Other than leading man Andy Lau and pan-Asian beauty Maggie Q (Mission: Impossible III), Resurrection of the Dragon features a stunning line-up of veteran actors including some of Hong Kong's greatest stars of yesteryear. Producer Sammo Hung serves as the narrator of the film in the role of Pingan, Zhao's ambitious friend of humble achievements. Damian Lau, Iron Monkey's Yu Rong Guang, and Shaw Brothers heroes Ngok Wah and Ti Lung light up the screen in welcome supporting appearances, while rising action stars Andy On and Vanness Wu lead the way for a new generation. Though it takes some liberal departures from history and the original novel, Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon hits the mark with its epic story, sweeping images, and fierce characterization, gallantly capturing the life and times of Three Kingdoms hero Zhao Zilong. Andy Lau stars as Zhao Zilong, a veteran general of the Kingdom of Shu who took a last stand against the invading forces from the Kingdom of Wei. Maggie Q is the fictional Cao Ying, a grand-daughter of the warlord Cao Cao, whose son Cao Pi became the first emperor of the Kingdom of Wei.The story depicts an alternate history, following the events that unfolded in the Three Kingdoms era through the life of the legendary Shu general Zhao Zilong. Zhao Zilong began his military career as a soldier in Liu Bei's army. Zhao Zilong once displayed his fine spear skills to Liu Bei in a small face-off with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. This impressed Liu Bei, and he decided to promote Zhao Zilong to the rank of a general. Zhao Zilong was bestowed with the 'All Piercing Spear'.Zhao Zilong scored his first victory in battle by outwitting Cao Cao at the Battle of Changban. He managed to rescue Liu Bei's son, A Dou from the clutches of the forces of Cao Cao by fighting them single-handedly. Cao Cao's life was put in great peril and he also lost his personal weapon to Zhao Zilong. Cao Ying, who had witnessed Zhao Zilong's acts, swore to help her grandfather regain his lost pride by capturing Zhao Zilong alive.As history passed, Zhao Zilong had never lost in any battle he fought in, hence earning himself the title of 'The Undefeated General' (íY>'R). Cao Pi forced the last ruling Han emperor to abdicate in his favour and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Kingdom of Wei. Thereafter, Liu Bei assumed the title of Emperor of Shu-Han as a spiritual successor to the fallen Han dynasty by carrying on the family name. Zhao Zilong joined the ranks of Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong to be one of the Five Tiger Generals sworn to defend the Han imperial family. Years after Zhuge Liang's first failed Northern Expedition, he embarked on a second expedition. Zhao Zilong had reached the age of 71 by then, hence Zhuge Liang had doubts about allowing him to join in the expedition. However his persistence ensured him a role in the expedition. The Chancellor handed him two satches, instructing him to open them as per situations. Zhao Zilong set forth on the expedition expecting to achieve a major victory once more. His first feat was the slaying of the four sons of Wei general Han De (similar to the Novel). As Han De retreated, it became obvious that it was a ploy to lure Zhao Zilong into a trap, planned by the Wei commander Cao Ying. Zhao Zilong was forced to retreat to the Yellowbird Peak. It was there where Zhao Zilong pitted his last strength against Cao Ying.In a single one-to-one duel, Zhao Zilong bouted Cao Ying but decided to let her off. During the fight, the undefeated general received a battle scar for the first time ever in his career. The surbordinate generals of Zhao Zilong engaged in a fierce battle with the Wei forces, but were defeated after Cao Ying sacrificed Han De to bring gunpowder into the battlefield. All was lost for Zhao Zilong. He stripped off his armour, picked up his Piercing Spear, and charged towards the Wei forces in a last ditch effort, swearing to defend the Yellowbird Peak, and the dignity of the Kingdom of Shu-Han with the last general and last man.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6",5
88,"Plot seems fractured and it just doesn't flow, probably as it jumps through time too quickly and because of this you cannot get indepth with the characters and story.  Mainly I think this is because the film is too short, it almost needs to be a trilogy!  There is not enough time in the film to get to know all the different characters and feel for them through their struggles.  Even the relationships between the characters during the film are so short it makes their own emotions seem fake.  I really thought it had potential and I got right into it at the start...but once he becomes 'old' it rushes through too much to feel as though you can get indepth in the film on all levels...I felt it just scratches the surface of what seems a wonderful story.  Awesome fight scenes make up for it though and I still enjoyed it, but left wanted more.

89,"This is the best movie I've seen in years! This is definitely a must have for fans of Dynasty Warriors and those who love movies based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Red Cliff). The battles are extremely violent, with a great cinematic flare. Also, there's no flying or dancing on heads in this film. That's something I don't mind in other films, but it credits this movie's excitement without going overboard on the effects. Andy Lau plays the role of Zhao Zilong perfectly, and you'll quickly find yourself in his corner cheering for this Tiger General and his lieutenants. The plot moves at a steady pace, with very little filler material. At the end of the movie, you'll be begging for there to be more!  This DVD is great quality. The subtitles are well done and easy to keep up with. The menus can be a little difficult to navigate (unless you can read traditional Chinese). This feature has everything you'd expect of a big-budget film.

90,"(1.) See 'Red Cliff' series - well, you probably already have so you are aware of the comparison (fair or unfair as it may be). (2.) Great acting and good photography and setting although how a desert water worn gully should figure into this bit of China's history is beyond me. (3.) The isolated small temple with dirt ramp was a bit theatrical and cheap. (4.) The swords and spears and other techy weapons look cutesy-decorative but don't instill much historical confidence in the viewer. (5.) The fighting, blood etc. was pretty typical ho-hum.  There's not much more to the movie as it was not meant to be an historically accurate recreation but an interpretation. Overall: Shallow, disjointed and forgettable.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-English-Subtitled-Daniel/product-reviews/B003AN53S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6",3

The story follows a warrior named Zhao 'Zilong' Yun. The fist half of the movie is decent at best, the action scenes are poorly directed because it's difficult to tell what is going on. The second half of the movie, which completely abandons its historical source and follows some completely made up story where Zhao Zilong fights a fictional female general. The story jumps around from year to years and lacks any real emotional impact. Overall this movie was a horrible experience and a shame to the Three Kingdoms story itself.

The book lists a website that can be used to translate Chinese words.

The Mandate of Heaven in theory was given from heaven to a leader who would act in benevolence and righteousness for the Chinese people, and could be lost by the Emperor who did not display these characteristics.  The book describes in a concise and brief manner the fall of the Han Dynasty, the fighting that gave rise to the three kingdoms, and the final battles that led to the unification of China.

Among many things I liked about the book, is that it detailed not only individual actions (fighting) of key figures but also went into the rationale of their planning and strategy  --  and since many characters are mentioned in the story not all of the strategy had a good ending.  I especially liked they way the story ended each chapter, section with a prelude to what would happen next.  Perhaps this is due to the way the story was originally written  almost serialized.  I found the story relatively easy to read and hard to put down.  If the reader is unfamiliar with Chinese geography,following along on a map might be useful, but then this might not be needed as one could just flow with the story.  I have not read any other translations of this classic so I cannot compare to  other translations.  But I did enjoy this one and will start Vol 2 shortly  I highly recommend this story.

122,"As a teacher for many years I was pleased to find so many literary treasures in Three Kingdoms. A basis of the story is the chance meeting together of the three heroes Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. This happening reminds me that we come onto many good things in life by chance rather than plan. They made a sacred oath of brotherhood. Their loyalty to one another was a joy to read. Their loyalty was tested many times but it endured even in times of great challenge. Their personalities were all quite different from one another however those differences became the strength of their joining together. We all enjoy being individuals and treated as individuals but we all end up belonging to a group whether it is a formal group of some kind or a social alliance. I enjoyed reading about Cao Cao, the nemesis of the three heroes. Cao Cao is a powerful and cunning military leader. We learn that he had his own weaknesses and doubts. The question came to mind many times; what does one do when one has doubts and is afraid of making the wrong choice? He does what we all usually do; we seek out a friend with whom to discuss the situation. We are looking for clarity and some good advice. This is exactly what Cao Cao did and it worked to his advantage.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
123,"Three Kingdoms opened my eyes to give me better insight into events all around me.  Perhaps the most significant episode, for me, was how Cao Cao met the challenge of Yuan Shao. Cao Cao was vastly outnumbered in the confrontation ahead. Two large armies of hundreds of thousands led by Cao Cao and Yuan Shao compete for domination of the empire. The episode in Chapter 18 is so well written that I can feel the trepidation and uncertainty that Cao Cao feels at the moment.  At this movement of Cao Cao's crisis his senior Advisor Guo Jia, comes to him to relieve him of his doubts. This explanation Guo Jia is one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  After the talk together Cao Cao's confidence is restored and he goes on to defeat Yuan Shao's army which is five times the size of is own, WOW!  There are many episodes in Three Kingdoms that stir my understanding and give me hope.  It is a welcome edition to my library.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

126,"This new translation of the Chinese classic Three Kingdoms was awesome to read. It explained how a dedicated group of people could coalesce around an idea with the hopes of having it come true. Liu Bei was definitely an inspired leader. The people who formed his core leadership group each had outstanding traits. I understand better now how an inspired idea can collect followers to try to achieve worthy goals. I also understand better now the importance of wise advice by seeing the impact Zhuge Liang has on events. He thoughtfully considered the details of a situation and then explained to Liu Bei, his leader, how to wisely respond to it in order to achieve worthy results. But without the skillful help of Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun achieving these goals would be impossible. So. It takes three components to achieve success: the worthy idea, good strategy and skillful implementation.   Liu Bei has many challenges to overcome, but this combination of a goal directed idea and good strategy for implementation are the critical components for success. It is rewarding to read how people with helpful aspirations can achieve success through loyalty and dedicated efforts. Though I have only read vol. 1, and part of vol.2,  I am eager to finish reading volumes 2 and 3 to discover how all these events end.   I found the Chinese names to be confusing to follow, but the glossary of main characters listed in the front of the book provided easily found information to help me through the reading of this exciting story.   The innovative use of poetic little poems injected at critical points in the text were unusual but quite pleasing. The author of this book and its translators, Iverson and Yu Sumei, did a fine job producing an awesome book.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

129,"I found this new translation of Three Kingdoms by Ronald Iverson to be a compelling adventure story that was hard to put down. The story was so well written, that I could not stop turning the pages to read on. The dialog flowed so smoothly that I felt compelled to turn the page, page after page, to read on. Though I have traveled to China, I felt the characters come alive in a way I never experienced before. It is now easier for me to understand the culture of China after reading this this new translation, in a way not possible before. This book brought me new insights into the human dramas that have shaped the culture of China. It is no wonder that Three Kingdoms is one of the four classics of Chinese literature. This new translation, in an easy reading version, with complete fidelity to the original Chinese version, will surely give new insights for visitors to China. I liked the short poetic entrees interspersed within the story, which expressed a pithy addition to add interest to the story.  The footnotes at the bottom of the pages were helpful in understanding Chinese terms Westerners are unfamiliar with. The list of main characters listed in front of the book, with brief identity information on each was helpful too, since Chinese names are new to me and sometimes hard to remember. I strongly recommend this new translation to anyone who loves literature or seeks to better understand Chinese culture.

130,"I found the new translation of Three Kingdoms by Ronald Iverson to be an exciting adventure story. It reads like a compelling action novel rather than an historical translation. It reads in easy flowing dialog and narrative that pulls the reader along with exciting action sequences with details that make everything seem real. The fact that Three Kingdoms is a story based on actual facts makes the story especially compelling.  The episodes of loyalty and betrayal, and the actions of ambitious leaders give insight into human nature. Even though the story is about events that happened in China nearly 2,000 years ago, the human interaction seems as real today as then. It is no wonder that Three Kingdoms is one of the four classics of Chinese literature.  The strategies and the competition of wits are marvels of the imagination. I was particularly impressed with the role of Advisors to the Chinese Warlord leaders. Every situation then and now is a composite of conflicting issues. These Advisors would bring clarity to a situation and suggest implementation concepts; sometimes the results were wisely chosen, other times not. As a business man I enjoy reading about how issues can be viewed differently by different people…but the leader has to make his decision between various alternatives and hope for good results.  The appropriate footnotes add meaningful understanding to the story as it unfolds. I am surprised that this important book is not more widely known by Americans. A true Treasure.

131,"It seems there are two things happening at once in this tale of Three Kingdoms; a story within a story. We see both the macrocosm and the microcosm interacting, which reflects the first words of the tale, 'Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span of time. This is the way with things in the world.' One perspective is the overview of the empire itself which seems to be torn apart by rivalries between powerful war lords greedy for more control and power. The empire is seen as a crucible of ingredients heated to high temperature with the expectation that as things cool down and the state of affairs will solidify. The Han Emperor himself is trying to cling to what he has while other forces challenge each other as well as challenge the Emperor. During this period the personalities of the main characters are revealed as they shape the events and are themselves shaped by these events.  It is infinitely fascinating how the character traits of Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Quan, their Advisors and Warriors make dramatic impact on events. The beliefs and deeds of one person makes a difference. Xu Shu's prescient advice to Liu Bei changes the balance of power to enable Liu Bei to challenge Cao Cao's lofty posture which was poised to take over the power of the empire within his hands. Xu Shu devised clever schemes to be employed by Liu Bei to frustrate Cao Cao momentum to rule the empire. In the beginning the power of force shapes events, but cunning strategies soon become the essence of what shapes the political landscape of the empire. The book becomes a kaleidoscope of changing events as wisdom and cunning produce surprise outcomes.  Cao Cao shows himself to be not only a brilliant leader who conceives clever strategies but a leader who recognizes the benefit of listening and heeding the advice of wise advisors like Guo Jia who he gathers around him. Then as the tale develops we see that Advisors wise in the ways of human nature often can predict the actions and reactions of adversaries. Cao Cao and Liu Bei grow in power by listening to their Advisors, while foolish Yuan Shao neglects the wise counsel of his senior advisors and loses not only his kingdom but also his life.  Definitely Three kingdoms is a story within a story, both parts expose the thrill of winning and the distraught trauma of losing. Good reading in this new translation. The footnotes were right there on the bottom of the page when a little extra knowledge helped maintain the steady flow of the story.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5

All of the characters find themselves caught up in unexpected situations where their hopes and dreams are threatened.The most common feature of this book is all the surprises that happen to their plans.I was always compelled to turn the page to find out what was going to happen next.

133,"This new translation of Three Kingdoms presents this epic Chinese classic in a novel way, somewhat different than reading a normal book of a cultural or dramatic nature. On the one hand it is not unlike a Shakespearean tale, a story of great people who collide together as momentuous events unfold.  While the tale is well told in a style of easy yet compelling reading, it has pithy little poems interspersed within the text.  This novel technique is used here in the Three Kingdoms quite effectively.  The translation of the poetry is a delight, capturing the flavor that the original Chinese writing must have contained.  These poems summarize the gist of recent or on-going events.  For example, the story tells of a warrior hero who sees and attacks a wicked enemy of the Emperor, and a poem follows:    'to quell rebellion seize the leader if you can;   A wondrous service waits a wonderful man.'    In another short poem, which conveyed poetically a fresh sense of current events, in this case, the death of a warlord's   senior advisor Guo Jia;    'When Heaven permitted Guo Jia's birth,   It made him ablest man on earth.   Too soon he ran his earthly race,   Too soon the great beam fell from place.'  Another novel and helpful ingredient in this book is its glossary of main characters.  Since Chinese names and places can be confusing to a non-Chinese reader, Iverson's book contains a meaningful glossary of main characters listed conveniently in the front of the book.  Another pleasant surprise are the helpful footnotes at the bottom of the pages.  The story, the style and the quality of the translation definitely make this book worth reading.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
134,"Passion and Charm. This new translation of Three Kingdoms reads like an exciting adventure story. I am glad to see that it is written mainly in well translated dialog rather than narrative. Each chapter has exciting twists and turns leaving the reader curious as to the outcome of events as they transpire. As a person who is interested in the dynamics of human nature, I find the main characters to be charming in the way they deal with one another, showing respect even in competitive events as they ply their strategies to achieve their goals. As I read, I enjoy feeling the passion that motivates the main characters to attempt success. Passion and charm seems to be major ingredients to keep the leaders in positions of leadership. It is interesting to read that these leaders with hero traits can experience stress and disappointment just like anyone else, but they keep trying to achieve their goals even in the face of disappointing situations. I particularly liked when Cao Cao felt apprehensive when he was confronted in an imminent battle by Yuan Shao in Chapter 18 where Cao Cao’s forces were vastly outnumbered. Cao Cao’s brilliant senior advisor, Guo Jia, a master of strategy, explained convincingly the 10 reasons to Cao Cao why he would win the battle due to his military and leadership skills. Two of these 10 reasons of Guo Jia’s which I particularly liked is “He (Yuan Shao) believes that a man is only as good as his reputation, which contrasts with you, who looks beyond this to see what kind of person they really are. This demonstrates that you are a better judge of moral character. He (Yuan Shao) only pays attention to the followers close to him, while your vision is all encompassing.” Guo Jia expresses himself with both passion, charm and insight, which when combined together are powerful human traits. The dialog style of writing gives these ideas more impact than if expressed as narrative. The reader feels the passion not just of 'what' is being done, but 'why'.  All in all, Three Kingdoms is a collection of many literary jewels throughout. These Jewels will surely provide readers not only enjoyable reading but meaningful insight into human behavior as well.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5

138,"Ego and vanity in Three Kingdoms   This translation of Three Kingdoms exceeded my expectations. It reads like an action novel rather than a history book of events that happened 1800 years ago. This translation of this classic of Chinese literature is filled with exciting events of cunning strategies and episodes where the leading characters showed their human vanities and ego not just in matters of military-political control but matters of the heart. I was surprised to read how romantic feelings of these main characters often played a role in the events that played out.   It was compelling to read how carefully planned strategies were frustrated by clever schemes of their adversaries. Cao Cao often relied on military strength to achieve his goals however he met his match with his competition with Zhuge Liang who used wisdom and clever schemes to win the day over and over with exciting surprise tactics. And sometimes it was a woman’s role that changed the course of events which changed the dynamics of the whole situation. Sometimes it involved romance and other times it was a mother whose influence which created an unexpected turn of events which changed the results of plans by the competing forces.   The dialog style of this book makes the stories come alive, pulling the reader into the exciting events. A minimum amount of narrative is just right to give extra impact to the dialog.   The many Chinese names were often hard to follow, but the glossary to main characters with a brief description of their role was very helpful. I would just look to the front of the book to recall the position character held in the story and then continue on with reading.   The footnotes at the bottom of the pages were also quite helpful in understanding the story since many terms and episodes required a brief explanation for clarification.   All in all this Three Kingdoms book has been a great adventure into insights into human nature and Chinese culture.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843937/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5

140,"I've read Moss Roberts' other translations for 'Journey to the West' and 'Outlaws of the Marsh'.  I tried a different translation for 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' done by Brewitt-Talyor as well.  I prefer the Moss Robert's version because: 1. It comes in a 3 volume set (unlike others) 2. It uses the modern pinyin for names vs. Wade-Giles (e.g. Zhang Fe vs. Chang Fei, Cao Cao instead of Ts'ao Ts'ao) which is much easier to follow if you have ever taken a Chinese class 3. There are maps! I got really lost trying to follow-along with the Brewitt-Taylor version  Lastly, Moss Roberts has a copious afterward and amazing footnotes, which aid greatly a western reader who may not have the full context on the non-fiction history of the 3 Kingdoms period.  The 3 classics of Chinese literature are indeed long (about 1000 pages), but so too are series like Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter (where one book is 700 pages), however they are amazing reads.  If you could only pick one, then the Three Kingdoms is IMHO the best of the 3 for a western reader.  If you are going to read all 3, then start with Journey to the West, then go to Outlaws of the Marsh, then to the Three Kingdoms.  FWIW, 3 Kingdoms is packed with adventure, intrigue, tragedy, and also highlights a lot of the virtues of Chinese culture.  Think Game of Thrones in China if you need a metaphor.  I had a hard time putting these books down, and I hope you try them out and enjoy them as well.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

In this particular set the books are small paperbacks with no margins to speak of, small print and annotations in even smaller print. I have to use a magnifying glass to read them. Eventually I bought the 2-volume larger format set put out by University of California Press. The print is larger, but still small -- but at least I can read it without a magnifying glass.Also the margins in the U Cal Press version are wide enough that I can make notes and make cross references for myself.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
142,"Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:  'Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.'  Compare this with Taylor's translation:  'Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity.'  Or Hegel's:  'Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce.'  It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

144,"In AD 235, the ancient world in the West collapsed into chaos when Alexander Severus, Emperor of the Romans, was assassinated and the Roman Empire broke up into three warring states. One included Gaul (modern France), Britain, and Hispania (modern Spain), another Italy and North Africa, and the third was based on Palmyra, ruled by Queen Zenobia. In 270, Aurelian re-united the three kingdoms and re-established the Empire.  It is an odd coincidence of history that at about the same time, the Han Dynasty in China also experienced a revolt (about 190 AD), and it also broke up into the 'Three Kingdoms' of the title. Is there any significance to this parallel? The two empires did have some sort of diplomatic relations, rather astonishing in view of the distances involved. At all events, this sprawling tale is the story of three heroes who swear an oath of loyalty to each other and the Han Emperor at the beginning and try to bring the Empire back together.  For the English-speaking reader the translator has rendered the work into modern, unadorned English. To me the names all seem alike, a problem because there are literally hundreds of characters! However, the authors have given us brave and dedicated heroes as well as a wonderful villain, Cao Cao. He's the kind of man who, hearing someone sharpening a knife in a back room when a guest at an ally's house, breaks into the room and kills the man with the knife. Then he realizes he was just preparing to butcher a pig! He rides away, meets his host coming in the other direction, and decides he'd better kill him and all his escort to keep the error from becoming known. He's the enemy readers can hate with a clear conscience.  The books (5 volumes in paperback) cover a period of several decades with numerous marches, countermarches, sieges, and battles, including the largest naval battle of all time with a total of 800,000 men on 2 fleets of ships and on land. (That's the Battle of Red Hill). While it can be a little tedious because it's so huge, the story keeps your interest and if we could just get a better idea of the geography it could rival the Iliad in Western literature. While there's a map, alas, it is very small scale and the place names in the text far outnumber those on the map.  The historicity of the story has been questioned, with many scholarly arguments over the split between fact and fiction. Apparently the author, who first published it around the year 1500, was a Ming dynasty playwright who supposedly also had access to the Imperial Archives. Some of the characters are real people but it's clear the story has been doctored at numerous points. Also, the Foreword, which is extremely helpful although it's scholarly and not written for the general reader, says that a second author recast the plot around 1540 to strengthen the villainy of Cao Cao, whom the first author wanted to make ambiguous because he was nominally working to prolong the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao works wonderfully as a villain so it's hard to imagine how the original text treated him. So, don't learn your history from this book! It's 'just' entertainment, and however good the Archives were, the authors were working a thousand-plus years after the event. It's not history.  A final layer of confusion is added to the text by the use of the relatively new, People's Republic of China (PRC) official transliteration scheme where Mao Tse-Tung becomes Mao Zhedong and Peking becomes Beijing. Therefore, any familiarity older readers have with China will be almost useless as all the place names and people's names are spelled differently. Of course, literature from a foreign culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet must choose some consistent transliteration scheme, and the PRC one is meant to reproduce more closely the pronunciation used in one of the main dialects of Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin.)  Despite these caveats, 'Three Kingdoms' is a work worthy of your time.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4

The book arrived damaged, because bubble wrap doesn't protect the book. However, they have accepted my complaint, and agreed to a replacement (Thankyou!)  The book itself is a classic, and this is a good translation, although I want the one that starts: 'They say the momentum of history was ever thus: the empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide.' That is surely one of the greatest openings in all of literature; this one isn't quite at that level. I think that version might be adapted from Moss Roberts (the same translator as this book), or it may be his earlier, abridged version.  This is one of the four classical chinese novels, and if you are looking to connect with the Middle Kingdom and its past, this is a great (though rather heavy) place to start.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4
147,"The purpose of my review is not to critique a classic tale, but the quality of this specific collection. You should note that the author, Luo Guanzhong, had a strong bias for Liu Bei's Shu Han, and his account of the Three Kingdoms period is full of embellishment.  Pros: - This translation of Luo Guanzhong's masterpiece is really quite good and at times stunningly beautiful. You'll find yourself rereading passages again and again out of sheer delight. - Each volume contains a marvelous collection of notes that really does illuminate the characters, locations and culture the reader encounters throughout the Three Kingdoms period. The author includes a wonderful introduction and afterword containing a lot of historical information about Luo Guanzhong, the period, and certain key characters like Zhuge Liang.  Cons: The only real issue lies in the quality of the books themselves. - There are many spelling and grammatical errors that just weren't edited out. I've never seen so many mistakes in a book before. - The pages are obviously thinner than western readers are used to, so bath tub readers BEWARE: the pages don't recover from drips, damp fingers, or hot, humid air. That said, as long as you treat them with the care due any book, they'll last just fine.

I won't waste your time in writing a review on the Three Kingdoms - I'm assuming that if you're reading this review, you're already aware of just how important/incredible/enjoyable this novel is.  Truly a great entertaining story and yet so many lessons can be learned from it.  It's no wonder why this is so widely taught in most Asian school systems.  I will, however, comment on this specific 4-volume package.  This is arguably the best packaged-set available (at this time) for those that want to read the novel.  It's not a 'collector's edition' - there's no leather binding or any other high-end detail associated with it, but rather it is a simple and convenient set.  Unlike other versions being sold, it is somewhat smaller (I believe the dimensions are already displayed in the item details) - so it is very convenient to carry around (e.g. read on the subway, train, plane, etc).  It's broken up into 4 volumes (page numbers are continuous - so volume II starts on p597) and the overall quality is actually pretty good.  It's your typical paperback book.  Prior to purchasing, I read a number of reviews complaining of how 'thin the paper was' and that it made it 'completely unreadable.'  I did not find this to be an issue.  Yes, the paper is probably thinner than one would expect... but nothing where it poses a threat of being damaged easily or anything of the sort.  I also didn't find any issues with being able to see the lettering on the subsequent page (as its shadow is visible on the page you're reading).  Yes, it's there and yes, it's noticeable (especially when there a poem - as the poems are indented); but again, I didn't find it to be an issue.  I debated back and forth on what 'version' I wanted to purchase and I can honestly say that I'm quite pleased with this purchase.  It's good quality, it's packaged nicely in a boxed 4-volume set (each volume has notes at the end - so no need to search for notes in another book; as is the case with other versions), it's the unabridged version (a MUST - please avoid any abridged version - as they often leave out so much), and it's affordable (complete set costs as much as one volume of other sets).  It's also a Moss Roberts translation - something I would recommend.  And it also uses the pinyin Chinese translations (more easily pronounceable - in my opinion).  Nice introduction, good notes throughout, etc... so also a great option for those 'studying' the novel.  Simply put, if you're looking for a collector's edition that you're going to hand down from generation to generation with leather binding, hand-drawn images, color, etc, etc... obviously this is not the set for you.  But if you're looking for an affordable, compact, convenient, and accurate translation... then this is the one for you.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
149,"***This review is based on a discovery made when attempting to start reading the book***  The annotations & footnotes for Volume 1 are stored in the back of Volume 2. So if you care about any of these, which there are A TON, you need to buy the second book & lug it around with you. Which these books are not small or light by any means.  No where in the book itself or on this store page does it mention the appendix being in the other volume.

150,"I've heard many stories and references to this book growing up it is kind of nice to actually read them for myself.  Unfortunately I cannot read Chinese at all so I had to rely on finding a translated version.  I came across and attempted a Brewitt-Taylor translation a while back but could not finish the book through that version.  The names of all the people and the way it read did not quite flow as nicely for me.  This version by Robert Moss is fantastic.  It reads nicely and is full of notes and annotations that provide a much deeper understanding of the story, history and of the book itself.  The quality of the books are nice, the text is not to fine or big to read.  I am tempted to now shell out the extra 100 bucks for the hardcover editions.  I was only a bit disappointed the shipping of the product which seemed to damage it some.

151,"I just want to offer my opinion about this edition (the 4 volume box set printed in 1994 [I believe it is 1994]).  The story itself is a fantastic, engaging read.  The language is fluid and I am finding that it is a lot less dry than I expected and so it is very easy to get through the book.  Deciding which edition to purchase was my biggest problem, but so far, I have no issues with this one.  While I read some reviews about spelling errors--and indeed they do exist--they are not at all frequent and detract little from the story.  I also read that the characters names occur in three forms, creating much confusion.  Again, I find this to be untrue.  In fact, the narrative will often clearify who is who for the reader so you are not pondering over names the whole time.  Sometimes a character will be referred to in their style.  I don't know what that means in Chinese (it's probally in the footnotes somewhere), but the style is seperate from the surname and given name.  Most characters styles are never used, except upon introduction, so it's no issue.  My advice to the reader who has never encountered the story (I have played the games and done some preliminary research on the era) is to read up a little on the history of the time.  Start with the end of the Han through the Three Kingdoms period and this will at least give you a foundation for what is going on.  It will also familiarize you with some of the names and the important players who ruled at this time.  The only thing this edition could use are some good maps.  Being that it is a box set, a few seperate inserts that can be referanced along side the books would be great, but they dont have them, so what can you do.  Overall, I am not at all dissapointed and highly recommend the Chinese Classics edition for the serious reader.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4
152,"Ordered these books for my husband - he is into Chinese literature - but I began reading them as well - it was harder for me to follow all the Chinese names because I'm not used to them but once you get past them its like any other story about war and history of wars.  My husband really enjoyed them.  The artwork in the books was enjoyable illustrating what was going on in each chapter and thats something you don't get in modern books so that truly was a plus for these books","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
153,"Right off of the bat, if your only exposure to the Three Kingdoms story is playing the Dynasty Warriors line of video games, this collection might be going right over your head. Especially if you are not a big fan of actually reading. Although there are pictures present, they are few and far between. The bulk of this book is going to be left to your imagination.  In the games the story centers around a select cast of characters, as grand as that amount may be they pale in comparison to the amount of characters that fill this book. You will see so many names flash across your eyes that it will become difficult to tell the difference between a majority of them due to the way the story is told. You don't follow one character from beginning to end like most Western type folklores, here you are looking at the story from the viewpoint of the entire country of China. Good guys and bad guys together, all at the same time.  For me personally, I find it quite refreshing. There are areas where characters are focused upon that I don't favor as much as say Liu Bei, Lu Bu or Cao Cao but I also appreciate the importance they play in the story overall.  Three Kingdoms at it's heart is a story of many men, and the struggle a select few endured in order to become main characters. Any of the no name and less favorable characters could have just a easily become a Cao Cao, or a Sun, but they did not due to their actions and the weaknesses they chose to strengthen.  Overall, this is a great book to hold a mirror up to your own actions and realize that in order to become a main character in the story of our lives, you have to pay attention to what you are doing before challenges arrive. Every little thing you do must be moving you closer to your goal, if not you will easily be swallowed up once you cross paths with someone who has been.  Lead your life through ambitious means, that is the story of the Three Kingdoms.  *Side Note - I deducted a star due to the amount of typos in the book. Other than that, I highly recommend this to any fan of historical literature.'","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4
154,"First of all, this is a classic of Chinese that is relatively unknown in the west.  This epic could be considered the Shakespeare of the Chinese language.  It depicts the decay and collapse of the Han dynasty.  In the process of this decay, the nation is split into three kingdoms which stuggle for supremacy.  In the process of this struggle, we find tales of friendship, heroism, betrayal, and tragedy.  This novel has thousands of characters, but perhaps the main character is Kongming, the military strategist of one of the kingdoms.  It's a pure pleasure to read his elegantly executed strategies.  This translation has a modern feel, so it was easier to read than other translations that I have read.  Robert Moss does a good job of making the story flow.  However, as some other reviewers have said, it doesn't have a poetic feel.  While the story has been translated, it is always difficult to translate literature into other languages.  Having said that, I think this is an excellent translation for those who want an easy read or those who are reading Three Kingdoms for the first time.  Also I strongly recommend an unabridged version, such as this one.  If you read an abridged version, the story won't seem well developed.  The full text is necessary.  I especially recommend this novel for those who are studying politics, military science, or business.  You'll learn lots of strategies for living life.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
155,"Anyone that has played the games or Dynasty Warriors should really read the books. They can be a hard read at times with the names but it is well worth it, i have read them more then once and still i love them. There are SO many stories that the games never touch on that will just amaze you even farther about the beloved characters in the games.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
156,"THE SET:   This is a good set if you simply want a copy of the book. Paperback, and four easy-to-manage volumes.   This is the Moss Roberts translation. So, you'll get the names and spellings you might be more familiar with - like 'Cao Cao' instead of 'Tsao Tsao'.   It's also a good set if you plan on buying other Chinese Classics like 'Outlaws of the Marsh' or 'Journey to the West' because they all have uniform editions.   The only possible negatives are since they are somewhat condensing a really long novel into four thinner volumes, the actual pages seem a little thin. I worry from time to time about ripping them.   There are also a number of typos. But in all honesty, I don't really notice them. With the story moving along so quickly and the presence of already-foreign words and names, a typo now and then won't make you stumble in the least.  THE BOOK:   'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' is a really great (albeit long) story. This is the fictionalized story of a real civil war period in China that occured after the Han dynasty fell. The names, places, and major events were all real. The heroic actions, dialog, and minor events however are mostly imbelished or improvised.   But despite the length and complexity of the story (there are literally hundreds of characters), this book is a GREAT read. Because it has so much content to cover, the book moves at an incredible pace. Characters are literally fighting and/or dying every other page. Although you may get confused by the names, you will not be bored by anything. I often get bored by books, but everytime I pick this one up I am sucked in instantly.   And if you have played any of the Dynasty Warriors or Romance of the Three Kingdoms video games, you should most definitely read the original tale. Plus, you may have a head start on the complexity from knowing some of the characters/events already.   If you're at all interested in ancient warfare, drama, or literature, you need to read this book.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4
157,"This is an awesome set. Complaints about how thin the paper is I find to be unreasonable. The paper is completely adequate - now the New American Bible - that's thin paper. The typos are slightly annoying but not too much of a big deal. The translation I find to be very readable. The material is dense and the footnotes are vital. The amount of information on even a single page is astounding and does not lend itself to a quick or passive read. Anyone who has read more difficult historical works such as Thucydides or Caesar shouldn't have any problem with the style.   Like most I became aware of this story through video games, specifically the Dynasty Warriors games. The games were a good primer for the actual text, as the reader already has mental images of the characters and battles - while the mental images of the characters conjured by the games may not be historical, or accurate, they lend themselves to remembering and differentiating individuals - which can be difficult for western readers because of the Chinese names which naturally seem foreign and hard to remember to westerners. I have always had an easier time with Japanese personal names over Chinese personal names, When you start throwing in X's and Z's in the translated names, my brain just goes 'What? Strange and unfamiliar!' Therefore the primer videogame course helped me immensely.   I do wish the box that holds all 4 volumes was a little more robust, but for the price of the set, I cant really complain. Overall very pleased. Now I need a statue of Lord Guan to start offering incense to the 'God of War.'","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
158,"Now that I finally finished the book, I will say a few words about this book.  It's a long story and it took me over 3 months to finished it.  I did enjoy this historical novel which is said to be 70% based on history and 30% fiction. The characters in the book are more alive in the reader's imagination than in the book itself because there isn't much character developement.  The book doesn't flow or read smoothly instead it feels almost mechanical.  But the events and the actions take a life of it's own in the reader's imagination.  I don't know the Chinese language but maybe there were some essence that was lost in the translation. The events and the strategy that were used in that era of history were brilliant.  Even though this happened hundreds of years ago, I have to remind myself these people were not simple, ignorant farmers.  Instead they were manipulative, calculating and deceptive as much as, if not more than the politicians that we have now. Of all the events in the book, what I still remember is how people are killed so easily and at a whim of those in authority.  No wonder so many people were in fear of their lives and what they said and did because they were at the mercy of the authority.  Another thing I marvelled at was the scale of the wars and battles they had where hundreds of thousands of people would fight and die just because their king wanted ot attack their neighbor. All said, I would reccommend this book for those who have some interest in China or that era of Chinese history.  I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the lack of the character developement which would have made this historical novel much more enjoyable and readable.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4
159,"The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords.  The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all: Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception, and go the obvious route instead.  Basically to sum it up. 1) China splits up into a dozen warring states and warlords. 2) The 'Mandate of Heaven' seems to motivate the warlords to continue fighting, thinking it's heaven's wish to eventually reunite China (which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe, with a dozen states coexisting). 3) The Art of War is known by nearly all the warlords, all the battles are very tactical. 4) If you're interested in Game theory, there are many complicated alliances, breaking of alliances and betrayals between warlords.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5

If you were interested in knowing more than what you did in the video games, then this book is for you. This is an awesome epic novel, sweeping the history of Chinese history. All of the characters that are in the Dynasty Series game are here for our further knowledge. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Lu Bu, Cao Cao, Cao Song, Dio Chan, Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Shiang San..... the list goes on and on. This story written over a thousand years ago, accurately portrays the lives and feelings of these 'heroes'. The author is a little swayed by the Shu family, and he seems to favor them, portraying Guan Yu, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei as the most loyal and honorable sworn brothers, with Cao Cao a sort of evil madman. But that is okay, since I never liked Cao Cao in the game anyway. All in all, this is a long and worthwhile read. I would recommend the unabridged version as it is more complete and thorough. You will not be disapointed to see these wonderful characters come to life.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5

Much as the tales of King Arthur, portray Romanized Britain during the disintegration of Rome, Knightly Brothers strive to preserve the Han Empire or carve kingdoms amidst battles, plots, counter plots, seduction, and betrayal.

I did just the reverse: as a teenager living in France I voraciously read Water Margins, that depicts the lives of 108 outlaws (I knew all of their names by heart!) and is supposed to have a negative influence on young boys because of its vivid display of violence and its apology for the overturn of the social order that made it a favorite of Chairman Mao. The Three Kingdoms was not available in French at that time. I discovered this second classic much later in a Japanese translation, at an age when readers allegedly shouldn't be exposed to its depiction of stratagum, deceptions, frauds and trickeries that cunning politicians could use to their advantage.

171,"After falling in love with the movie “Red Cliff” I discovered that its’ narrative was based on this classic chinese novel. And since this story is so ingrained in the East so as to be part of the culture itself I was determined to ferret out a copy and see for myself.  This is a huge book, it spans generations and took me months to read. My edition was smartly broken up into four books, so I didn’t have to carry around a huge dictionary sized brick, I appreciate that. What I didn’t appreciate was at the end of book four is a list of important characters, their descriptions and even a list of titles with definitions. How is that offensive? Well I sure could have used that while reading books one through three! Being a westerner, I’m just not that comfortable with all of these chinese names and words, some of the characters only differ by ONE letter! Not to mention most of the main characters have more than one name, used interchangeably. There are also a ton of characters, many who will never appear again, for me, someone who is not good at names, this was a bit of a trial.  However, I’m glad I read this, I’m glad I own a copy, and I look forward to reading it again one day. The story itself is impressive with ample amounts of action, tactics, political intrigue, humor, and even romance. I can see why this story has endured for so long.

176,"I'll be perfectly honest: I've never been one to actually sit down and read a book unless it's been marked required reading. In fact, my only fantastic literary claim up to this point was conquering the Harry Potter series. Then, I picked up these volumes. I was absolutely enthralled.  I picked up this book because I'm a big fan of the Dynasty Warriors series. In fact, I just recently discovered that the games themselves were based entirely off of this collection. From then on, I had a blast both playing through the games and reading the books, trying to pick out scenarios and information the game had changed (or in some instances, just completely left out). In the process, I learned something new about ancient Chinese culture and managed to have a fantastic time doing so.  I highly recommend this book. And as many others have said, do NOT buy the abridged version. Spend a little extra and get the four volume set. You'll get a lot more out of the reading.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4",5

Luckily the seller was right on top of it & sent me a new copy of volume 1 with no issues & no headaches. It arrived promptly & in one piece.  The only reason I'm giving the series 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the heavy ghosting with the text in the books. All four volumes seem to suffer from ghosted text & it can get really distracting.

185,"For Americans. Is it the correct translation? No, but that is okay, because a lot of people who buy this book will have done so from exposure to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games from Koei, and they used the Americanized spelling that unfortunately doesn't match up pronunciation wise, but the names are the same as they appear in all the games. I much prefer this, as I bought a copy of the original translation, and had no idea who the hell they were writing about. For those of us who got exposed to this, one of the greatest stories (about 70% true) ever told, having to go back and relearn all the names would be VERY taxing, not to mention annoying as hell.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",5

216,"I first became intrigued with the Three Kingdoms's historical events when I played the game Dynasty Warriors 2 for PS2. Afterwards I was desperately searching to find the best novel translation and finally bought the 4-volume box set translated by Moss Roberts which is the UNABRIDGED version(make sure to get this edition as it tells the whole story w/o leaving anything out).I then set out to explore the 2200+ pages of Chinese history and I must say, it was a fascinating experience. I initially grasped what was going to happen in time but there was so much other details to the story and idealisms portrayed. Leadership, loyalty, heroism, military tactics and warfare, treason, and even romance play such a significant role in this epic novel. 'The empire long united, must divide' and 'the empire long divided, must unite' pretty much opens and closes the novel perfectly. Heroes such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, and Huang Gai portray such loyalty that it would be kind of hard to imagine in today's society. From the other reviews I've read, most people think Liu Bei (Xuande) is the protaganist of the novel and this seems very true since Roberts lauds Bei's characteristics and portrays Cao Cao of the evil and cunning type. Personally, I think anyone can choose their personal protaganist and for me that would be Zhao Yun because of his undisputed bravery and loyalty. Another character that I admired was probably Zhuge Liang for his awe-aspiring military tactics. Zhuge was the best strategist of his time and he wrote several books on warfare but unfortunately, most were destroyed but you can still buy one of his famous books, 'The Art of War.' Warning, spoiler ahead:   This book has its sad moments particularly when someone important or someone who contributed a lot to his lord dies. You'll feel sympathetic towards those who fought hard as well as the ones who died. When the book starts, it's during the impending collapse of the Han then around 220 is when the real three kingdoms come into play: Shu, Wu, and Wei. It's sort of like a battle to the death of who would emerge victorious and indeed there was. Military tactics are exploited on each side and betrayal is widespread. In the end, it would be Sima Yi's family who would unite China under one rule, the Jin Dyansty.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_8?pageNumber=8",5

244,"'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' is possibly the most famous and important novel in classic Chinese literature.  Not only is it the earliest of the 'Four Great Books' (as evidenced by its more archaic language), but it created a complete cultural phenomenon whose impact is still fresh today -- just ask all the young people today who, without having read a word of the book, still know the characters from the strategy and fighting video games released by the company Koei.  And how many literary works can claim to have had a direct impact on history as this book, which was used as a strategy text by the great Manchurian leader Nurhachi and his son Hongtaiji?  I'd read the original archaic text when I was about eight years old, so obviously my views will be heavily slanted by my familiarity with this text.  On approaching this translation, what I find is a well done, respectful and informative translation that doesn't quite nail the tone of the original text, but will be a good read for modern readers who don't read Chinese.  And to be honest, Chinese is extremely hard to translate into English.  Just the fact that subjects, articles and pronouns are often omitted from a sentence is enough to cause nightmares for a Chinese-English translator.  And even by Chinese standards, The Three Kingdoms is a work whose linguistic economy is staggering.  In one page, this book can convey the deaths of half a dozen characters, three to four battles, multiple schemes, and include four or five 'tribute' poems, to boot.  Such is the style of this work, and it could not have been easy for translator Moss Roberts to adapt this style into English.  And he has done the job remarkably, for though I don't think he was able to convey the flavour and rhythm of the original language (the question is, also, whether that would have been possible), his translation makes a good read, and strives to be faithful to the original text, down to the chapter divisions and the inclusion of the 'tribute' poems which frequent the book.  This was an essential piece in the style of the book and I was joyed to see the device retained.  There are instances scattered throughout where I felt the tone of the language may have been misinterpreted, or diluted by the language barrier.  Obviously, I'm not a Chinese professor (as Prof. Roberts is), but as a native speaker, I felt his translations sometimes didn't quite hit the mark.  For example, in the original text, one poem on the character Cao Cao distinctly used a word which meant 'deception' or 'guile', but Prof. Roberts adapted it to 'craft', which dilutes the disapproving tone of the original.  When Yuan Shao refused aid to Liu Bei on account of his son's illness, his advice to the messenger was 'if he is in trouble, he may seek refuge with me', which suggests patronage, not 'find refuge north of the river', which suggests a tactical manoeuvre related to geography.  These are but two examples and you can certainly argue that the meaning of the original text is up for grabs, but as a Chinese native speaker and reader, one who has grown up with this text and re-read the book hundreds of times, I still find the translation a little off.  There is also no attempt at creating period flavour in the language -- the translation is modern, not aiming to add archaic English flavour to try to reflect the age of the original Chinese text.  This may be a good point, however, since the use of archaic English added to the language barrier might have resulted in a book that's very difficult to read.  I think Prof. Roberts sacrificed flavour for clarity, a fair tradeoff to the benefit of the translation.  Again, the question is whether an English translation (or any other translation) could ever be accurate in this way to the original.  Personally, I do think many of the discrepancies in meaning could have been avoided, or ameliorated.  However, as aforementioned, for a reader who's never read the original, this issue won't affect his/her enjoyment of the text.  Just the fact that there is a translation of this extremely important work of Chinese literature is a cause for celebration, and for those people new to this realm, this set of books is a great discovery.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_11?pageNumber=11",4

270,"This review is of Volume 1 the University of California Press edition of the 2-volume paperback unabridged translation by Moss Roberts, ISBN 9780520224780. I've read the translation in a different printing (3-volume hardcover Foreign Languages Press (FLP) edition, published in China), and of course the story and characters are beyond 5-star quality. The Roberts translation has a lot more detail than the newer Yu/Iverson translation published by Tuttle, BTW.  I bought this edition because I'm planning to teach from the first 30-40 chapters of the novel, and I wanted a copy I could both mark up freely, and also assign to any students who will be reading the story in English. So I was quite peeved to see that even though the cover says 'with Notes and an Afterword,' this volume doesn't contain any of the footnotes (endnotes, actually) pertaining to the 70 chapters it holds. UC Press has arranged it so that you have to buy BOTH volumes if you want to get explanations relating to the material in the first volume alone. Surely they could have split the endnotes between the two volumes -- but that wouldn't milk as much money from readers.  Also be aware that this edition is larger in length & width than a usual trade paperback -- it's more like textbook-sized. The font is relatively small, the margins narrow, making the text dense on the page: not at all the 'page-turner' it should be. I strongly recommend the FLP edition: all notes in Volume III, but faster-reading layout of the pages, plus occasional maps and woodcut illustrations (none in this US edition). What a shame that such a great novel and good translation are so poorly -- and exploitatively -- presented.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_14?pageNumber=14",2

272,"It's not that often that I find English translations of Chinese classics that I truly like. Even a very good translation can make you cringe at times because a phrase that's just strange, probably because it's not very translatable. Time to time there are precious gems that really struck me, like Cyril Brich's Peony Pavilion, which I thought truly preserved all the beauty and wit of the original, without being too literal. Moss Roberts's Three Kingdoms is another, but this time maybe not for being a reflection of the original, but for helping me look at the novel with a fresh eye altogether.  First thing first, I am not a big fan of Luo Guanzhong's venerable novel. I admit, it's a good novel from a story telling perspective. There are an insane amount of historical material and legends out there, and it's almost impossible to string together a full story of the Three Kingdoms period, but Luo Guanzhong achieves it. There are many other semi-historical 'romances' out there in China, but with the possible exception of Romance of Sui-Tang (which actually covers a shorter period of time and waaayyyy less material), nothing can equal Luo Guanzhong's work in terms of turning thousands of names into one coherent, captivating story.  Now, my complaints, other than the normal harp about characters being nothing like who they are in history books, lie with the style. Luo's ROTK is probably the first in China's vernacular fiction literature, therefore it is actually a lot less vernacular than all others in the same genre. At the same time, Luo's language is not exactly standard official classical Chinese either. It's this weird combination of classical and vernacular. When compared to Red Chamber, or even Water Margin, Luo's ROTK prose appears extremely terse, dry, borderline boring. When compared back to great works of history such as Shi Ji or Sanguo Zhi or even Tang fictions, Luo's prose lacks that kind of precise elegance and punch of real classical Chinese.  That is why the English translation was actually more enjoyable to read for me than the original. First of all, it's an easire and more fluid read. The style reminded me of Ivanhoe and I thought that was simply brilliant. There is no better style to carry an exotic saga of lords and retainers and battles and strategies. The translator also did not try overmuch to emphasize the oriental exoticism of the story. His translation is very matter-of-fact, and you don't notice the foreignness (probably until a proper name pops up lol), you just notice the fascinating people and events unfolding. Also, an English translation just allows me to look at it with a fresh eye. It lifts the story into a more fictional realm for me, and it's actually more enjoyable that way being more distinctively separated from real history.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_14?pageNumber=14",5

The Beijing edition, the cheap one available here, contains all of the useful footnotes available in the UC Press edition, and relatively few typos.

275,"Robert's translation comes at Three Kingdoms from an academic vantage. His afterword is exception as are his notes very thorough. His prose is exceptionally readable and delightfully entertaining  That said, this edition itself is somewhat frustration to use. All the notes appear at the end of volume 2, meaning you'll need to carry around both books and constantly flip between pages to take advantage of them. If you are interested in the text as an academic work, this is very frustrating; of course if you just want to read, this keeps all the research out of your face. I would have liked to have seen Robert's hard work more prominent in the work--footnotes instead of end notes and more maps and figures.  With that said, this is without question the best translation of the Sangouzhi tongsu yanyi. The question is which version do you want to read. This is probably the best and more affordable option. There is also a cheaper 4-volume paperback and an expensive Chinese-English parallel text version.

279,"This translation of 'Three Kingdoms', one of China's four great classical novels, is extremely accurate and reads excellently and fluently.  Roberts finds a middle ground between fidelity and spirit.  The language used is not archaic, yet the translation is faithful.  It remains one of the best translated texts of Chinese literature ever.  Roberts must be congratulated for translating a book that reads as well as it did in the original written six centuries ago.  Trouble is, the version Roberts translated wasn't, textually, what Luo Guangzhong really wrote.  It was a text embellished by Mao Lun and his son Mao Zonggang at the start of the Qing Dynasty circa 1660, 150 years after the most ancient extant text was established, that of the Jiajing Renwu edition (1522).  The 1522 edition (preface dated 1494) is known as the 'Sanguo Tongsu Yanyi' (abbreviated TS by Roberts).  All credit to Roberts, he discusses, with great scholarly attentiveness, the differences between the 1660s Mao edition and 1522 Jiajing Renwu (Tongsu) edition in an informative afterword.  Roberts said that the differences and literary merits were disputed amongst scholars.  But for people wanting to read a version truer to Luo Guanzhong's vision, the Maos' version is certainly an embellishment, if not an outright revision.  The differences are not minor.  The question we should ask today is, should we be reading the Maos' revision of the original novel in c. 1660, or Luo's own (written around 1400)?  There are people who advocated the Mao version as the superior, more literary edition.  This is no different from scholars who used to 'edit' Shakespeare to make him more palatable to the tastes of their times.  What the Maos did was to add their own judgments to the text.  Luo's TS version of 1522 paints a more accurate historical version of the characters, from the historical annals Sanguo Zhi.  Some people may argue the characters might be drier, but the Maos' changes reflect their own tastes and political allegiances.  The Maos were clearly pro-Liu and anti-Cao.  Cao Cao became Public Enemy No 1, Liu Bei the embodiment of righteous dynastic rule; Guang Yu and Zhuge Liang were deified.  They divided the book into 120 chapters (the TS version was in 24 scrolls and 10 parts each (ie. 240 parts). The Maos changed 10-20% of the text.  The effect is cumulative in such a long work as Three Kingdoms.  The characterizations are changed quite drastically.  To Roberts' credit, he does provide footnotes where the 1660 revised edition differs from the 1522 version.  He is right too that the Maos edition remains the most printed and read version in China, such was its influence.  But to go back to the root of Luo Guanzhong's vision, one must translate the 1522 edition.  Frankly, the 1660s version isn't that bad.  It's an embellished version, more literary, and may suit certain people's tastes better.  For one thing, the line: 'The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide' isn't in the older version.  But since the 1522 edition almost definitely represent Luo's work more faithfully, readers should have their selection.  Since Professor Shen Bojun's magisterial edition of the Jiajing Renwu version appeared nearly two decades ago (which corrects technical errors, ie. errors in dates etc), the task shouldn't be that arduous.  80% of the text is already in the 1660s version.  Voice of hope, however idealistic: give us the Jiajing Renwu version and the Sanguo Zhi (the full historical annals) please, Mr Roberts!","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
280,"Like many other reviewers, the way I first found out about this book was through the Dynasty Warriors video game. I decided to try reading the unabridged version, though somewhat daunted by the size. I did expect the book to be interesting, but I also thought it would be difficult reading. Little did I expect for the book to far exceed my expectations! The Three Kingdoms is a fascinating look into the history (albeit somewhat fictionalized) of China during a roughly 100 year period between 180-280 AD, during which the Han Dynasty fell(the Han was the longest lasting and most powerful dynasty according to the Afterword).  The book is full of stories of honor, courage, and loyalty; as well as betrayal, cowardice, and deception. Three Kingdoms is not just a book about wars, although battle is featured prominently in the book--it spends equal or greater amounts of time peering into the political intrigue, power-struggles, and military strategy. The book is loaded with characters, which presents probably the greatest challenge to a Western reader. Learning the names of the main characters might come easier than you might think, and there is a helpful list of main characters in the back of the fourth volume (though even many of those listed there appear only momentarily in the novel). I would also suggest reading the foreward and at least the beginning of the afterword in the fourth volume before beginning the book--it will give helpful background information.  The storytelling in the Three Kingdoms is so compelling that I often found myself practically cheering for my favorite characters, and often laughing out loud at peculiar victories or witty dialogue. The beginning of the book focuses on Liu Bei (Xuande) a man of admirable character and virtue, but often frustrating leadership. The main body of the book deals with Zhuge Liang (Kongming), who is Liu Bei's military strategist. Kongming is definitely the most fascinating character, and his strategies and manipulation are delightful to watch unfold. The book also has scores of heroes and villains, and gives insight into the values and virtues that were highly regarded by the Chinese. Towards the end of the book the storyline briefly begins to sag as most of the main characters die off, and yet the characters Jiang Wei and Deng Ai redeem the end of the book, and still carry on the suspense and excitement that was stronger and brighter in the first 3/4ths of the novel. All in all I was disappointed when I finished, ONLY because there wasn't more to read! I would definitely read this book again and recommend it to anyone who wants to read a true epic of Chinese history.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
281,"And it's about time too. Moss Roberts does an excellent job of translating the epic novel by Luo Guanzhong in a full, unabridged four book series. Previously I had read an abridged version by the selfsame translator, and while I was impressed with the story, it was too choppy to satisfy me. I later found this unabridged version, purchased it at once and loved every moment of reading. This is it. The definitive 'Three Kingdoms'. 'The Three Kingdoms' is based on the era known as The Three Kingdoms period, or San Guo Yan Yi. This period chronicles the decline of the Han to the rise of the Jin dynasty (circa AD 170-260). The story tells the tale of protagonist Zhuge Liang (referred to as Kongming throughout the story) and his efforts to help his lord Liu Bei (referred to as Xuande throughout the story) unite the land and restore the crumbling Han. You see, Liu Bei is a distant cousin of the child emperor, Liu Xian, who is manipulated by the malicious despot, Cao Cao. Bei, a poor mat weaver, steps up to the plate and helps to put down the Yellow Scarf rebellion under Zhang Jue and the story takes off from there. Zhuge Liang does not actually come into the story until much later and dies in the middle of the fourth volume, but his importance is immeasurable. This story is a must-read for history fans as well as fans of any of the video game series about the time period (Dynasty Warriors, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dynasty Tactics, etc.). Fans of the video game series will love to hear tales of their favorite characters, such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and many more. An important thing to keep in mind when reading Luo Guanzhong's novel is that it is a biased account of the events. Luo Guanzhong is what I call a pro-Shuist, or someone who supports Shu (the kingdom ruled by Liu Bei), so Shu feats may be embellished and fans of the other kingdoms (Wei, Wu) might be frustrated as many of their favorite characters will not be viewed as positively as they may deserve to be. With this in mind, 'The Three Kingdoms' is a fun, if not lengthy, read and will keep you turning the pages. The story isn't terribly difficult to follow but some may have trouble keeping track of the cast of characters (some 600 plus characters in all) and all of their names. What I mean by 'all of their names' is that the chinese had the surname (Zhuge), the given name (Liang) and a style (Kongming). Some officers are called by all three names and it can be difficult to follow. Zhuge Liang is called many things over the course of the novel, in addition to his surname, given name and style, but it shouldn't be to hard to follow. Probably easier then following my explanation of it, at any rate. My major complaint with this edition (and it is minor) is the poor proofreading and the poor quality of the paper and binding. This book was published to Beijing standards and would not meet American standards. You will have to be a little careful with the book while reading it, but that's not too big of a problem. Also, the typos (two or three a chapter) can get annoying and make you wonder who was proofreading the book and make you think that you could do a better job (and you probably could). That aside, this is a very enjoyable story and you will not be disappointed in buying the four-volume unabridged set translated by Moss Roberts.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
282,"One of the greatest of epic novels. I received this book as a gift, and I'll treasure it forever. I know I'll return to it several times in the future to reread it. The book is as long as five novels, but it's more fun than almost any five novels you could choose. The epic sweep through 110 years of Chinese history is amazing. The narrative is swift and compelling. The battles are spectacular and exciting. The characters--especially Kongming, Cao Cao, and Lord Guan--are wonderfully memorable and alive. The English translation, aside from a few typos and misspellings, is good. I don't speak Mandarin, so I wish someone would make a movie version of the story in English, or provide a subtitled version of one of the many Chinese screen adaptations. If I have one problem with the book, it's the character of Xuande. He's weak and indecisive, and lacks the qualities needed in an epic hero. It's hard to see what the other characters saw in him.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
283,"Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a book mixed with both fictional and real life heroes and villains in a time of civil war in ancient China. The video games, TV shows, and movies that are based off of this book have a lot similarities with this book. This book inspired me to learn more about my Asian roots and to major in Asian history.  Many of the events in the book are true, but since the book is historical fiction, some of the events that took place have been altered or never happened.  The same applies with the personalities of many of the characters in the book.  The best thing to do is to read both the factual and the historical versions of Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  Even though I know this to be the case, I enjoy the book overall. The book made me realize that there are heroes and villains in every team and in every force, no matter what side is considered 'a hero' and which side is considered 'a villain.' The book made me realize that love and relationships can have its ups and downs, and the book taught me how different people dealt with stressful situations, ambushes, strategies, and losses of lives.  There is tons of action for action lovers, there is romance, both happy and tragic, for all of the lovers out there that love love stories, and there is tons of information about China that people who are into Chinese and Asian culture can look into. I recommend this book to those that love literature, history, and Chinese culture.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
284,"Like many people I first heard of this novel through the games from Koei. I played romance of the three kingdoms on my Nintendo when I was in high school. A few years ago I started playing the dynasty warriors series of games on the playstation. I had always wanted to read the novel, and I'm glad I did. The story starts around 185 AD, just at the end of the Han dynasty. It continues until the end of the Han dynasty in 220, and finally to the reunification of china around 280. The principle characters are rulers, generals, and politicians that make up the Wu, Wei, and Shu kingdoms. The book is really fast read, considering that the book is 2400+ pages long, it really didn't take that long to read. It is interesting and something is always going on. I don't think I would have enjoyed being a third century Chinese general. They have a pretty short life. It was kind of sad when character that I really like got killed, but considering the time span of the novel it was bound to happen. The novel does focus on the time period from 185-220, after that things start going pretty quick and after 235 AD the story is essentially over, except for a few details. I can't recommend it enough, you could read it 50 times and still get something out of it. If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be one of the books I'd like to have. Now all I need to do is visit china and see some of this stuff from the book","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
285,"[This review is actually for the unabridged Moss Roberts translation] This book lives up to its reputation as a source-book for Chinese adventure, politics, history, culture and just plain swashbuckling fun. For the translator, it is a work of a lifetime - this comes from an amateur sinologist who remains daunted by the original texts of works such as Three Kingdoms. Roberts joins David Hawkes in the all-time Chinese translation hall of fame. For those interested in an introduction to the drama and adventure that provide the framework for Chinese thinking about large issues such as nation-building and nation-destroying, love, honor, war and peace, this is the ultimate guidebook. Long before Gibbon wrote the 'Decline and Fall ...' and Asimov wrote the Foundation series, the Chinese were obsessed with the process of dynastic change and transformation in their own country. It is impossible to overstate the role of this work in Chinese culture -- it is as if everyone in the West actually grew up reading -- and loving -- the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the sweep of history, though, the personal is not lost. Personalities large and small march across the scene and the reader is swept up in their strivings to find a place and something to strive for as the structure of the world turns upside down. For the great Han Dynasty is falling, and no one knows what new configuration will take its place. Military and political geniuses, opportunists, men (and woman, who play a significant role) of cruelty and vision emerge to strive in a chaotic arena, seeking to make their mark on the new order to come. In this sense, Three Kingdoms is a human story which repeats itself again and again, but this is one of the bejewelled versions. Roberts' translation is accompanied by extensive endnotes, which are fascinating to the Sinologist, but which cannot help but distract from the action. Reserve them for later perusal. Finally, the translator has done a tremendous job of translating the poetry in the book - often used to eulogize heroes and martyrs who give their lives out of loyalty to their leaders or who go down fighting in a losing cause. These bits of verse help to cast the necessary sense of the futility of human strivings which pervades this work and the Chinese sensibility generally. The heroes see their own deeds as tiny drops in a great river of history, and their names to be forgotten in years to come. If Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang only knew how Luo and Roberts have extended their memory in times and worlds they could never have imagined.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
286,"Much better than Game of Thrones.  I read this book about ten times now.  I can't get over how good it is.  I've read over ten thousand books in my life time, and I have to say this is probably my favorite out of all of them.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
287,"Last year a friend of mine recommended this masterpiece of Roberts to me to sharpen my English and I found it's a masterwork as excellent as that of the original author about 500 years ago.  It's said that the literature works belong to their own ethnic groups, their languages and can't be translated without losing or adding the meaning. But this epic translated by Roberts completely grasps the meaning of Chinese, both literal meaning, culture meaning and history background meaning of words, not only the surface meaning but also the deep meaning------the meaning in English is just the same as that in Chinese, no more and no less. If a Chinese author translated this middle-ages novel to modern Chinese as Prof. Roberts to modern English, he can do no more and better than Prof. Roberts.  30 years ago as a boy I read this Chinese epic of Luoguan Zhong but ignored the last 15 chapters whose content is about how 'traitor' overwhelmed 'loyalists' and not 'political correct'. But this English version read I from the 1st word to the last word including the annotation which contains many Chinese history events and lores even common Chinese don't know.  The shortcoming of this translation is to non-Chinese readers, especially the English name of the people/place in this history fiction. I think western readers will be easily confused because when 30 years ago I firstly read this book I was also confused except tens of the main roles.  But the translation of title is so cool. ''''(['kau'tsu]the earliest ancestor of this dynasty) and '''''''([tai'tsu'wu'hug'di]the 1st emperor and the founder of this dynasty with many martial merits) is translated to 'Augustus'-------the only and very  correct translation I think. In Chinese books about Julius Caesar Augustus in Rome history, 'Augustus' is simply transliterated to ''''''[au'gu'si'du], because hardly a corresponding ancient Chinese title can be found , ''''''' is the fittest one.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_15?pageNumber=15",5
288,"It's a story of a battle of wits. Military battles are won with trickery and deception, not just with sheer brute force, although force is essential of course. Same is true with diplomacy and politics. In a way it's all like playing chess, and what is chess if not a battle of wits?  The author adopts a style similar to that of ancient Chinese historical records, it's historical fiction after all, with 70% history and 30% fiction. And it's written centuries ago. Therefore it's very different from western novels. Everything is concise, succinct, and to the point. The pacing is lightening fast, and doesn't stop. Don't expect it to burst into a lengthy description of a scenery or somebody's appearance or anything really. Most of the time the reader has to imagine for themselves what everything looks like. If it does touch on a character's appearance, you can bet that character is important later on, which can be difficult to know with the rainstorm of characters introduced.  With such a pace and length, you can already imagine that it covers an enormously long and very complicated plot with hundreds of characters. But the author's brilliance makes it all easy to follow. Character development is skillfully woven into the plot. Every personality is unique and often very interesting. A myriad of the bravest, most capable, shrewdest, most intelligent, or most ambitious people dance across the scene. Countless heroes emerge from all over the land and levels of society to fight for dominance after the fall of Han. Fates change constantly and very fast. After power settles into the three kingdoms, the action does not stop. After all, this tells the story of one of the most unstable periods in Chinese history.  This is the epic that pales all other epics in comparison. If you have the patience to get used to the style and sort out the multitude of names, this can become a fascinating story.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",5
289,"Since I am a novice in the realm of Chinese history, I felt that the abridged version of Romance of the Three Kingdoms would be a better starting point to satiate my appetite that has been whetted by various video games. I find this odd, since I've always lived by the rule of never reading abridged versions, and never buying greatest hits albums. I wouldn't say disappointment settled in, but when reading such a story of chivalry, honor, and valor, you don't want the beautiful writing to end. But then it did. Needless to say, I was left wanting.  Moss Roberts is a poet, no doubt. The language he uses in translation would make this a great work no matter what the age. Essentially, Three Kingdoms is the abridged version of about 90 years of Chinese history chronicling the fall of the Han Empire, the splintering into Three Kingdoms; Wei, Shu, and Wu; and the rise of Wei to prominence. It deals with betrayal, honor, strategy, and respect. And if you can read this, and not have Zhao Zhilong (Yun) be your favorite character, you are a better person than I. His abilities are outstanding.  This is an abridged version (4th time I've said that... Theme?) so you're getting a taste. The original work is 4 volumes and in excess of 2400 pages, this is a hair over 400, so you see what you're getting. I'm about to tackle the original, I've got to get through my Sophocles first, though, and I'll let you know how much better that is. If you're at all interested in Medieval Chinese History, consider this a jumping off point, the chocolaty exterior before the creamy filling.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",4
290,"When I first read Three Kingdoms it was quite a confusing story, what with all the endless characters that came and went, not to mention the impossibility of pronouncing their names properly!  Nonetheless, I was captivated by the quality of the story, despite the very basic narrative style (being hundreds of years old) and the fairly simple way it must have been translated.  With the amount of trials and tribulations that the reader witnesses in following the extremely incredible characters, it is no wonder that these real people from history mean so much to people today, nearly two thousand years later.  Containing personalities of all kinds, Three Kingdoms offers so much wisdom and excitement, that once you get past the first couple of chapters, you are really drawn into a whole new world.  To follow the struggles of men like Guan Yu, Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang as they fight for peace amongst the absolute chaos, gives hope and solutions to any of the problems one can face in today's world.  Yet there are hundreds of characters who fight by their sides in attempts to reunite China, each having their own story to contribute to this immortal saga. It is truly a credit to Luo Guanzhong the way he managed to interweave so many storys, and yet stay prevalently factual.  If you can get past the confusion and the slight redundancy of the narrative style, Three Kingdoms is a story you have to read within your lifetime, and preferably as soon as possible.  According to DW3K.COM, there is a new version of Three Kingdoms that is to be released soon, designed to be more entertaining and less confusing than the 600 year old original. Apparently it will still contain all of the wisdom from Luo Guanzhong's, but will make a much more accessable and hopefully even more enjoyable way to learn about Three Kingdoms.  In the meantime I can also suggest the other 3 chinese classics, in english known as Dream of the Red Chamber/Dreams of Red Mansions(Romance), Monkey King/Journey to the West (Adventure/Fantasy) and Water Margin/Outlaws of the Marsh (Adventure). Each are incredible stories in their own right, and are in many ways equal or even better than Three Kingdoms/Romance of Three Kingdoms.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",5
291,"First off, you have to read the full translation of this book.  I read the 1976 abridged version of Three Kingdoms translated by Moss Roberts first and thought it was pretty good, but felt that the story wasn't developed  enough and lacked cohesion.  Then a few years ago I finally found and  purchased the full unabridged version published by the University of  California Press and also translated by Dr. Roberts.  This is the  full-blown epic from start to finish with all the details and many of the  translation errors of the previous editions eliminated.  The prose was also  improved and flows eloquently throughout the book's entire 3000+ pages.  Three Kingdoms is the tale (part historical, part legend and myth) of the  fall of the Later Han Dynasty of China.  It chronicles the lives of those  feudal lords and their retainers who tried to either replace the empire or  restore it.  While the novel actually follows literally hundreds of  characters, the focus is mainly on the 3 families who would eventually  carve out the 3 kingdoms from the remnants of the Han.  The Liu family in  the Shu kingdom led by Liu Bei, The Cao family in Wei led by Cao Cao, and  the Sun family in Wu eventually led by Sun Quan.  The book deals with the  plots, personal and army battles, intrigues, and struggles of these  families to achieve dominance for almost 100 yrs.  This book also gives you  a sense of the way the Chinese view their history:  cyclical rather than  linear (as in the West).  The first and last lines of the book sum this  view up best: 'The empire long united must divide...' and  'The empire long divided must unite...' If you are at least a  little interested in Chinese history (ancient or modern) and culture this  book is a must read.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",5
292,"I read the 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' for the first time in 1992. I never finished it because the books were so thick. This condensed version is wonderful, because you can read the important sections in the book and finish the book in no time. The translation is also very clear and fluid. It is a pleasure to read this book. On the content, the book outlines the story of the three warring kingdoms at the end of the Han dynasty (about 200 AD). The hero of the novel is Liu Bei, the leader of one of the three kingdoms. The novel is imbued with various elements, such as: heroism, loyalty, history, combat strategies and tactics (which you will marvel on), good (justice) versus evil (tyranny), and even romance. It is an amazing book, which is a must read for all businessmen in the Asian region. The book also include the editor's commentaries at the end that include a discussion on the authenticity and sources of the novel.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",5

294,"Luo Guanzhong and others have contributed one of the most significant true war stories to ever been discovered and documented to date.  Through their findings I have been able to observe how Chinese history was within the years of the Han dynasty, and the costs of war.  From reading this remarkable historical novel, I have discovered a whole new world and have witnessed the costs of war. A world of tragedy, warfare, political and turmoil brought to peace by some of the most intelligent minds and valiant hearts.  The reader first enters the scene at the brewing eye of the storm.  Bandits have begun to break out across the country, causing local lords to rise up in defense of the Han.  Soon, the major characters of the story are revealed, characters of great virtue and grand intentions.  Over the next few years, certain lords gain massive power and begin to stake claims and glory for themselves, totaling disregarding the needs of the failing Han dynasty.  Eventually three specific lords rise up among the others, forming three unique and distinct kingdoms, Shu, Wu, and Wei.  These three kingdoms or dynasties; Shu led by Liu Bei, Wu by Sun Quan, and Wei by Cao Cao, all have certain advantages over the other two.  Varying from wily strategists, massive amounts of manpower, and significant terrain advantages.  Over the course of the next few decades these kingdoms clash for power over China.  Who comes out the victor?  Which Kingdoms rises above the others?  Enter the Three Kingdoms.   Three Kingdoms is truly a book I look forward to reading again.  Among its greatest strengths were the awe-inspiring plot, the well-developed characters and discovering the strategies and tactics of the older times.  I recommend this excellent historical read to any whom have an interest in history, warfare or China.  This is definitely one of the greatest historical novels known to date.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",5
295,"the other reviews probably say enough about the Three Kingdoms for me not to repeat them.  I came to this novel after playing the old Koei games, and I loved reading it. My only problem with the box set is that the books' format seemed very poor to me.  After paying 50 bucks (with shipping), it was a little disappointing to realize I only got three (yes three, though the entire novel was there.  I have no idea why it says '4-Volume Boxed Set') little paperbacks, with a very very small typeset on filmy paper that is very easy to smudge and smear.  Also, there are more typos than there are hairs in Cao Cao's beard.  Distracting. I don't think you should let this deter you from reading the three kingdoms.  But perhaps, if you know you're going to love it, you might want to wait until a much higher class version comes out than the one from the university press I got.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_16?pageNumber=16",4

It is written differently than most American writers' style, which may be weird to somebody that does not realize how authentic the subject and writing actually is. The book is very detailed and for anyone that loves Chinese history of the 150-200 AD period, this book will give you a good description of it.  The characterization and background of the main parties is very in-depth and you get a great idea of the temperaments for all the main characters.  What keeps me from giving this a 5 star rating is that some words are missed due to translation errors, as well as some poor attempts at dramatizing certain moments. Other than those few awkward moments, I am really enjoying the books.

297,"This book is a truly epic tale of ancient civilization. It is a historical fiction of roughly 180-280 AD (the period of the fall of the Han dynasty), with Liu Bei and 'Peach Garden' brothers set as the heros. The plot of this 2000+ page tale centers around the political and military exploits of various leaders of the age. The dissolving the dynastic rule, the rise of warlords, and the subsequent consolidation into three major kingdoms. The story telling is superb, in echoing themes from earlier chapters, and for thematically bonding disparate events and characters. The story also mixes in many different observations into the nature of morality, politics, leadership, and loyalty. This translation seems to be based on the Mao edition, the footnotes are helpful for understanding the historical allusions and identifying where the fiction differs from history.

298,"Four GREAT Chinese classics roam over Chinese Literature, and among those (Romance of the three kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, the Monkey King, and ShueyHudran), Romance of the three kingdoms is deemed as second place, right after the Dream of the Red Chamber. It is a work in the plot of the Three Kingdoms history book, which is written in ancient Chinese and is thus very hard to comprehend. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms however, is a very intriguing accomplishment. However, if one read the translation version, one must bear in mind that there are lots names very similar. I myself have read the Chinese version, which made it much easier to comprehend. The storyline is an adventure, and a great warning to imperialism. The three kingdoms stand in enmity and eventually none of them won. This is the Three-Kingdom tragedy, and the end of the Three-Kingdom dynasty. Lots of symbolism and fables to be interpreted. Very thoughtful and comprehensive, all plot tied up extremely conherently. The characters, as far as I know, are all real. China could not have thrived without the greatness of the Three Kingdoms, for it developed numerous Chinese proverbs, numerous location names, and numerous Gods to be worshiped. It is one of the greatest classics in the world, and it must be savored - every bit of it.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_17?pageNumber=17",5

You can talk about Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and other masters of fantasy novels but unless you read this one, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.

300,"I first became familiar with the Three Kingdoms period through the video game 'Romance VII' (on PS2). Through the game, I was able to understand what each charecter is capable of doing, which illustrated a clear narrative of the basic concepts involved. After playing 'Romance VIII' & 'Romance X', I more or less understood what the novel had to offer. After playing these games, I decided to go to the main source - the novel. While reading the novel, I started associating the images and scenarios from the games with the text. Although you will know how most events will unfold, the endless names, ranks, locations and procedures, will make sense; which without, you will be bored to death. So to sum things up, I highly recommend you play some of the romance games (in particular 'Romance X') so to know how significant some events (like the meeting of the brothers, or the battle with the 'strongest man under heaven') are.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_17?pageNumber=17",5

Even though I am not finished with the three volumes so far it has been excellent and very detailed for an a historical story that happened about two millenia ago.  I am now on the second volume and won't stop till I get to the end. One thing about these books is that it is very difficult readed and not that easy to follow at times because the names of the people can get confusing the chinese has their names, last name first and given names following and also the people in this story sometimes are called by a second name which is common in the chinese culture.  One would have to read these books at least two more times after the first to get the story down because according to my mother my grand father had read the same story in China and told my mom that he had to read it a few times to fully understand this complex time in the history of pre-feudal China and a story still being studied militarily and historically to this day.  In a nutshell dispite the difficult read and complex story which I found to a challenge it is excellent and did not before starting expect it ot be easy, is excellent for someone who wants to be challenged whether or not they have played the game or who just is intrigued by an important time in the history of China.  It is good for people just learning about this country or for some who like me have played the game and is caught by the intriguing story that the game was based on.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_17?pageNumber=17",5
302,"'What of the typos and errors?' whine some reviewers. 'Or the tediousness of the story as a whole?', cry others. One even proposes the introduction of a television show based upon the events of the Three Kingdoms, so as to alleviate the 'dullness' within this epic. So, before I begin my review, I must submit a brief warning:   If you possess the attention span of a five year old, have the vocabulary skills of a newborn (all errors can be corrected mentally, within seconds of their discovery)or prefer movies to books, than this is not for you. Hopefully anyone that suffers from all three ailments has not defiled this book by even considering its purchase. Enough ranting. To the book itself.   This is a passport to the ancient China of lore, where great heroes mingled with Taoist sorcerers, where the pageantry and lavishness of the Emperor's court was matched only by the suffering of the peasants at the other extreme. This is the China of the treacherous yet mighty Lu Bu, the wise Zhuge Liang, and the ambitious Cao Cao. And lastly, this is the China of the Three Kingdoms: Wu, Wei and Shu.   From the rout of the Yellow Scarves in the opening scenes of the novel to the fall of Wu and the unification of the Empire over a hundred years later, this story flows seamlessly, intricately weaving the clash and bloodshed of battle with the scheming and intrigue that fills the tale's early pages. This is a blend of fiction and fact, after all, so Luo Guanzhong does not have the ability to twist the plot in any one direction (though Liu Bei emerges as a hero to Cao Cao's brutal villain)and so some of the lesser fights are told matter-of-factly.   However, there is something about The Three Kingdoms - the Taoist magic, the great warriors, the colorful picture that the author paints of palace life - that keeps it fresh, and wipes away the dryness that fills other legends. While Jiang Wei's endless string of defeats at the end of the novel appears to grow old, it is only because the reader has grown so attached to the Kingdom of Shu that its losses are your losses, and so, when Liu Shan capitulates so suddenly, you are disgusted. But it had to occur, did it not? As promised in the novel's opening line: 'The empire, long united, must divide. The empire long divided, must unite. So it has been...'","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_17?pageNumber=17",5

Even being relatively familiar with the characters and plot, I found the novel to be very difficult to digest, if only because hundreds of characters are introduced (and often killed or left behind) every few pages.  The storyline is vivid and interesting, and this is an excellent novel.  This version is very helpful due to extensive endnotes and a preface and afterword that fleshes out the background and meaning of the novel.  I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in political and military adventures, but you should be prepared to invest substantial amounts of time in reading it.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_17?pageNumber=17",5

307,"It is an excellent novel and the translation is great. When I read the story, I felt like I traveled back to the history, and witnessed the events unfolding in front of my eyes. The story depicts the loyalty, integrity, sacrifice, friendship, betrayal, treachery and human fragiltiy. Today, I can not imagine someone  can match the characters of Lord Guan and zhao Zilong for their loyalty, integrity, courage, and sacrifice. I was also amazed , perhaps, intrigue about the Emperor Xian who somehow could not seek the service from Li Xuande and his people. Perhaps, the Chinese history would have a new twist if Emperor Xian had used Li Xuande to protect the Han dynasty.  Sum it up, the reasons or culprits that led to the collapse of the Han dynasty or any other dynasties later in Chinese history were due a weak ruler, abuses of power from eunichs, or misuse of talents in the court. The irony is nobody could imagine that, in the end, the entire realm was united by Sima Yan to found the Jin  dynasty but not by Cao cao, or Li Xuande or Sun Quan as the three main characters in the story of the three kingdoms that fought against one another.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_17?pageNumber=17",5

The Foreign Language Press published this English translation made by Moss Roberts, in four volumes and 2340 pages, which include many notes, several drawings and some maps. The edition was very carefully done. About the content, I just can say that it is a monumental painting of humanity made through the light of a very difficult time in China history. One hint: at the end of volume four, a list of principal characters is included, which results very useful along the reading.

I bought a set directly from China so I'm not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws.

Thus this, and several other books, are prime for my reading list... but as a general novel I found this book lacking.  This is probably because it is translated but I found this book to be choppy as well as lacking in descriptive writing.  Sword fights between two major figures last for one or two sentences max.  There aren't any vivid descriptions of anything.  I'm not someone who needs two pages describing a flower (the worst case of long unnecessary description I've come across), but I would like to know what a character looks like more than just his height, or what a building or city looks like.  Surely major battles involving thousands shouldn't start and finish in one or two pages.  I suppose that this story could have been twice as long had he allowed descriptions, but I would have enjoyed it a bit more.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_18?pageNumber=18",4

In chinese we called 3 kingdoms as 70% facts, 30% myths.The main character is considered Kongming: --Kongming , a brilliant military leader and politican ,but his talent was exaggerated in the book, in formal history ,his main credit was to save the kingdom of Shu from the Wei's menace. --Sima Yi :this man is a master schemer,a superb politican and military leader.  Sima did not want a total war with the Shu because as long as Kongming ramained a menace to  Wei kingdom , he is  still useful with the Cao's family.And by distinguised himself by battles with Kongming , he gradulally gained control of the Wei ,and finally it was the Sima's family who unitied China and declared themself emperor. --Cao Cao: the Chinese love this man ,his brilliant as well as his ruthless.He was never a king , but one of the most emperor in China's history changed his nickname to Cao Cao , and Mao ZeDong writes poems to praise him. Cao Cao was extremely suspicious :' I would rather betrayed the world than have the world betrayed me'.

Guanzhong based his novel on solid historical facts while adding some fictional elements in order to bring out the characters and events for the reader.

322,"The Three Kingdoms have been, since its creation, the staple of literature in the Orient. It has been translated into Korean, Japanese, and numerous other languages and has been read by scholars, historians, and military strategists everywhere in Northern Asia. However, as anyone who has already read the Three Kingdoms in any of the North Eastern Asian languages will promise, the English version unfortunately does not capture the essence in which the 'Odyssey' of China rose to its widespread fame and ubiquity. It lacks the characterstics that demand to stand as one of the greatest historical and legendary pieces in existence today. That is why it is literature, not simply history. The artistic hand of Luo Guanzhong is almost wiped off and a bland history with awkward word choice is left that leaves little to imagination and wonder.  For people who are interested in the epics of Chinese literature, to gain a simple understanding of the events and perhaps some of the strategies, the book can be recommended. However, to truly appreciate the epic that has created sayings that if you read the story three times, you can be deemed a scholar, the translation simply lacks too much.  It is unfortunately, another case of great literature unable to be shared since it was lost in translation.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_19?pageNumber=19",3

346,"First off, I want to make it clear that I respect the people who love and enjoy this novel. I do not think that their opinion of it is somehow 'wrong.'  The following, however, has been my experience:  Among East Asian classics, and among Chinese classics, this novel is one of the least accessible to the average English-speaking reader. The way in which the story is told is extremely dry and downright baffling to someone schooled in Western literature. The writing had no emotional resonance ever.  The lack of emotional resonance is expected, seeing as there's very little description of anything beside physical occurrences, which are summarized in very succinct form. (i.e. Character 435 stabbed Character 762, then rode to [the city of] JFDFSDG and stabbed Character 953). This sort of sentence compromises the entire book.  Basically, it reads like a reference work. It's not a 'novel' as most western readers would be accustomed to thinking of one. Even if you're open to forms of literature that are drastically different from anything else you've read (as I was, going into this), you'll probably find yourself too exasperated by the novel to finish. It was really a painful experience for me.  However, all is not lost for the person seeking an entry into Chinese literature.  I recommend Dream of the Red Chamber as a good starting novel, especially the translation published by Penguin under the title 'The Story of the Stone' (don't be discouraged by the alternative title, it's the same novel as Dream of the Red Chamber).  Furthermore, Red Chamber was written in the late Qing, which makes it more relevant to the modern history and identity of the region we know as China.  Those looking for older quality pieces of writing from East Asia as a whole may enjoy The Tale of Genji and The Tale of the Heike more than they would enjoy Three Kingdoms. Both 'Genji' and 'Heike' are lengthy novels of Japanese origin, with Genji often being considered the world's first written novel, and certainly the first in East Asia.  To all, Good luck in your readings.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119005901/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_21?pageNumber=21",1

357,"Vol. 2 of 3K touched me in a special way. Vol. 1 was a good appetizer. Vol. 2 is the main course. I enjoyed It especially because it gave me insights into people who I experience in daily life. Liu Bei got his vision of who he was from being a descendant of political leaders. His work experience was only as a maker of straw sandals, but his vision of who he is, is based on his ancestors. To him, this qualified him to be the Emperor of China. We all know that character traits can genetically be passed from one generation to another. Often character traits skip a generation and appear in a second or third generation person. His inheritance opened the doorway to a place of possible political leadership.  Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei's senior Advisor, is the ultimate networker. The fact that he was a person of wisdom enabled him to come up with ideas and schemes. With these qualities he was able, through networking, to be able to overcome great challenges. He was not wealthy nor did he carry a weapon other than his ability to wisely advise. Amazing.  Liu Bei's ultimate challenger, his nemesis, was Cao Cao whose ability was to charge forward with great energy in an aggressive way. Often he seems ruthless in his efforts, but this is the way of the person who obsessively charges onward to achieve his goals.  Sun Quan seems like a person who finds himself promoted into a position that is really beyond his skills and talents. He relies on advisors and skillful supporters to maintain his position.  It is easy to relate these main characters in Three Kingdom to people we meet and deal with today. This book gives me insight into dealing with people I deal with in everyday life.  This version of Three Kingdoms was an easy read. All the Chinese names and places quickly began to confuse me however the list of main characters and who they were listed at the front of the book was a big help in getting through the exciting events written in this book.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Sleeping-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843945/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
358,"A new character was introduced at the conclusion of volume 1 who was to play a critical role in this epic adventure. Serendipity comes to Liu Bei in volume 2 as the new character becomes his advisor. The new character leads Liu Bei to military success over Cao Cao’s forces with clever winning strategies. However, the twist in the plot a few pages later reveals the perils of deceit and cunning to which Cao Cao is capable. Incidents like this seem to mirror real life today; what seems like bad luck actually becomes good luck. In this situation the loss of his wise advisor opens an opportunity for Liu Bei. The advisor, as he is leaving, makes a recommendation to Liu Bei that will change the dynamics of all that has come before. We gather from the sequence of events to follow a whole new range of exciting strategies and episodes, filled with surprises.","https://www.amazon.com/Three-Kingdoms-Sleeping-Translation-Footnotes/product-reviews/0804843945/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

You submerge yourself in these books, and become so immersed in the finely embroidered story that you don't care whether it ever ends. Addictive - I picked it up every chance I got, and even found myself dreaming about the story. Don't try to read these books in a week or two and then move on to something else! You'll shortchange the story and yourself.  Like many Westerners, I suppose, I had some trouble tracking all the names - there are many characters, and some characters have several unique names depending upon what's going on or who is addressing them. But as the story progresses and your familiarity grows, this becomes less of a problem. When I started I kept lists of characters and even made notes amplifying the character's identity and relationships; but this quickly became cumbersome, and in the end I found I didn't need it. You become familiar with the main characters and easily follow their vicissitudes as the story moves along. The story becomes the main thing, and it is great!

You see a statue of Kwan Kung in a lot of Chinese businesses.  He is a red-faced king who carries a long staff with a blade attached that is useful for chopping enemy heads off.  His character is prominent, and his legend is understood by the majority of Han Chinese.  The story centers around the fall of the Han Dynasty, which is considered a 'Golden Age' of Chinese History.  I recommend reading this, just to gain an understanding of the attitudes and point of view of most Chinese.  On the whole, most Chinese are very proud of their history, and most claim that the history is 5,000 years.  Just keep reading, even if you're confused by the names and the discontinuities; by the time you're at the end, it should begin to sink in.  gjmugg","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804834687/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

387,"The second volume of one of the most popular Chinese literature works set in Ancient China during late second to late third century China narrates on what happened to the 3k world years after the Battle of Chibi(Red Cliff) in 208 A.D. In this latter volume, Liu Bei, Sun Quan, and Cao Pi(son of Cao Cao) name themselves as Emperors and China had been divided with Wei(Zao Pi), Shu(Liu Bei), and Wu(Sun Quan). When you read this volume you will find that lots of heroes of previous volume depart the earth such as Guan Yu, Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Zhang Fei. Particularly that of Guan Yu is tragic. On Chapter 106 even Zhuge Liang must face his own death. And that was not the end of the story. Although not as exciting as the days these heroes lived the story goes on until the Shu and Wu are conquered by Jin Dynasty led by Simas.  Note: Tuttle edition uses Wade system which spells differently from current Pin Yin system. Free softwares are available to exchange Pin Yin and Wade but it may take some time to get used to the spelling differences.

401,"Translation: Brewitt-Taylor, 120 chapters, 596186 words (Suggestions for more enjoyable reading are at the bottom of his review.)  I’ve yet to run across another book that has done a better job of integrating combat action, strategy, tactics and politics.  In spite of its length I never got tired of reading it.  It leaves an impression the further you read—as I progressed through the book I noticed that I began to think more strategically--like a chess player.  This is a historical novel, not an authoritative history text.  The history text of this period was RECORDS OF THE THREE KINGDOMS and like many works of fiction based on history, many parts of the ROMANCE can only have been speculation.  Also, skeptics might be unimpressed by the accounts of the supernatural (visions, omens, prophetic dreams (some of them horrible nightmares), miracles, ghosts, etc.)  But the ROMANCE stands on its own as a work of fiction.  And not only do the supernatural events add a dash of spice, they’re also important in illuminating what’s going on underneath the worldly events.  For example, the fantastic account of Daoist magician, Zuo Ci, is probably as close to a peyote vision as most of us will ever get.  But it also presents us the enigma of powerful men.  Cao Cao was a great military leader and political ruler, but Zuo Ci offers him a chance to become a god.  You would think that godhood would be irresistable, but Cao Cao can’t give up his earthly power and his yearning to defeat and dominate other mortals.  In spite of that, powerful men are also hungry for supernatural powers.  They need to see the future and science only takes them so far.  They also have to dabble in religious thinking because everyone down to the humblest peasant takes the mandate of heaven very seriously.  It’s so serious that it starts a civil war in China, possibly the hardest country in the ancient world in which to wage a civil war due to its massive geographic size.  This is also the story of effective military leaders and advanced military technology in the ancient world.  There were great strategists and generals like Cao Cao, Jia Xu, Xu Huang, Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Lu Xun, Sima Yi, Deng Ai and especially Zhuge Liang.  I wish that more of the tactics that were mentioned had been fully described, but there were plenty of details.  For example, The Shu army suffered a major setback because of one bad gully.  Combats involved not only swordsmen but also messengers, logistics, engineers (tunnels, fortifications, moats, mounds, catapults), archers, incendiaries and riverine warfare.  Zhuge Liang even invented some kind of supply railroad, disguised as livestock.  Even tribesmen had metallic carriages.  This is one of the best novels I’ve ever read.  4.6 stars  Suggestions for more enjoyable reading:  1. The first third of the book is essentially background. The story of how the Han dynasty became three separate kingdoms will be told here. The problem for you if you’re a Westerner (like me) is that it is chock full of Chinese names. In the course of the book you’ll become familiar with Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Cao Cao, Sun Quan, Sima Yi and Zhuge Liang. You might want to be aware of great generals and strategists like Cheng Yu, Guo Jia, Jia Xu, Lu Xun and and Xu Huang. But there are hundreds more and they’re not always easy to remember. Therefore, make a “cheat sheet” with what I would consider to be the most important names along with a small bit of biographical information on each.  (Try to limit this information to their rank, skill and who they served--You want to avoid including spoiler data.)  Do this for the names I’ve already mention and add Chen Gong, Cheng Pu, Ding Yuan, Dong Zhuo, Fan Chou, Guo Si, He Jin, Huangfu Song, Jian Shuo, Li Jue, Li Su, Lu Bu, Lu Zhi, Ma Teng, Tao Qian, Wang Lang, Wang Yun, Xun Yu, Yuan Shao, Zhang Ji, Zhang Yang, Zhou Yu and Zhu Jun. You should be able to ignore the rest.  The good news is that, after the background is covered, there won’t be many more names to remember.  2. You’ll enjoy the book much more if you have a set of good maps.  If your edition of the book lacks maps, you can find decent maps on the internet.  I found two or three maps that were useful.  I found the most useful map by googling “Map of the Three Kingdoms” and then downloading the map with the white land mass with the word “WEI” in blue, “SHU” in red and “WU” in green.  The problem is that this map is huge.  What I did was to use my graphics software to cut this map into smaller pieces.  The best idea is to cut them centering on the borders of the kingdoms because that’s where the battles will be.  I printed the JPG as a PDF document.  Then I found an online utility that converted PDF to MOBI format and put the maps on my Kindle (or did I just put the PDF on the Kindle?  Try both to see which works).  It was a bit of a pain to keep leaving the book to look at the maps, but at least I had some sense of where these guys were fighting.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Luo-Guanzhong/product-reviews/1517191270/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5

407,"I've just finished reading the whole book in Chinese for the XXth time. And everytime I read it, I get a different aspect of the book. I was first attracted by the television series on Romance of The Three Kingdoms, and  started to read the book itself, it was fantastic, filled with action and  tactics in military and politics. Then when I re-read the book again and  again, it gave me a deep insight of the cunning of humans, and the  philosophy of the Chinese at that time. But the author Luo Kwang Chung  wasn't being fair to every character. ChaoChau was written as an evil  conspirator and LiuBei was potraited to be a great hero. But was it really  that way? In real history, the time of the Three kingdoms didn't had a  clear distinct between evil and good, but the author wrote it in this way  as in his own sympathy to Liubei, which in ancient China was  more popular  for his loyal to the Han dynasty and sympathy to the peasants. Nevertheless, that's why this is called a historic novel and not  'facts'. So any people reading this book: Read it as a novel and not a  history textbook.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Luo-Guanzhong/product-reviews/1517191270/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
408,"There will always be varying degrees of satisfaction when text is translated; I don't see this book as an exception. I found the book to be very captivating, not poorly-written by any means.  It has it's share of flaws, but only the most discriminating readers will be disturbed by them.  Don't wait for a 'perfect' translation of this great tale to come along; even the most harsh critics of these two volumes will acknowledge that an English translation doesn't get much better than this.  A few errors shouldn't stop anyone from picking up this book. My fascination with this epic tale began with playing the video games.  I eventually discovered this book, and have purchased the VCD movie set since.  I'm glad I read this book before seeing the series.  The series is *superb* to see, but the English subtitles leave much to be desired.  Therefore, I highly recommend this book to anyone who has experienced the series or video games.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves epic, classic literature.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Luo-Guanzhong/product-reviews/1517191270/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4

Please notice that some of the characters don't exist and some  stories in the novel are different from real histroy records. That's why we  call it 'Romance' instead of 'Records'.

421,"Romance of Three Kingdoms is not just the novelized version of the history record 'Three Kingdoms'. It overtook the heart of both Chinese and Japanese. In Japan even younger generation who rarely read literature enjoy the story in the form of either comic books or in popular PC games. In China many of the Chinese Opera comes from the part of this story. The story is based on the history of ancient China around late 2nd century to late 3rd century when the Chinese continent was divided by three strong kingdoms,Shu(Gui in Japanese),Wu(GO in Japanese) and Wei(SHOKU in Japanese). I am familiar with the version of Eiji Yoshikawa, the author of Musashi, focusing more on the story of Liu Pei(Wei emperor),Kuan Yu, Chang Fei, and Chuko Kunming. Liu Pei, an heir of Han Dynasty ruling clan, is a humane leader supported by Kuan Yu, deft both in brain and might maybe eastern version of Knight, Chang Fei,short tempered but really strong warrior, and Chuko Kunming the master of strategy. Rivaling Lie Pei is another giant Tsao Tsao outstanding ruler who nearly took hold of the whole Chinese continent but blocked by the allied forces of Wu and Wei in 208. Tsao Tsao is a bit demonized in this story but he is in fact one of the greatest rulers China ever had comparable to Napoleon. While Lie Pei who has little power gradually gains by charming a lot of talented people by his couteousness yet with propaganda tactics to demonize Tsao Tsao, Tsao Tsao took advantage of courting the Emperor and with the finest staff collected from the whole continent. Tsao Tsao's Shu finally unites the whole China after his death in 265, with the surrender of Wei but Lie Pei, Kuan Yu and Kunming are still loved and idealized by Chinese public. Wu survives by taking either rivaling sides and with excellent domestic and foreign affairs strategy. On first reading you will be enjoying the way the characters outsmart the other camps. On second reading you will be struck by the humanity upon which the story is based. It is much more than a legend. It will surely get you closer to the mind of either Chinese and Japanese. But be careful. The way character name is pronounced differ between Chinese and Japanese. Such as Tsao Tsao is pronounced in Japanese as SOSO.","https://www.amazon.com/Romance-Three-Kingdoms-Kuang-Chung-Lo/product-reviews/0804807264/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
422,"[San Kuo Shih Yen-I] This book has a theme that is so deep that a 1000  years after the Three Kingdoms period ended the book was written. From  189AD to about 300AD, the state of China was in turmoil. The evil Cao Cao  ended up 'winning' the battle in the end. But is evil, chaotic  empire was resolved to dust. So is the way of the world. The goodness of  the world's mana and underlying goodness of the human soul cannot be  quenched by even the greatest, smartest chaotic evil executive. The good  won the war. Even in death, the Good Heroes, Zhuge Liang, Guan Yu, Liu Pei  and Zhang Fei are now religious figures. They have transcended time and  have conquered so many more people with their intellect, love and morality  than Cao Cao could have ever dreamed of. This is a book of biblical  proportions.

423,"Moss Roberts' translation is absolutely fantastic. Much more alive than others. Take the opening sentences:  'Here begins our tale. The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.'  Compare this with Taylor's translation:  'Domains under heaven, after a long period of division, tends to unite; after a long period of union, tends to divide. This has been so since antiquity.'  Or Hegel's:  'Empires wax and wane; states cleave asunder and coalesce.'  It's really no contest. Roberts' prose is lively and absolutely engaging throughout. He's that rare translator who not only understands the nuances of the original language but has a keen ear for English prose. The only complaint I have about this edition is that all the footnotes (and there are a *lot*) are at the back of the 2nd volume, which means that while reading the first two-thirds of the epic, you have to carry around both volumes (and these are big, heavy books). I don't know if there are other high-quality printings of Roberts' translation which might improve on this issue, but I wouldn't even consider a different translator.

424,"Now for the diatribe.  This is the 2nd translation I have read. For the westerner all the Chinese names can get confusing. One approach is to imagine an Asian coming to America and all your friends names are Smith, Jones, and Williams. At least I know quite a few, and they are NOT related. This translation actually has an appendix in the 2nd volume that lists all the names. REALLY HELPFUL!   Personally, I started reading the 1st translation I have, (in four volumes 'not for sale in the USA') as the tv series, Game of Thrones got into it's 2nd season. My friends, who I watch it with are fanatics about the series. makes sense it has been the #1 TV show, several years running. For me, the Three Kingdoms has been much more enjoyable. Sometimes history is just better than the the most creative fiction. Now, this is a romanticized version of a piece of early Chinese history almost 2000 years ago. Every so often, I have to remind myself that this stuff essentially did happen. There is one scene, (an event in actual history) regarding some actions by Cao Cao that is, well, still talked about today in China, and a very dark stain to Chinese history. (OK, so there are some serious stains in Scottish and western history..)    As a westerner, I have to keep reminding myself that so much of what I am reading did actually happen. Even when I step away and remind myself that the author himself, (or whom this writing is  accredited to), lived centuries later. Well, the authors time is STILL over 1,000 years ago! Step away from Games of Thrones, or better, since the series has to wait for the author to catch up, use that break and read this series. Don't worry if all the names and locations appear confusing. Just read it. I read half of it over two days non-stop. (fortunately it was the weekend) and I am NOT a bookworm. It is hard to get me to sit down and read something.  Perhaps I am praising this work too much... However, I really feel that this story is one that every westerner in the 21st century should read. It will not explain China or even Asian culture today. As it is considered one of the '5 classics' in Asian culture. It is Camelot on steroids. It almost puts the American Civil War to sleep, and as a proud American, I wish the story of our founding fathers could be half as exciting. Have fun and good luck!

In Volumes 1 and 2, Zhuge Liang has masterminded, with clever maneuvers, victory at the Battle of Red Cliff against Cao Coa and then gone on to capture important cities, thus vastly increasing Liu Bei’s military power with additional soldiers and control of wealthy cities and provinces. Liu Bei dies in Vol. 3 leaving control of his kingdom to his son Liu Shan. Cao Cao, seeks to take advantage of Liu Bei’s death and inexperience of Liu Shan. Cao Cao comes up with a cunning scheme to attack Liu Shan’s kingdom from five directions. I was anxious to read how Zhuge Liang was going to deal with this new threat. However he reclused himself in his hut and would not come out. Finally after 3 days, Liu Shan goes to Zhuge Liang’s hut to hear what plans he has in mind. Zhuge Liang has brilliant plans to thwart each of the five attacks. He will himself lead the attack again the fierce Man tribes. In his fight against the Mans, after the battle he releases their leader on the faith of his good word that they will not fight again. This happens six times that Zhuge Liang battles and has victory over the Mans, each time capturing the leader and releasing him. After the seventh time, Zhuge Liang refuses to even see the leader of the Mans and has his assistant release him. At this, the leader of the Mans was so humiliated that he agreed to have a peace alliance with Liu Shan and have peaceful cooperation in the future.
