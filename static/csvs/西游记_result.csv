19,20,4,积极,0.07240896358543417,"I have reached, with sadness, the end of my journey through the four-volume, four-hundred-year-old Chinese classic, 'The Journey to the West.' I plodded through the lengthy but valuable introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu, then set off through the hundred fantastical chapters of the story.    It is not a journey for those who like their fiction in small doses. Nor does it fit the mold of most of the fantasy that I love. True, there are dragons and monsters and mythic battles, but of the two main characters, one is an ugly, ultra-violent, supernatural monkey, and the other is a timorous, puritanical monk. Moreover, the narration is less immersed in the characters' viewpoints than I usually prefer, partly because it frequently breaks into poetry. Perhaps the biggest departure from typical fantasy tomes is that the book is largely episodic. It journeys westward without much of a dramatic arc. While individual episodes have their battles and resolutions, the characters and the situation change slowly, sometimes imperceptibly.    Any or all of the above might have deterred me. Had I been in a more cantankerous mood, perhaps they would have done so. Yet they did not. By and large, I liked the digressions into poetry. I accepted the cowardice of one character, the violence of the other, the less-than-immersive narration, the episodic quality more common to television series than to novels. I liked the lightness of tone, the sense of fun. Most of all, I grew fond of the characters, as I think the author was fond of them. I wanted to spend time in their company, and am left now, at the end of the long journey, missing them.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Anthony-C-Yu/product-reviews/0226971546/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1

41,42,5,积极,0.2353247995626822,"First of all, this is one of the four greatest classics of China, which already merits your attention. To be more specific - this is an epic full of the most diverse adventures, in the style of the glorious Ancient-Greek  Iliad, Odyssey and the Tasks of Hercules. However, strangely enough, this can also be a written description of a computer game, full of battles against ferocious dragons, monsters and corrupted leaders - religious or civil - passing from level to level, till the happy end. The heroes also carry all kinds of special weapons and possess supernatural powers - belonging to a culture that has probably inspired also those very computer games. These heroes' purpose is double - fighting against evil creatures, and refining their own selves in order to reach heavenly immortality. They are three,- symbolizing the three parts of each body. The witty Monkey represents the intelligent resourceful brain. The pious monk Sanzang is the compassionate heart, and Pig - the village-fool - is the greedy stomach, providing the many humorous episodes. In short - never a dull moment. By the way, the Monkey also becomes a monk, and the unintentional pun Monkey-monk provides us with hilarious instants... The first chapters describe how Monkey was born from the primordial union between Heaven and Earth from a stone-egg, and how he defied the heavenly rulers, wrecking havoc in their lofty palaces, ruining their peach-feast, stealing the pills of immortality, winning by ruse a wondrous weapon, subduing ferocious dragons as well as many troops of heavenly soldiers, being cooked in a furnace just to win all-seeing golden pupils, erasing his name from the records of the underworld, thus making himself immortal - and more such brave and indeed incredible feats - only to be subdued, finally, by the great Buddha himself. His only way to release himself from his eternal imprisonment is - to help the pious monk Sanzang, whose life-story is most touching, make the 36,000-miles-journey to the west to fetch the scriptures for the impious easterners. On the way they're surprised by seemingly impossible tasks, such as crossing huge seas or lofty ridges, and in addition they meet all kinds of unimaginable powerful fiends, which they must fight according to the different circumstances. Each battle is described in a short free poem, just as the breathtaking views of the mountains, brooks, rivers, storms, flowers and birds are described lyrically. Each of the many adventures - about 60, at least - is self-contained, and so, even if the reading stretches over several months - nothing's lost. The reading is easy and pleasant, and mostly - encouraging - since each battle symbolizes our own daily hardships, and so each victory is ours too!!.. Since the book concentrates mostly on the versatile ever-lasting fight between Good and Evil, with very little romance, for example, it could be read by any child, just like fairy-stories. And so, whoever is looking for a present for a youngster, even 10 years old, or whoever is willing to teach a computer-addicted boy or a teenager to dedicate some time to simple reading - this is the book for the task!! Plus, whoever is willing to enjoy a long journey from China to India, with everything it has to offer - sceneries, people, trades, spirituality, vices, different habits of many countries - at least twelve are mentioned - and also visit many levels of heaven and even the underworld on the way - and get out of it intact - all this without leaving the comfortable home and even bed - especially during long cold nights - just step out and invest in buying this book - it's simply indispensable!!!  A personal confession - I happened to be born in the Year of the Monkey according to the Chinese astrology, and on the day of the Monkey according to the Mexican astrology - so I'm a double Monkey, and I'd detested it!!! Till I've completed the reading of this book. Now I can be proud of myself, just for having such a representative in one of the most fascinating specimens of the world literature - the most charming Monkey you'll ever meet!!! :-)",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1

The actual paperback novels are approximately 7' x 4.25,' so easy to hold in your hand and tuck into a briefcase.  The pages are a bit thin, not 'Bible' thin, but they are a bit thinner than most paperback books.  One of my volumes didn't hold up well to sitting in a steam-filled bathroom.  There are occasional pictures and sparse endnotes, but they do not detract from the story at all.  The pictures were drawn during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and are done in the old chinese style, not some new-fangled doodles.  Some of the translation is a bit iffy, and sentences do not necessarily always make sense, but you'll understand it contextually.  Some of the wording is extremely quaint, such as Pig complaining that the demons failed to drink 'acuppa' with them.  There is much more painfully British vernacular, but it just adds to the goofy charm of this book.  Don't bother wringing your hands over the never-ending list of characters.  Skim over them and read on.  After all, there are an awful lot of demons and gods to meet on the journey, and quite a few of them are fated to die via Monkey's cudgel, making their characters irrelevant in the long-run.  One thing I noticed is that there is an awful lot of scatological farce for a book written in the Ming dynasty (don't worry, it's still hilarious).  I've read a couple translations of Monkey King, and while they'll all stay in my personal library, this is the one I anticipate picking up again and again.  I loved this book as a child and ten years later, I still do.  A must-read for fans of mythology or Chinese literature in general.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1

47,48,4,积极,0.15561988787795236,"This is the most complete and faithful translation of Journey to the West I have yet found. It is the third version of the story I've read, and unlike those other versions ('Adventures of Monkey King'/ISBN 0962076511 and 'Monkey : A Journey to the West [ABRIDGED]'/ISBN 1570625816), it contains the complete and unabridged story, preserving very faitflly both the style and content of the original story. This extreme faithfulness is both a strength and a weakness. It's a strength in that you get a real feeling for the scope of the original work, and you get to hear all the interesting little back-stories and side-stories that make Journey to the West one of the great works of Chinese literaure. It's a weakness because these stories often seem completely irrelevant, and may be quite confusing to someone who is not familiar with Chinese culture and religion. For example, every time something happens in Heaven, Hell or in the palace of the Tang Emperor, the book includes a complete list of everyone who attended. In Heaven, at least, many of the names are descriptive (names of stars, constellations, etc.) and are therefore translated. In the Tang Emperor's palace, though, you'll get a list of 10 or 20 names in Chinese, and only some of the names ever get stories attached to them in the book (and I challenge any non-Chinese speaker to remember the names when they do show up again). There's also a lot of poetry, and though the translations are good, translated poetry can never equal the original. In one sequence, a fisherman and a woodsman argue in verse for 10 or more pages of very small type, frequently singing songs set to tunes few non-Chinese would recognize by name. These characters are important only in that the end of their conversation sets up a conflict, so the only purpose of the sequence is to provide a chance to read the poetry. It's good poetry, to be sure, but it really can drag a bit. You can't just automatically skip over all the poems, as you might do with Tolkien, either. Elements of the story are often told in verse. You can usually skim if you're not interested in a particular bit of verse, but don't skip it entirely. The structure of the work is also surprisingly complex at times, especially given its age. It will at times veer far from the main thrust of the story to recount the entire life history of a character, and has many side stories that somehow tie back into the main plot several chapters later. You may at times find yourself wondering just why the author chose to include a particular bit of story, but there's almost always a payoff waiting somewhere down the line. Another problem is that the style of the storytelling is not very concise. If someone in the story needs to recount what has happened to them, you'll get a second, (fortunately much abridged) version of an earlier portion of the story, written as dialog, this time. You could make similar sorts of complaints about many of the early great works of English fiction, or probably just about any other country's older fiction, so this is not really a strong criticism given the work's great age, but I often found myself wishing the author (or the translator) had just written, 'he told them what had happened' and left it at that. There were also many quirks of the translation that bothered me. The word 'memorial' was used throughout instead of 'memorandum'. It took me quite a while to figure out that was what was going on. I read all of the abridged translation that also made the same mistake throughout, but still didn't figure it out until I was several chapters into this one. Will all these complaints, you're probably wondering why I gave the book 4 stars. The fact is, for all its faults and quirks, 'Journey to the West' is still one of the greatest works of fiction ever written. The Monkey King is without a doubt my favorite character in any work I have ever read or watched. The story of his journey is a brilliant parable on the jouney to enlightenment, while at the same time a story of great humor and exciting action. It also provides fascinating insight into the history and traditional culture of China. If you want to get the whole story and can't read Chinese, this edition is your absolute best bet. (Indeed, it's pretty much your only bet.) Some of the other translations may be a faster read, but none are as satisfying.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1
48,49,5,积极,0.038244047619047615,"I bought the paperback edition several years ago. I loved the myths and read the material several times. Unfortunately, the paperbacks are poorly printed and not bound well enough for multiple readings. I just received the hardbacks and make the following observations: 1) left-hand pages are printed in Chinese while right-hand pages are printed in English, 2) pictures are on single pages with the facing pages blank, 3) binding seems to be very well done - strong as well as supple, and 4) there is a bookmark ribbon attached to the binding side of each volume. In summary, this looks like a quality edition. The hardback is printed in 6 volumes while the paperback (English only) is done in 3. I assume that the translation in the hardback is the same as in the paperback version. That was done very well and I'm looking froward to rereading the adventure with quality paper in my hands; that's one of the real luxuries in life!  I have, above, made several assumptions based on my prior experience with the paperback. If these assumptions prove wrong, I will update this review and my rating.  This is in addition to my original review: I am now reading Volume 4 of 6. There is a horrible error in that volume. There are many missing pages from Volume 4; in their place are many pages from Volume 2. I am knocking two stars off the rating because of this. The vendor said he will send me a proper Volume 4 in October when his stock is replenished. I, fortunately, can finish reading the story because I have the paperback version from the same translator. If I receive a valid copy of Volume 4, I will re-rate upwards and assume there was just a bad run.  I also note at this time that there are many little typos: wrong one of to, two, too; many one-letter substitutions; etc. I am of the opinion that the final edit of a translation should always be made by a native speaker of the 'to' language. I'm guessing that this opinion was not respected here. The errors in the paperback version, if memory serves me correctly are different.  This is a second update to my review: I have just received a corrected copy of Vol. 4 from the seller. Thus, I assume that good copies of this book set are available. I would caution you to check with your seller of choice that the hard copy set you order is one that does not contain the mistakes that were in my original order.

49,50,4,积极,0.14203924162257497,"If you want to test the waters before jumping into the deep end, may I suggest that you first watch the Sci-Fi Channel mini-series 'The Lost Empire' (2001), originally aired under the title 'The Monkey King'. While far from a faithful adaptation, it is a very good introduction to the main characters and overall concept(the character of Sanzang aka Tripitaka being replaced by an American scholar of Chinese literature.)  This is an incredibly lengthy story for anyone not prepared for what is inside. The basis for one of Asia's most beloved children's characters (Monkey), the tale is written as a series of short stories seemingly crafted with children as the target audience. Fashioned similar to western children's adventures ('1001 Arabian Nights' comes to mind), each snippet of the journey comes with lots of action and shallow motivation - often falling to greed, hunger, hubris, revenge or a simple thirst for adventure. I feel certain that these stories were kept easily accessible by many parents through the years as a means of entertaining their children. While the characters are far from anyone's idea of the heroic stereotype, their flaws also help to endear them.  I don't want to give the impression that I am critical of this work or that I would discourage anyone from reading it, only that this may not be the right choice for your first foray into Chinese literature. Many adults in Asia will unashamedly admit to having read the full volumes (I once spent a couple of hours discussing favorite stories and swapping character impersonations with the CEO of a large company in China during a business dinner) but western readers will likely find it disjointed and often hard to follow. Though rarely pivotal to the story and generally addressed in the generous notes, the author has a great propensity for injecting phrases and concepts that the casual reader will simply not be familiar with. I often found myself running to Google in the middle of a paragraph. There is also the tendency for characters to be referred to by multiple names or titles (Monkey has more than seven) with no easy way to keep them straight.  All things considered, I tend to view 'Journey to the West' less as entertainment than as one small facet of the cultural legacy of China.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2

As a disclaimer, let me say that the most important aspects of translation for me are interest and readability. I couldn't care less about the 'accuracy', or 'tone of the original work,' etc.).  Perhaps I want something different from a translation than most. While many scholars want the reader to see the flavor of the Chinese original, I want the work to stand on its own in my language. I don't want to have to learn Chinese in order to appreciate the work. With these thoughts in mind, I am disappointed in Jenner's translation of 'Journey to the West'.  I am no scholar. While I have read a few works here and there, the reading was solely for my amusement. To be sure, some of the works of ancient Chinese literature have truly moved me (I have read 'Three Kingdoms' four times, straight through, and have perused it uncountably often). I challenge any reader to find a better adventure tale than Shapiro's retelling of 'Outlaws of the Marsh', and 'The Scholars' has an immediacy even in today's world. However, while the saga of the Monkey King can be at times engaging, I often lose focus sifting through the religious imagery and boring poetry (yes, I suppose it is very good, but most of these poems sound the same, so that in the end, every poetic retelling of a battle or a landscape might as well be the first).  I think that the elements of a TREMENDOUS story are present (indeed, Monkey is a household name among Asian children, even today), but few children or adults can suffer through the tedium of passages such as 'Most benevelont and merciful Boddhisattva' or 'Enlightened Teacher of the Way and Most Compassionate Buddha' over and over. Call me sacreligious, but this is too much. I wish that Jenner's work more resembled Shapiro's, where poetry is often translated as prose or deleted altogether, so as NOT to give away the plot of an entire chapter.

There is a brief exchange of poetry to give audiences a taste of the wonderful range of poems in the original text; there is a succinct casting of the historical significance of the actual pilgrimage made; the elegant narrative devices carry the story along its 16 year course with both divine swiftness and mundane agony; the events depicted mark truly significant spiritual experiences. The delightful humor is preserved, and the epiphanies shine through.  Sure, I wish Zimmerman had included the attempt on the monk's life when Monkey tricks the monster into swallowing him and then does calisthenics in the monster's tummy until the monk is freed, but that is just a personal favorite, and the stage directions do allow for additional incidents to be mimed in the background, so....

73,74,4,积极,0.1540822339036625,"There are, at present, two complete versions of the long Chinese comic novel 'Journey to the West'.  One of them, the more recent, is published by Anthony Yu at Chicago University Press.  The other, an older version made by W. J. F. Brenner for the Foreign Language Press, is made over five decades ago, but is as yet still not completely superseded.  Looking through the translations, it's obvious that both are worthy undertakings by two enthusiatic contemporary Sinologists.  Anthony Yu, though not a native English speaker, is professor of East Asian studies at the Chicago University, an expert in his field, and an ethnic Chinese.  Brenner is a long-time Sino translator who has rendered his fair share of Chinese classics into English.  So how did these two translations fare compared with each other?  Brenner is a no-nonsensical and very sensible translator of the Wu Cheng'en's book.  While he doesn't take great liberties with the text, when required, he demonstrates lots of felicities in reframing Chinese ideas and philosophies into English. Take the beginning for instance, a difficult passage which involves understanding of Chinese arithmetics and metaphysics.  Here is Brenner's version:  'In the arithmetic of the universe, 129,600 years make one cycle. Each cycle can be divided into twelve phases: I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII. VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the twelve branches. Each phase lasts 10,800 years.  'Now within a single day, the positive begins at the time I; at II the cock crows; at III it is not quite light; at IV the sun rises; V is after breakfast; and at VI one does business. VII is when the sun reaches noon; at VIII it is slipping towards the west; IX is late afternoon; the sun sets at X; XI is dusk; and at XII people settle down for the night.'  This is elegant as is readable and comprehensible to an English audience.  Although Brenner forgoes the nitty-gritties of exact transliteration, he did not excise anything of note, and got the gist of the passage right.  One could imagine this is how the author would have composed in English.  Brenner's translation is consistently fine and accurate.  His language is on the whole simple and easily understood as long you have a high school degree.  Where Brenner is more limited, as compared to Arthur Waley's classic abridged 'Monkey', is in recreating the full range of tones and satiric emotions of the original.  'Journey to the West' is a satirical, high-spirited adventure story; Brenner is idiomatic and readable, but he can occasionally sacrifice some of the original's comic mischievousness.  Here Waley is incomparable; though he may sound a little arch, one has no doubt Waley is at one with Wu Cheng'en's spirit.  Brenner, on the other hand, can at times sound a little too matter-of-factly.  There are moments where you will chuckle in delight reading Waley, but might not do so with Brenner.  Now to Anthony Yu's version.  Made in the 1980s, it, too, is a highly commendable piece of work.  The first thing one notices about it is its extreme faithfulness to the text - even more so than Brenner's.  At times, it even strikes one as being slavish.  One must praise his version for being so strictly straightforward, though at times this literalmindedness makes some word choices incomprehensible to English readers.  Take his constant rendition of 'Wood Mother' for instance, a term which has no meaning whatsoever in English, or 'eating rice' for 'taking a meal'.  This is a version especially good if you know your Chinese and would like a crib to read the original with.  While maybe not as idiomatic as Brenner, Yu is even more academic and scholarly in that he attempts to translate every character of the language.  Faithfulness to the letter of the text takes foremost priority, sometimes over readibility. The success rate is varying, but the translation is on the whole an admirable one.  Comparing the two, both Yu and Brenner can be recommended.  Yu would be first choice if fidelity to the text is your priority.  If you prefer your English to be more idiomatic and the story to flow better, Brenner should be considered.  The two run pretty close and neither is yards ahead of the other.  But Waley's translation is still a marvellous read, and even if it is highly abridged, it should under no circumstances be forgotten.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4

75,76,4,积极,0.09045893719806763,"I finally finished Journey to the West the other day. At over 3,000 pages across four volumes, it's quite a journey in and of itself. I will examine plot, characters and polish before assigning a grade.   This is a review of the novel as a whole. I might do something more specific at a later date.   PLOT   The novel itself is basically two stories. First is the Rise and Fall of the Monkey King and the second is Xuanzang's journey to fetch scriptures from Thunder Monastery.   The Rise and Fall of Monkey is like a Protagonists Journey to Villain. It starts off with Stone Monkey becoming the Handsome Monkey King and going on adventures to protect his kingdom from threats, up to and including death-by-old-age. Then he gets so full of himself he attacks gods and rebels against heaven. In the end this villain is defeated.   The plot is quick, fast paced and constantly escalates. The method by which Monkey becomes so powerful makes sense. The series of events that lead to him trapped under Five Elements Mountain is driven by character decisions. It can stand alone as a complete story. Naturally, Monkey fans want to see him get out from under that rock but it can stand alone.   The rest of the novel is Xuanzang's journey to fetch scriptures. It has an interesting start. There's this Dante's Inferno thing as part of the set up and there's also how Xuanzang gets involved in the quest and then how he recruits his three disciples. Then it's basically filler until they reach Thunder Monastery.   The Pilgrims encounter demons that want to eat/seduce Xuanzang and Monkey has to rescue him. Usually, he has to seek help from other deities instead of simply smashing everything in his path. There's occasional variations, like helping a kingdom from an unrelated demon scheme, problems with humans, or a Broken Bridge.   I like the ending. It's a good ending, with closure and such.   CHARACTERS  Because there is No Antagonist, the only developed main characters here are the pilgrims themselves.   Xuanzang is basically a walking plot device because he takes no action other than starting the journey and placing the headband on Monkey's head. Monkey could jump back and forth between Thunder Monastery and Tang capital twenty times with ease but Xuanzang is mortal and cannot ride on clouds so he has to go the long and hard way. He gets captured to involve the Pilgrims in the affairs of demons along the way and insists on helping everyone (even if they're a demon in disguise), thus providing the excuse to delay the Journey.  If the other three characters in your cast are criminal demons, then it's necessary to have somebody like this but he could stand to be more like a true Good Shepherd and less like a jerkass.   Monkey is like a Trope Maker or something for general shonen anime heroes: he's rude, arrogant, and defeats enemies by beating them senseless with his superior martial arts but he is also driven by a kind heart that wants to protect his subjects. In addition, he is an old and cunning trickster. Many of his victories rely on sneaking around gathering Intel and then devising a strategy to overcome his opponent's advantages. He also knows more about Buddhist teachings than his own master, who was raised a Buddhist monk.   Pig is basically a sidekick type character. He makes wisecracks, helps the hero in small ways, and gets captured occasionally.   There isn't much to say about Friar Sand (or the dragon prince/horse for that matter).   POLISH   When you're translating over 3,000 pages of Chinese into English, there's bound to be some typos. I only found a couple, which is admirable on the part of the translator.

I read this in my free time and knew little to to nothing of Chinese history.  Somethings, I feel, are definately lost in translation here. I understand that much of the Poetry is layed out in beautiful rhymes and even set to music in Mandarin or whatever dialect came first but to read these parts translated quite so literaly into english is as painful as it is reduntant. I tried to skip some of it but once in a while, there is one tiny detail that you have to catch in the poetry explanations that are integral to the overal story of a given chapter. In that respect, we pay a culture penalty for reading this in english, no matter how skillfully this book was translated.  The origion chapters for the main characters where a thrill ride and every bit worth the cost of the book. After you have established the characters and their origion stories and they set off on their, well.. 'Journey to the West', some of the monster stories start to follow simular patterns. The middle to end parts of this book may have made for an entertaining tv series. Every chapter there was always some kind of monster trying to eat the Tang Priest guy that Monkey and company where escourting. If it wasn't scary monster animal/demon spirits trying to eat the Monk to gain immortality, it was some female monster/animal/demon spirit trying to have sex with the Tang priest to gain immortality because he was an 8th generation reincarnated virgin saint or something. These stories are intermitten with other chapters that had to do with them taking a detour or having to deal with someone from Monkey's past or some monsters trying to mess with our hero's for whatever reason.  There are alot of crossover cameos from other numerous Chinese and Indian storys and mythologies. To that end, it has sort of a Shrek 2 vibe to it. This book is an epic, every bit as worthy, if not more so, than the likes of the Illiad or The Lord of the Rings. This also reads like a comic book that hasn't been fully illistrated yet.

It is a story that has been adapted in the form of operas, television series, cartoons and movies many times over.  To be able to read a complete and unabridged version of this epic is a joy indeed.  My only regret is that as a Western-educated Chinese, I am not able to read this masterpiece in it's original language.  Although the translator does a very good job at translating the book, I am sure many nuances and subtleties of the Chinese language have been lost in the translation. The story is a simple one.  Set during the early Tang dynasty (the peak of Chinese civilisation), a holy Buddhist monk has to travel from China to India to collect the true Mahayana Buddhist scriptures from the Lord Buddha himself, in order to bring enlightenment to his fellow country men.  The journey is a long and ardous one, not least because numerous demons lie waiting in ambush for a chance to capture and eat the monk, as his holy body will confer immortality on whoever eats it.  Thus, the Goddess of Compassion assembles a strange group of bodyguards for the monk: the proud and mischievous Monkey, the lustful and greedy Pig, the loyal and steadfast Friar Sand, and a Dragon Prince transformed into a horse.  Their various adventures are so full of humor and wacky hijinks that I cannot help myself from laughing out from time to time.

The most lovable character is obviously Monkey, who will stop at nothing to protect his feeble Buddhist master the Tang priest Sanzang.  Zhu the pig is also interesting as an incessantly loathsome character who specializes in overeating and over-indulging in just about everything.  The only character I think could have been more developed was Friar Sand.. :(.  The most predictable one was Quan Yin who always ends up saving Monkey for the first two books.

82,83,2,积极,0.12764831349206343,"Though 'Journey to the West' is immeasurably important in the history of fiction, I find it hard to recommend it in its entirety. Sure, the story itself is a classic, but it, for the most part, is also incredibly dull, repetitive, and downright confusing as an actual novel. For instance, the story begins with a longwinded explanation of how the Kalpa system works. Fine, that's pretty interesting. This serves as a transition into the actual story, which begins like so: 'There was once a magic stone on the top of this mountain which was thirty'six feet five inches high and twenty'four feet round. It was thirty'six feet five inches high to correspond with the 365 degrees of the heavens, and twenty'four feet round to match the twenty'four divisions of the solar calendar. On top of it were nine apertures and eight holes, for the Nine Palaces and the Eight Trigrams.'  Okay, we get it. There was a rock on a mountain. Moving on...  'There were no trees around it to give shade, but magic fungus and orchids clung to its sides. Ever since Creation began it had been receiving the truth of Heaven, the beauty of Earth, the essence of the Sun and the splendour of the Moon; and as it had been influenced by them for so long it had miraculous powers. It developed a magic womb, which burst open one day to produce a stone egg about the size of a ball. When the wind blew on this egg it turned into a stone monkey.'  Wait, what? How? Back it up a second! Hey!  'When the stone monkey had learned to crawl and walk, he bowed to each of the four quarters. As his eyes moved, two beams of golden light shot towards the Pole Star palace.'  Huh?! Why?!  I assumed that the monkey's origin was in line with the mythical creator Pan Gu's, given the similarities, but after page one, it's never acknowledged. We never learn why the rock changes into a monkey of anything in the universe it could've been. And the light thing? No hint of reason is given, it just happens. There are plenty of moments like this. Bizarre, mystical mumbo jumbo that's never explained. I've asked fans and scholars alike about this scene, and to this day, there is no explanation of what the hell it's supposed to mean.  Oh, and the poetry... ugh. Every few paragraphs, the story suddenly grinds to a halt so that the narrator can expound an awkwardly translated poem. Usually, these serve to replace the conventional act of conveniently describing something. Usually, this means pointing out every intricate detail of a character's outfit or a plot of land for no real reason. Maybe it sounds wonderful in its original Chinese, but the translations I've read are all cringe-worthy. Here's an example, also from the first few pages. This one describes a feast:  'Golden pills and pearl pellets, Bursting red and plump yellow. The golden pills and pearl pellets were winter cherries, beautiful and sweet; The bursting red and plump yellow were ripe plums, tasty and sharp. Fresh, sweet'fleshed longans with thin skins. Fiery lichees with tiny stones in a red sack. Branch after branch of crab'apples, Yellow'skinned loquats with their leaves on. Rabbit'head pears and chicken'heart jujubes To quench your thirst, remove your cares, and sober you up. Fragrant peaches and tender apricots, As sweet and luscious as jade wine.'  This goes on for a page and a half. I think that just about explains it.   That said, this novel has a major upside: the actual story of the first seven chapters. Though it's largely considered a prologue by purists (most of whom just Wikipedia summaries of chapter eight and up) the wild adventure of Sun Wukong the monkey king, which I'll call Part One for convenience's sake, is the only part anyone really cares about. Poetry and lackluster prose aside, Part One is one big swashbuckling adventure, following Wukong's rise to power and war against Heaven. It's colorful, epic, and the only section that follows a consistant plot. It also contains some of the most famous moments in Chinese fiction, including Wukong's training (the basis for Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back), the Buddha's Palm scene, and one incredible chase sequence that really knocked me off my feet. When Part One wraps up, though, everything goes downhill.  The actual journey westward sees a main character switch and a change in format. The alleged meat-and-potatoes of the novel follows a monk named Xuanzang as he and his four desciples, including Wukong, as they travel to India to acquire a set of scriptures. This section takes from Chapter 8 to 97, and between those points, there is no concept of coherence or character development. It's entirely episodic and formulaic to a point where you can skip 95% of it and nothing will have moved forward. Most of these episodes consist of Xuanzang being kidnapped by a monster-of-the-week and Wukong saving him while their comrades contribute little to nothing at all. It gets old fast, and the overly direct translations don't help at all.  There is very little reason to keep reading after Part One. Some of the demons during the main quest are fun, I very much like the main party, even if none of them develop at all during the course of the story, but there isn't much to go on once Sun Wukong steps out of the limelight in Chapter 8.  Instead, I recommend a few alternatives.  -The kid's TV series that aired on the BBC in the 80's, called 'Monkey'. It's pure, hyperactive, campy fun.  -The Chinese animated film 'Havoc in Heaven' is a beautiful rendering of Part One only.  -Arthur Waley's famous abridged version, also called 'Monkey' cuts out most of the repitition and all of the poetry.

It seems I was pretty serious about my fantasy reading, as evidenced by an inscription to my children in the back of The Fellowship of The Ring, mass market paperback edition circa 1977. I wrote the inscription with a ball-point pen when I was 10. My daughter showed it to me when she was 14 or so. It said something to the effect that I love this book so much that my only wish is to pass it on to my kids so that they can feel what I did when I first read it. Apparently I did, and apparently they did.  I still feel that way about The Lord of The Rings, but I read Journey To The West a couple of years ago, and it made me feel the same way except magnified. I was 37 when I first read it. It was like Tolkien, plus all the L. Frank Baum Oz books plus the Arabian Nights, all the Greek myths, Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams all rolled into one. This book is over 2300 pages, so it took some discipline to get through. But as you go, you savor each moment, each line. When I turned the final page, I was seriously tempted to start again at the beginning. Seriously, it's that good.  It is that good, despite being very far out of context for most people like me. What I mean is, I'm about as Western as you can get, or at least my parents intended me to be so. My understanding is that Chinese kids absorb the Monkey King story by osmosis, they drink it like mother's milk from they day they are born .... kind of like Big Bird or Elmo in the west.  But that's not at all a fair comparison. Big Bird and Elmo fall in the category of pop culture. This same category is fair game for any number of PhD theses in any number of fields of learning. Do you reckon anyone will know who Elmo is 500 years from now? Neither do I. But we still know Monkey today, and I bet we will still know him 500 years from now, if there is anyone around to know anything.  It is possible that Journey to the West is the most widely read or known text in the history of humanity. That's a bizarre thought to those of us brought up in the isolated shelter of Judeo-Christian mythology. I'm sure it is less analyzed than the Christian bible, but then it doesn't exactly beg for analysis: it's obviously a very long fable, indicating very little in the way of how to live one's life, whether or not to eat bacon with tea on a Tuesday morning, or anything else relevant to modern life. It's not about textbook ethics, nor is it about everyday morality. It's not about how to please God or your fellow man (woman if you are one, to quote Colin Hay). It's about fantasy. It's about delight in the sheer variety of the world around. If I were a book, I would want to be about that.  All that is left is for me to suggest that you read Monkey King. It's a project, and you need to get in the right frame of mind. You're going to need some fortitude to read it all, but it's worth it. It really is worth it.  What follows is my somewhat lame attempt to summarize a book which probably shouldn't be summarized. Please ignore it, I wrote it in a fit of passion 2 years ago.  Sun Wukong is the Handsome Monkey King, Great Sage Equaling Heaven. This book is about Sun Wukong, the Monkey.  The novel is composed of 100 chapters, each told as a story such as an oral storyteller might relate. Each chapter ends with a sort of cliffhanger and a directive to read on if you want to know what happens next.  In chapter 1 Monkey is born (hatched ?!) and asserts himself as a force to be reckoned with. He's fairly happy eating exotic fruits and being king of the mountain but eventually the idea of death occurs to him, and he gets quite naturally upset. One of his monkey friends suggests to him that there are 3 kinds of beings who are free from the cycle of death and rebirth: Buddhas, Immortals, and Sages. The Immortals are enlightened ones of the Taoist faith, and Sages refers to Confucianism. The Handsome Monkey King decides to set out on a journey to gain immortality. Eventually (after about 10 years have passed) he runs into a Taoist Immortal who imparts the secrets of everlasting life and great travel powers to him.  Having acquired great cosmic powers, Monkey proceeds to use them. He causes no end of distress to the kings of Hell in Chapter 3, and soon comes to the attention of Heaven (i.e. the Powers That Be). Heaven attempts to placate Monkey's insatiable lust for power and recognition with a fake job and title. Monkey can be fooled, but only for so long, and in the end he causes chaos in Heaven (which is a bad thing). The Jade Emperor of Heaven calls out all the armies of demons, heavenly generals and warriors, you name it. Time after time they try to take Monkey into custody and fail, until finally the Buddha himself steps in and traps Monkey. Handsome Monkey King is imprisoned under a mountain for some 500 years.  By now we're up to chapter 8, in which the Bodhisattva Guanyin sets out on a journey to appoint a pure hearted priest to go west and bring back the scrolls of wisdom from the Buddha's Western Paradise. On the way Guanyin flags a couple of demons to help the priest on his journey. In chapters 9 through 12 we learn about Sanzang, the Tang Priest who is destined to recover the scriptures from the West, a million miles away, or so it seems. Sanzang is a rather weak fellow, a mere mortal with no special powers of any kind. His strength is the pureness of his heart and his faith in his mission.  The Journey to the West is Sanzang's voyage to recover the scrolls, and it really begins in chapter 13. He does not have an easy time of it, being almost constantly beset by tigers, monsters and demons, not to mention deep dark forests and formidable mountain ranges. However the Tang Priest quickly gets help, in the form of a dragon transformed into a horse, a flesh eating demon who works as a bodyguard and gopher, and a gluttonous moronic pig-demon who serves nicely as a luggage carrier. But most importantly he acquires Monkey, who is freed from his imprisonment under the mountain on the condition that he helps the Tang Priest and cultivates his behavior, learning to be a good Buddhist monk. Imagine Monkey with a shaved head.  Once the cast is assembled, the journey begins in earnest. Monkey, the Idiot (Pig), Sandy and the dragon horse accompany Sanzang through 30000 miles of dangerous terrain, beset by evil spirits and demons at every turn. By this time we're done with chapter 25, 585 pages into the novel, and we've closed the back cover of Volume 1. In the other hand we hold Volume 2, almost drooling with anticipation.  Throughout the next 75 chapters, the action is pretty much non-stop. There are lots of bad guys, and Monkey gets lots of chances to show off his incredible magical powers, his sheer brute force, and his amazing mental capacity. His conversations and arguments with The Tang Priest and The Idiot are always amusing and sometimes hilarious. His martial prowess, wielding the As-You-Will Iron Cudgel, is unparalleled. Sometimes even Monkey gets in over his head and has to call in an air strike in the form of Heavenly forces, or various Gods, Constellations, or other muscle.  I won't give away the ending, but suffice it to say it's a happy one, after 2317 pages.  As to the quality of the translation I have nothing to add. It was more than readable to me: it was a delight, poetry and all.  As to the quality of the editing, it's not perfect. On the other hand, the flaws don't detract from the experience at all.  As to the quality of the printing: keep in mind that this is published by Foreign Language Press of Beijing. In some ways FLP doesn't live up to American standards of production quality, but in others it excels them. The paper is necessarily thin, but the books are tightly bound. These are not mass-market paperbacks. One does not feel that the books will fall apart on a second reading, and there is very little danger of breaking the spine. Also, Journey to the West is nicely illustrated with Qing Dynasty pictures. The quality of the reproductions is not the highest, but let's not bite the hand that feeds us. My box of Journey to the West was a bit scuffed and dinged and dented. Same with the other titles I have purchased from FLP through Amazon. I imagine this is FLP's fault. I'm not entirely happy about it but for a book this great, I can live with a couple of small physical flaws (especially at this price). I'm just happy I got my grubby little monkey paws on it.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6

Tibet.  pretty much the rest of the book deals with the trials and tribulations that these four monks (only three of which are fully developed characters: poor Friar Sand is left as the fifth wheel most of the time) go through in trying to 'fetch' these scriptures for the enlightenment of all humanity.  the priest is a real ding-dong, he's constantly getting himself into all sorts of trouble, and he never heeds the Monkey King's advice about anything, so the Priest is always falling into the jaws of some new monster on virtually every chapter.  the Pig is no better, as he would sooner run into trouble or create trouble for everyone else for the sake of either his pride or his stomach.  the Monkey King is the real hero of this book, as he is constantly rescuing everyone from some sort of demon or tempting succubus around practically every corner.  and what of Friar Sand? . . . well, he is just kind of there to guide the Priest's horse.  this book is definitely worth a read though, i thoroughly enjoyed it, despite its short comings.  the incessant poetry gets kind of annoying though, most of it is relevant to the 'plot' so you can't really skip too much of it.  i give it four stars.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6
94,95,4,积极,0.11883848133848134,"I've been a long time reading this 2300-page classic Chinese 'novel.'  The quotes are there because, if you read it as a novel, you'll grow tired of the repetitive elements in the large body of the story.  Think of it more as a comprehensive compendium of folklore tales centering around the central character, Monkey.  The seed of the story was the actual journey of a Tang dynasty Buddhist priest from China to India and back.  This journey caught the Chinese imagination and somehow became embellished with the mythical Monkey, who ultimately became much more interesting than the priest himself.  Many stories grew around a formula of Monkey protecting the priest from monsters along the journey.  The author, Wu Cheng'en, organized many of these stories into a single narrative, which apparently became the authoritative record of all the Monkey folklore. This unabridged translation by W. J. F. Jenner includes a 'Translator's Afterword,' which I recommend you read before (not after) you read the story itself.  It helps you to understand why there are so many incidents that do little to develop the story or the characters.  This edition was prepared for and printed by the Foreign Language Press of Beijing, so do not expect it to meet American standards of proofreading. If you are chiefly interested in enjoying the story itself, read Arthur Waley's abridged translation, 'Monkey.'  He keeps all the essential elements so that you learn the plot and get to know the characters, but cuts out most of the formulaic 'Monkey vs. monster' stories, so it is paced more like a modern novel.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Vol-English-Chinese/product-reviews/0226971473/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6

This person, represented by a team of the Tang Priest and his four disciples, has personalities like each of them.  We may not know it, but we have an ounce of cleverness and bravery and strength in each and every one of us, like Monkey King, and are we not as stupid, lazy, and lascivious as Pig? Like Frair Sand, we can be steadfast to our beliefs, what is right, and can tell what is man and what is demon, what is right and what is wrong? The horse is repentant of his crime and accepted his converted life as a horse, are we  not like that too? The Tang Priest represents everything that is pure and right, but is a gullible person.  The demons they met on their way represent different sins and temptations, to fight them is a battle within oneself, fighting for what is right and against what is wrong. At last, when all battles against evil are won, they are pure and righteous and changed over the course of the journey, worthy to meet Buddha, get the Sutras, and become Buddhas themselves.  This simple story is lesser known as a religious story, but is still highly recommended by me, because of its exciting plot, great characters,a reflection of Chinese feudalism and society of the time Wu Cheng'en lived, teachings of Buddhism, and knowing a thing or two about Chinese culture, all packaged in one.

It's like an encyclopedia written in the form of a novel!  It's also the most famous fanatasy fiction in the Chinese-speaking world.  Now that's a big deal. The Buddhist monk's mission is to walk all the way from the Chinese capital to India, a distance of at least 2000 miles.  By contrast, the distance between Hobbiton and Mordor is only about 1000 miles.  While the monk's goal is to take back Buddhist books from 'the West,' i.e., India, Frodo's task is to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom of Mordor, i.e., in the East. The Monk is to bring back something of great importance, the Hobbit to destroy it.  The Monk is a man of great wisdom, with an absolutely pure heart, but powerless and helpless in the face of monsters.  He commands the services of his pupil the Monkey King, who has limitless supernatural powers.  Hobbit's strength lies also in his purity of heart, which however fails only at the very end.  Otherwise he is just as powerless as the Monk.  Gandalf is the man of great wisdom and a tremendous wizard who assists Frodo.  'The Journey to the West' is permeated throughout with Buddhist overtones and undertones - like blood in the human body, they are everywhere.  Tolkien's book is pagan, of course, but the distinction between good and evil is no less sharp.  All characters return home heroes. Those who've read both books (or at least seen the films adapted from them) will appreciate the complexity of the Chinese imaginative mind.  Nothing Tolkien wrote can compare.

Their mission: to retrieve the Scriptures from Buddha and deliver them to the Emperor. If they succeed, China will become a happy, prosperous place and the unjustly condemned souls will be rescued. But the journey is fraught with difficulties and deadly perils. In the end it takes 14 years; in the process the four pilgrims meld themselves into a potent, loyal team, win through dozens of unheard-of threats to life and limb, and achieve enlightenment.  This is another long classic in the spirit of 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' that goes on and on with twists and turns that take you by surprise, except for the fact - spoiler alert! - that you know that the four heroes must eventually win through, deliver the Scriptures, and achieve enlightenment. A lot of the Buddhist hierarchy shows up unbidden, or is called upon for help by Monkey as he solves problem after problem on the journey West, so it's an entertaining introduction to those folks. The tone is lighthearted; even the constant threats to the Tang priest's life, as monsters try to capture and eat him (thereby obtaining eternal life by consuming a piece of his pure flesh) have a funny side.  A lot of humor is provided by the irreverent Monkey; he's incapable of very much humility and constantly violates social conventions, even in Heaven; but his heart is usually in the right place. His capabilities are vast, including being immortal and having the power to work all sorts of magic, but his hubris often leads him astray. This is pitched as a children's tale - although the occasional sex and almost constant fairy-tale violence might make it an older children's tale - and the characters reflect childish impulsiveness and disregard for ceremony.

131,132,5,积极,0.1970114942528735,"I currently own 3 different versions of 'Journey to the West', and of the three, this one is probably the best compromise between detail and brevity. I am currently reading it to my 7-year-old (I read it by myself a while ago), and while the vocabulary is definitely a stretch (I have to explain 4 or 5 words on most pages), he's really loving it. The story has all the appeal of a Martial Arts novel, The Wizard of Oz, and a Buddhist philosophical treatise blended into a thoroughly entertaining tale for all ages. I previously read 'Adventures of Monkey King' (ISBN 0962076511) to my son, and while the language was much more appropriate for a young child, the story was overly abridged, and a lot of the detail that makes the story fun and interesting was lost. This edition tells the beginning and the end of the story very well, but leaves out all of the middle episodes between finding the dragon horse, Pigsy, and Sandy and getting to the mountain of fire.  As a result, Pigsy and Sandy are a bit under-developed, but the Monkey King definitely gets a real chance to shine, and you do get a decent feel for Pigsy and Tripitaka, at least.  I kind of appreciate that they left the whole middle section out instead of picking random stories, because that makes it easier to go back to the full version of the story ('Journey to the West (4-Volume Boxed Set)', ISBN 7119016636), and fill in the missing stories if you want to. The way it's told here, the actual journey itself is the smallest part of the story.  It's all about setting up the characters and reaching Inda.  In the full-length version, the story is mostly about the journey, and how it changes the characters. This version is very good for those who want to get the flavor of the characters and 'find out what happens', but the full version is best for those who really just want to enjoy reading about the Monkey King doing what he does best, and aren't anxious for it to end.  Be warned, though, the full version can drag a bit if you're hoping to actually see the plot move along. I have heard that the book 'Monkey/Folk Novel of China' (ISBN 0802130860) best captures the comedic aspects of the story, so that will be my next purchase. The British (well, really, Chinese via Japan) TV series 'Monkey' is also based on this story. I discovered that it has recently been released on DVD in Australia, and that a British release is coming that will include the 13 previously unaired Japanese episodes (with subtitles). As the series was never aired in America, I may need to buy a PAL DVD player to watch it, so that's what I plan to do.

158,159,4,积极,0.1151256613756613,"This is a challenging book to review in that it is long, as are the other classic Chinese epics (Three Kingdoms, Outlaws of the Marsh and Dream of the Red Chamber) and accordingly contains much that will on the one hand provoke, entertain and inspire the modern reader while also containing much many are likely to find infuriating.  The basic plot is simple and well-known (and easily researchable on Wikipedia and other web sites). An emperor of China's Tang dynasty, seeking enlightenment for his kingdom, appoints a monk to journey to the west (India) to worship the Buddha and bring back the scripture. The monk has four disciples (fallen beings who are being given a chance to redeem themselves) who help him. These are the Monkey King, the Pig, and Friar Sand, and the horse. Pig and Friar Sand were heavenly Generals who messed up and were put into the bodies of animals. The horse is a dragon who is working off a sin by being in the body of a horse. Monkey was born of stone and is redeeming himself after having caused considerable chaos in and even revolted against heaven, taking on everybody there including the Jade Emperor (a stand-in, it seems, for God).  This is based on a true story wherein a Tang emperor really did send a monk on a mission to bring back Buddhist scripture, and also gather information (a Lewis & Clark type exploratory mission). It's a long trip accomplished on foot and for the monk, horseback (the main modes of transportation back then). The disciples can travel via cloud, but not the monk. But in the epic, the length of the trip is the least of the challenges. Again and again and again the party is beset by demons many of whom want to eat the monk's flesh in order to gain eternal life (something that is said to be possible given the monk's purity). Unlike other famous fictional voyagers, though, this monk couldn't fight his way out from under a grain of rice. He spends pretty much the entire epic weeping and complaining. It's mainly Monkey, helped more or less (emphasis on 'less') by the other disciples, that constantly has to overcome the obstacles.  The points of interest, the good parts, come from the nature of the adventures (quite varied and imaginative) and perhaps more important, the key relationships: between Monkey and the Monk, between Monkey and the assortment of deities, and between Monkey and the other disciples.  The monk is the prototypical whiney nerd. As mentioned, his specialties are weeping and complaining. Moreover, he is fooled by more illusions than a ten-year-old at a cheap magic show; actually, he's fooled by all illusions. Monkey, on the other hand, is the one who 'gets it.' His ability to see what's real isn't quite 100%, but its close and even when he errs, he corrects himself very quickly. He is, perhaps, the single greatest, most skilled, and most powerful (lots of magic powers) sidekick in all of literature (East or West).  So you'd think the Monk would revere and trust Monkey, right? Not so. The Monk does not trust Monkey at all and rejects his advice every time, until he gets into a mess and has no choice to do what Monkey demands in order to escape the crisis, only to distrust Monkey again next time. Twice in the epic, Monk gets so angry at what he perceives to be a bad attitude on the part of Monkey, he fires him (kicks him out of the expedition), but, of course, is force to be reconciled lest he wind up as dinner for a monster. But the Monk just doesn't learn. He continually trusts Pig, whose main concern is his own indulgence. As to capabilities, Pig is OK, but a distant second behind Monkey.  I'm not sure why the author fusses about the horse and Friar Sand. Neither has any discernable personality and both seem to be there just to carry stuff. And this is where we begin to get into things that may annoy a modern Western reader. The practice of the art of fiction here is not what we're used to.  The epic relies a lot, and I mean A HECK Of A LOT on a fictional technique known as 'deus ex machina' which translates literally to 'God out of the machine.' It's well known in ancient Greek theater. The author sets up a fascinating plot conflict and then finds himself unable to logically solve it, so an actor playing one the Gods is lowered to the scene from a set of pulleys (the machine) to sort everything out. The Greeks get away with it because the conflict is usually more important than the details of how it's resolved, but even they don't completely escape criticism. In this epic, 'deus ex machina' is used constantly. Like the Greeks, conflict and escape are paramount, but with the Greeks, you get one 'deus ex machina' instance per play. Here, it bombards you again and again and again time after time after time in the same epic to the point where it becomes tempting to skip ahead once the conflict is established because you pretty much know what's coming.  In fact, the adventures get so formulaic after a while, you may wonder if this is really a single epic, or something that was cobbled together from a lot of separate adventure stories. I have no idea what the answer is, but in the work handed down to us, the end implies it is a unified epic and that the crises were orchestrated from heaven to enable the Monk to become worthy of receiving the scriptures. But again, I can't swear this wasn't grafted on at a later time. One of the things that leads me to wonder about this being a unified epic is the way the Monk fails to even start to come to grips with Monkey's merits until the very end. To a modern Western reader, that defies belief, and having read other ancient Chinese epics, I'm not in a hurry to attribute such shallow characterization to the epic's different time and place. Also, the underdeveloped characterizations of Friar Sand and the horse lead me to wonder if they were developed in other segments of the story that got lost, or if the author intended to flash them out but never got around to it.  It's important to note that my speculations as to whether this is a unified work or something that was patched together is just that, personal speculation. I have absolutely no clue about the facts and haven't (at least not yet) even checked to see if there's any research pointing one way or another. What I'm suggesting to you, as a reader of this review, is to draw conclusions about the fact that I am so wrapped up in speculations like this. That tells you a lot about how the work is organized, and how reading it feels as you get beyond the 22-chapters of introductory material.  Clearly, though, the most intriguing character, and the one that makes the whole thing worthwhile is Monkey. His evolution from literature's most potent a**-hole to its most potent protector is riveting and addictive. It's a fascinating object lesson to anyone who has occasion to deal with difficult but talented people. The end of the story implies the monk needed to suffer to earn the right to get the scriptures. We modern folks, though, don't need to go through that. We can, if we wish, try to recognize the merit around us without constantly bringing ourselves to the brink of destruction.",https://www.amazon.com/Monkey-Journey-West-David-Kherdian/product-reviews/1590302583/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3

173,174,5,积极,0.13809523809523808,"[The Journey to the West (西遊記) is so well-known a story in Chinese culture that I won't bother to review the story as such, but will focus on the translation.  This book is the first volume of a four-volume translation.  This review covers all four volumes.]  Any translation of a literary work, let alone between languages as different as Chinese and English are, is an exercise in compromise and cleverness.  A particular sentence in Chinese—even a single phrase—can be rendered in numerous ways in English, each one of them carrying a different set of nuances.  To maintain narrative flow, though, the translator must choose just one of those ways, which represents an indelible choice as to what aspect of the original will be conveyed to the reader.  That is the compromise.  The cleverness comes in the insight and deftness with which the translator crafts and arranges those choices into a coherent whole.  It is said that one should always translate into one's 'A language'—that is, the language in which one is most fluent.  But Dr Anthony Yu was a native Chinese speaker, and although years of teaching in the United States made him fluent in English, it was still not his primary language.  It is a testament to his genius and his decades of work on this, a story that he describes as near and dear to his heart, that this English version is as faithful to the Chinese original as can be hoped, and yet reads as sprightly and as uproariously as though it were, in fact, the original.  Something must be done with those nuances, though.  Some translators choose to insert them directly into the body of the work, as Howard Goldblatt does in his translation of Mo Yan's Life and Death are Wearing Me Out.  But perhaps The Journey to the West is too full of Buddhist, Daoist, and other cultural allusions for them to be adequately captured in a passing sentence.  So Yu's translation is copiously endnoted, and these notes are full of fascinating material on the religious and philosophical environment in which both the story is written and its action takes place.  Included also are scholarly citations that justify, with a degree of rigor that will probably be overlooked by the average reader, all the various word and phrasing choices he made.  In some cases, Yu's study has even found errors in the original text.  The first volume of this translation adds an introduction that describes the textual history of this story, Wu Cheng'en's presumed authorship, biographical sketches of the real people depicted in the novel, and Wu's motivations for writing it, and them, the way that he did.  These additions admirably fill out the narrative and setting delivered to us so seamlessly by Yu.  Other translations may have quainter charm or somewhat more fluid English, but this one provides such a complete perspective on the novel that it presents itself immediately as the de facto standard.  A must have for the dedicated reader.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Revised-1/product-reviews/0226971325/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1
174,175,3,积极,0.09544817927170868,"'The Journey to the West' is a lengthy 16th century novel, regarded as one of the four great classics of Chinese literature. The author of the book is uncertain, but is thought to be Wu Cheng'en. This volume contains the first twenty-five chapters of the hundred-chapter narrative, plus extensive notes and a ninety-six-page introduction by the translator, Anthony C. Yu. I found the introduction a difficult read, no doubt due to my prior ignorance about almost everything it covered. But the introduction was helpful, and I am glad I labored through it.  The book itself defied my expectations. It was neither dry, nor dense, nor inscrutable. To my surprise, it appears to have been intended to be fun, and, despite the intervening centuries, I often found it such. The narrative is a fantastical retelling of Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain Buddhist scriptures, a pilgrimage that took place roughly a thousand years before 'The Journey to the West' was written. In the retelling, there are gods, monsters, dragons, trickery, humor, and a plethora of epic fights. There is also a remarkably large amount of poetry, serving both as description and commentary, and the poetry lightened the reading. Since this volume contains only the first quarter of the story, I will postpone further comments for now.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Revised-1/product-reviews/0226971325/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1

This is a fun book to read, and one whose stories you can tell to young children and amuse them with their silliness.  The stories are filled with imagination and humor.

177,178,4,积极,0.1326894965919356,"I read the four-volume revised Kindle edition of this book, translated by Anthony C. Yu. The story is the fictive rendition of a journey made by a 7th century Buddhist monk, Xuanzang, during the Tang Dynasty. He undertook his famous, nearly two decade-long pilgrimage in order to study Buddhism and acquire original Sanskrit texts of the religion from India. When he returned to China, he translated many of the original texts to Chinese, thus leaving a decisive legacy on Chinese Buddhism. Some of the pilgrim's original scrolls are saved in a pagoda inside Xingijao Temple near today's Xian.  The story starts with the mystical events of a creature becoming the (Handsome) Monkey King. Through various twists and turns, he acquires great skills and a variety of supernatural power which he will continue to use throughout the book. Some mischievous acts in Heaven land him in trouble but upon the departure of Xuanzang - in the book also called the Tang Monk or Tripitaka after the Three Baskets of Buddhism that held the 3 original Buddhist scrolls - from the Emperor's palace, the Monkey King is given the opportunity to become the disciple and protector of the Monk. In the first phase of the long journey Tripitaka is granted two additional converted vicious monsters as his disciples: Eight Rules who has the appearance of a pig and Sha Monk who has the look of a water buffalo. To complete the mystical traveling company, a water monster is enforced to serve as the replacement of Tripitaka's deceased horse.  The bulk of the story is the description of the group's arduous traveling through impenetrable forests, burning mountains, and dangerous rushing rivers. They encounter countless demons, spirits, monsters, dragons, and fiends who invariably want to devour the guiltless Tripitaka. This enhanced interest in the Tang Monk as a culinary delight roots from his purity that is thought to guarantee extremely long life to the cannibalistic food connoisseurs. With his boundless ingenuity and smarts the Monkey King leads the three disciples to defend the Monk.  For the contemporary reader, the story has a few stumbling blocks, not the least of which is the length of almost 2400 pages. In the book one will find numerous repetitions where the four main heroes tend to recite some of their earlier adventures in various situations when they meet new characters. The reader is already fully aware of these events and they tend to slow down the flow of the story. One can skip these paragraphs however, without losing much from the narration.  For some readers another obstacle could be the numerous poems and songs throughout the book. In my rough estimation 15-20% of the text may well be poetry. The poems are enjoyable and usually provide finer details of, or clarifications to, the main story. As such, they are more functionally part of the book then in another classic pillar of ancient Chinese literature, the poetry in the Dreams of the Red Mansion. In that book the poems and songs are highly transcendent with the purpose of providing insight into the characters' inner selves. I skimmed through many, but not all poems. Others may decide to skip the poems altogether but those who decide to read them in even greater details, will experience an enhanced overall literary beauty of the book.  Of the four characters, the Monkey King is by far the best portrayed one and the main reason I gave not 3 but 4 stars to this book. He is an absolute riot; a perfect timeless embodiment of a bad guy turned good who has a curiously complex psyche with a mixture of self-adoration, self-assuredness, mischief, steadfast loyalty, courage, wisdom, practicality, and, on the top of everything, a great sense of humor. Typical of him is the name he has chosen to himself early in the story: The Great Sage Equal to Heaven. Among all the fictive characters I have encountered in my readings, the Monkey King has become one of my all time favorites for his colorful and likeable temperament and for the exquisite perfection with which he has been portrayed.  Although the Tang Monk is formally the lead-hero of the story, he really pales in comparision to the Monkey King. He is the most benevolent, spiritually pure individual imaginable who is singularly driven by his unshakable convictions and principled Buddhist mind. Unfortunately, he is also gullible to the point of annoyance and this brings a copious amount of trouble to the poor Monkey King.  Eight Rules is a secondary character whose personality is also drawn with an expert pen. He is stupid, yet quite capable in many ways. His loyalty to the Monk never feels solidified, however he seems to function perfectly well under the critical tutelage of the Monkey King and the exculpation of the high-minded Tripitaka.  The character of the third disciple, Sha Monk, is far less complete than the previous three and doesn't deserve particular attention in this review.  Overall, the book in its full length is not an easy read. I recommend it mostly to those tickled by a potential glimpse into the spirituality of an ancient world, namely the Tang Dynasty, from the perspective of a much later, but still very old, time, namely the late Ming Dynasty. What a rare privilege to enjoy such a treasure! An abridged English translation is also available for those curious readers with a more tepid interest.  Additional information: The book has served as inspiration for multiple movies, TV shows, stage plays, and comics. I saw one of these adaptations, Alakazam the Great. This Japanese cartoon film, although adorable in its own right, in no way should be considered a faithful presentation of the original story. I've also read the Ultimate Journey: Retracing the Path of an Ancient Buddhist Monk Who Crossed Asia in Search of Enlightenment, by Richard Bernstein.

206,207,3,积极,0.12522955595740407,"Let me start out by saying that this is one of the most amazing pieces of literature I've ever seen.  I have the utmost respect for anyone who could write something as imaginative as this.  In almost every chapter there are at least four or five things that simply blow the reader's mind.  The only problem is Volume 1 alone is WAY too long.  And there are three MORE volumes to read after this one.  You realize how long it took me to get through just the first volume?  From November to August.  That's almost ten months!  Needless to say, I've read several other books as I was trudging my way through this one.  As much as I love the imagination put into the practically unlimited number of pages, it is just far too much stuff for me to read.  The only flaws in the work besides its extremely massive size are its constant repetitions when it comes to the explanation of the plot, and its somewhat out-of-order plot sequence.  The actual Journey to the West doesn't even BEGIN until chapter 13 or so, and that's halfway through this volume!  Before the Journey starts, we see 7 or so chapters showing how a monkey became immortal, disrupted heaven, and was banished into a prison for 500 years.  Then we see a chapter where a Bodhisattva comes from the Western Heaven to find a scripture pilgrim who will go on a journey to attain some scrolls.  It APPEARS the journey will begin after this Bodhisattva event, but instead the story digresses to a woodsman and a fisherman arguing about who has a better life in SEVEN pages of poems, and then to a dragon king fiddling with heavenly decrees in order to win a bet with a fortune teller, and then to a person who has to go to hell to rescue a dragon king after failing to protect him from being beheaded, and so forth until FINALLY a scripture pilgrim is selected several chapters later and the pilgrim meets and rescues the monkey that was running amuck in the first 7 chapters.  So you can see how the plot sequence is quite perplexing.  Fortunately the plot is thoroughly repeated every two pages or so, so you never get lost, but you do get overwhelmed with repetition.  Now that all of that negativity is out of the way, it's time to discuss the fun stuff.  The monkey named Sun Wu-K'ung is a riot.  He wins battles by plucking a hair from his head, chewing the hair up, spitting it out while shouting 'change,' and the hair turns into hundreds of other monkeys just like himself.  He's armed with a rod that's so large and heavy it was used to weigh down the entire sea, but he's able to shrink the rod to a small enough size to store it in his ear.  He's able to travel hundreds of thousands of miles in a single somersault and transform into pretty much anything he wants.  At one point he transforms into a temple to hide from a powerful enemy, but he can't think of what to do with his tail, so he disguises it into a flagpole.  The enemy laughs and says, 'Whoever heard of a flagpole next to a temple!'  There's a lot of stuff in the story that's pretty darn funny.  The monkey Sun Wu-K'ung is appointed to a post of pi-ma-wen to take care of horses, and at first is pleased until he finds out it's a lowly position in the heavens.  He repeatedly kills little demons who appear to be minding their own business, and the scripture pilgrim he's guarding tells him he should be less hot-headed.  Demons show up in this book like flowers would show up in another book.  It's just not a big deal for the author to slap the word 'demon' on one of the pages in here.  There's an incredible amount of variety in the characters, settings, magical powers, weapons, appearances - you name it.  And everything is always blown WAY out of proportion.  Rivers are 800 miles wide, battles last for 200 rounds, places have names like The Inn of Ten Thousand Flowers, and there are countless different immortal dieties.  Everything is so much larger than life, similar to the thickness of the actual printed work itself.  (It takes up some shelf space alright.)  The creativity may very well be unsurpassed in any adventure I've ever seen.  One monster catches all 5 members of the scripture pilgrim's party in his sleeve to win a battle.  A well-meaning fellow takes watermelons to hell to give some wretched hungry souls a break by putting the watermelons on his head and then drinking some poison, and the trick actually works.  Fruits that grow on trees and take 30,000 years to ripen are shaped like newborn infants.  Goodness.  Some of these ideas may be tastless, but they're all definintely crazy.  Very impressive indeed.  Overall, this is a praiseworthy work that I have to unfortunately criticize simply for its length and repetitiveness.  I highly recommend an abridged version.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Revised-1/product-reviews/0226971325/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4
207,208,4,积极,0.13103692201518288,"I read this translation together with the Chinese original, the authoritative Renmin Wenxue Chuban Se edition (third edition, released in 2010). My overall impression is that this translation is well done. Prof Yu strives to translate every single character, so the minor flattening-out found in the Jenner version isn't found here. However, at the highest level of criticism, the translation lacks a little of the brio and fun found in Waley's highly abridged 'Monkey'. Yu's somewhat slavish adherence to the original text yields dividends, yet at the same time sacrifices a bit of the verve. I found myself preferring to read the Chinese despite it being more difficult (a feature of the somewhat abstruse vocabulary). Another point to note is that the original writer has a very wide vocabulary, which isn't that noticeable in Yu's translation (he tends to tone down some of the more difficult words). Nonetheless, Yu's version must remain the best translation of 'Journey to the West', though I won't say it's definitive like Moss Roberts' 'Three Kingdoms' version for 'Sanguo Yanyi'. What is really splendid about this edition is a lengthy and scholarly introduction which helps lay readers understand the Daoist and textual background of 'Xiyouji', and Yu's book may be recommendable for that alone.",https://www.amazon.com/Journey-West-Revised-1/product-reviews/0226971325/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4

Much better than many historical epics, in which everybody is just so darn EARNEST, this book inserts wit and a genuine (and gentle) understanding of human nature into an engrossing, and often deadly serious and menacing storyline.  Yu's translation is clear and lucid, and supports the action very nicely.  So many Asian epics are muddled (well, massacred, really) in translation that Yu's gifts are a breath of fresh air.

Sun Wu K'ung (the monkey king) is, without question, my favorite mythological character (even though, I really do believe he exists) and has been an inspiration for not only myself, but thousands (if not millions) of others who have read these wonderful stories.  In the first book, after the first monkey king story, it gets a little boring, as it tells the situations and geneology leading to the monk Tripitaka setting out on his quest and meeting Wu K'ung (who was trapped by the buddha after his assault on heaven), but overall, this is a story that is timeless.
