1,"Anyone who is familiar with the real literature work, knows it is voluminous .. These 'Real-Reads' little books seem to be the perfect way to install interest and curiosity among the younger generation, with a good balance of some illustrations between the text. For parents/adults it gives a great synopsis of an extensive book, so that they at least have some basic knowledge about the story line when mentioned in a conversation. I applaud the effort of these books, which also end with 'Food for thought/homework' assignments, making it ideal for a school project/educational setting.","https://www.amazon.com/The-Water-Margin/product-reviews/B00S9V6PVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

3,"The Water Margin (Shui Hu Zhuan) is one of the most surprising classics of Chinese literature. Many books in the west have portrayed Asia, and China in particular, as being a place where people blend in, go along to get along, or submit to authority out of Confucian filial piety. This is not one of those books. This book is a riot of rebellious violence, subversive vulgarity, bouyant indulgence and righteous indignation. It is a celebration of a society of individuals and their complex relationships.  The basic story follows a series of characters who for various reasons fall from grace with the powers that be, sometimes through no fault of their own, but often through their own rapacious appetites. They each find themselves pushed by a mix of circumstance and necessity, to the marshes of Mount Liang, where they unite to form a notorious gang of bandits, waging outright war against a corrupt bureaucracy.  As this novel defies stereotypes of  traditional Chinese culture, it also presents one of the most complex and ambivalent portraits of heroism in literature. The bandits in the Water Margin are not merely 'Robin Hood in China' though some that is stolen form the rich is indeed given to the poor, they are each complex individuals with their own motivations, often in contradiction with their comrades and themselves.  This translation, furthermore, is an excellent way to get to know the novel. Many earlier translations either bowdlerized or censored the more vulgar and ignoble content, or politicized the work, attempting to impose bland moral conformity on a work that's principle insight was the moral complexity of human beings. This translation restores the text to its original form, and updates translational conventions to modern standards.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
4,"Of course the underlying literary work is great; but did anyone else notice quite a few typographical and grammatical errors while reading this English language edition? Seems as though it suffers from the general lack of copy editing to which many digital age publications (of both new works and old) are prone.  I am not a Chinese literary scholar, so I can't speak to the quality of the translation or the editing of the abridged version. Nonetheless, the fairly frequent typos made it hard for me to trust the quality of this edition overall. I recently ordered the first volume of the Shapiro translation published by Foreign Languages Press in order to compare.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",3
5,"This is a very long but worthwhile book. It's not difficult to understand why, in Chinese tradition, 'The Water Margin' is considered one of the great Chinese books.  Whoever reads it will find a well conceived ethic, romance, violence, and nobility of spirit.  I found the Kindle format well suited to a book of this size. Scrolling and bookmarking, with the succinct explanatory notes, make this a very readable and easy to use book.  Despite some minor typographical errors, possibly OCR malfunctions, the book was never unintelligible, and deserves the five star rating I gave it.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
6,"This is a great translation of 水浒传 that was instantly engaging.

It is not an impenetrable jungle of Chinese names like 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' which I am finding difficult to read. 'Water Margin' is for me a 'kick back and enjoy' sort of book.

13,"The further i get in the book the more i question the real intentions of the author.

14,"One of the Chinese classics, this is at times a disturbing tale of a large group of bandits that, while they themselves are corrupt (constantly bribing people, killing opponents and their families), unite to fight even more corrupt local officials while pledging loyalty to the the most corrupt figure of all -- the emperor! There are many entertaining stories, however, and colorful characters. It's interesting that the current leader in China, Xi Jinping, said he 'admires' the bandit leader, Song Jiang. Perhaps it is because Song Jiang pledged unconditional loyalty to the Emperor.  I agree with other criticisms that the editing leaves something to be desired, which was a surprise considering how long this book has been in print and the number of revisions done.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",3

18,"This book, if translated differently, might have rated four or five stars, but I find it hard to believe that the translator is a native English speaker.  The book is rife with poor word choices typical of computerized translation or of someone using a Chinese-English dictionary without a good grasp of English.  Some areas are polished, and read very well; unfortunately these are what I read while browsing in the bookstore.  But many others left me puzzling over the poor word choices, and seriously detracted from both the flow of the novel and my enjoyment of it.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",2

20,"When I read this books approximately fifteen years ago, it astonished me with its beautiful story telling that cause addiction to it.  An eastern variant of Robin Hood story, only different in figures. If in original Robin Hood story,  Robin Hood was became central figure; but in Water Margin, there were 108 figures with different kinds of back grounds which represented 108 ancient eastern astrological signs.  It was telling a story about a band of heroes who fight against injustice of corrupted Song Court, under administration of prime minister Kao.  The fight was so dramatic to its detailed that making reader's heart to pound hardly.  Even this current version is still emanating the same light as previous read books.  If one of my friends like Robin Hood story, I will absolutely recommend The Water Margin since they will probably have a high chance to like it too.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
21,"After having read all of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, I do think Water Margin (Outlaws of the Marsh) is the weakest and the one I like the least.  In fact, it would be safe to say that I really disliked it.  Without going into too much details, I'd say that the characters in this book are a far cry from Robin Hood and his Merry Men that the back cover of this book tried to compare them to.  The protagonists left me disgusted and I found myself rooting for the supposed corrupt government for the most parts of the book.  By modern standards of morality, the Outlaws of the Marsh are nothing but outlaws.  They are cruel, crass, brutal hypocrites that claim to rebel against corrupt government and yet they demand grain from surrounding villages and basically sack any village that would not or could not comply.  To me, their actions are no different than the corrupt, oppressive government they claim to be rebelling against.  Any character that commits murder against innocents or women and children is considered a 'hero' as long as he knows another 'hero' that would vouch for how 'heroic' he is.  If that person didn't belong in their 'hero' club, he's branded a villain and would be murdered in the most barbaric ways possible.  There were also a couple of instances where the bandits framed innocent men and ruined their lives to the point that they had nowhere else to turn except to banditry.  If anyone refused to join the outlaws, they can expect to have their whole family - sometimes even the whole village - murdered by the bandits.  It's obvious to me, after reading this book, where the saying 'the young shouldn't read Outlaws of the Marsh' came from.  The main characters are hooligans and someone with an impressionable mind might follow in their footsteps since the book keeps on pressing on its readers how 'heroic' all these outlaws are and how 'righteous' their actions are.  But despite my negative opinions of the main characters, I am glad I read this book.  It is interesting to see how crimes committed today that would be considered abominable was viewed in a totally different light several hundreds of years ago.  The actual translation isn't great but it's readable.  I probably would have gone through the nearly 800 pages pretty fast if it weren't for the fact that I had to put down this book several times in disgust at the characters' actions.  The main problem  I have with the actual text is that it seems like it wasn't proofread (despite this being an updated edition) before being published.  Many typos, wrong or missing punctuations, and odd word usages aside, there was a glaring mistake in one of the earlier chapters when a woman was wrongly identified as 'The Night Witch', a character that actually wouldn't be introduced until about ten chapters later.  So sadly, I don't think a lot of care went into producing this book.  I also found out, after purchasing this version of the book, that there are other editions out there with around 100 chapters.  From what commentaries I found, most people didn't think the additional chapters made a huge difference to the story.  The chapters after 70 were about the outlaws falling in under the Emperor's rule and following his orders and some thought that wasn't interesting or important enough to include.  Nonetheless I wish I had gotten the complete version with all the chapters.  Why bother publishing a book if it's not going to include all that the author wrote?  It seems odd to just choose to publish the 70 chapters when there are more material out there.","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Classic-Classics/product-reviews/0804840954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",2
22,"This movie is only based on Chapters 64-68 of a Chinese novel called The Water Margin. I'm a fan of the Suikoden (Video Game) series, and it's loosely based and inspired on this tale, so it was a must watch for me.  If you're expecting the usual Shaw/Chang Cheh kung-fu movies, be warned this one's a little different. It's more story-oriented almost like a drama really. The fighting wasn't the best, but the characters/story had me interested enough to keep watching. David Chiang is great in this (minus the awkward fighting style), although many of the listed actors only get a few minutes of air time, if that even!  I think the movie simply being called 'The Water Margin' and being 2 hours long might maybe disappoint people who were hoping for a grand epic movie. This only tells a small part of the novel's storyline, so I think for what it is, it's a great movie!","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-David-Chiang/product-reviews/B01MQFMBXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
23,"One of the 1st kung fu flicks I ever saw (a double feature with Dragon Squad). Taken from the classic Chinese novel Outlaws of the Marsh, this epic Shaw Brothers production follows the story of vengeance, betrayal & chivalry. The Liang Shan heroes wants bloody revenge for the death of their brother Heavenly King at the hands of Golden Spear. The only one capable of dealing with him is the well respected Jade Unicorn. So the heroes put forth a plan to get him to join up with them but was thwarted by Jade Unicorn's adopted son The Prodigy. When his wife & servant sells him out to the authorities, a few escape attempts & plots to assassinate him lead up to the grand climax of a deadly showdown between the heroes & Golden Spear plus his disciples.  The Water Margin obviously is the best version of this film, given the 108 minutes of it. Whereas 7 Blows of the Dragon, the English dubbed version, is not even 90 minutes long & contains more nudity & cursing which us Westerners crave (being facetious of course). With this version, it makes sense of the deception & the conniving of Jade Unicorn's treacherous wife & the chief servant. It also includes Timely Rain's (one of the elders of the Liang Shan heroes) prison visit as well as why those 2 prison guards kept assisting Jade Unicorn.  All & all, the action was on par with the storyline. Plenty of weaponry & hand to hand fights. One of the major things that bothered me...as Chen Kuan Tai is in this movie, it's more like barely 5 minutes on screen. He's more present in the follow-up All Men are Brothers, but I just wondered why just a bit part in this one. Outside of that, it's more than what you're looking for in a film of this genre: action & a very good plot. If you're a fan then add this one to the must see list...","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-David-Chiang/product-reviews/B01MQFMBXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

32,"Students of Chinese looking for a high-quality print of Shuihu Zhuan (Water Margin, All Men Are Brothers) should try this edition from Beijing University. Tan Fan (East China Normal University) provides two kinds of glosses (printed in the oversize margins): stylistic and linguistic. The superscripts for the glosses are different, so you do not need to read the glosses to tell which are which. Unfortunately, the stylistic glosses dominate, and many obsolete expressions are not glossed. If you have a good historical dictionary of Chinese baihua literature, you can supply the deficiencies. There is enough white space in the margins to add some of your own glosses. The characters (simplified) are larger, darker, and more uniform than in cheap reprints. And the paper is higher quality (no see-through). The novel is split into two (somewhat oversize) paperback volumes. Binding is strong but flexible, and the book can be folded like a magazine while reading. You will need a solid surface if you record your own glosses. This is probably the best Shuihu for old eyes (anyone who needs reading glasses), even if it does not quite qualify as a 'big character' book. Tan surveys some of the many versions of the Shuihu in his introduction. This is the 100-chapter version from Ming Wanli 38 (1610).","https://www.amazon.com/Water-Margin-Outlaws-Marsh-Chinese/product-reviews/7301189397/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4
