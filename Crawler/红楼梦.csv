42,"Joly's was the first substantial translation of the classic Chinese novel 'Dream of the Red Chamber', now reissued by Tuttle, lightly revised (or so it seems). However - and this is a big however - while the translation is relatively free from major errors, it has a nauseatingly crabbed and archaic style which makes understanding a near-impossibility. The thous and whithers and whenceforths are not excised from this text. Now that we have the David Hawkes/John Minford Penguin translation and the Yangs' more literal version, Joly's version can safely be binned. If you are curious about this version, Joly's 56 chapters are all available at the Gutenberg website.","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804840962/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
43,"Truth in advertising should, I believe, dictate that potential buyers be aware of two issues with this book:  First, the book may have been recently published, but the translation goes back to two turns of the century ago.  That's not a bad thing, but the buyer should know that this is not even close to a recent translation.  Second, this book is not the whole book.  It actually contains less than half of 'The Dream of the Red Chamber,' and abruptly breaks off leaving the reader suspended with nowhere to go.  That's not necessarily bad either if only we were told that this was the case, but we are not.  If you want the whole story, this is not the book for you.","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804840962/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",2
44,"What an exceptional little book. It is apparently a 'Real Reads' series, which I had not previously heard of. The website ([...] states the books are 'retellings of great literature from around the world, each fitted into a 64-page book.' The books themselves are paperback (I see they also are available on Audible), but what a lovely paperback, with a book cover, thick, thick paper and charming illustrations. Other features that I enjoyed were a list of characters (which I did use quite often) and in the back, there is a 'Taking Things Further' section. This section expands on the original book, followed by a section of questions and such, that one could use for a book club or more in-depth study. Also included here is a mid-nineteenth century illustraction by Chinese artist Sun Wen. What a lovely book to introduce young readers to great liturature.  It is timeless Chinese storytelling, with all the haunting beauty, drama and heartache. This may be a bit of a challange for younger readers as there are instances of suicide, domestic violence, drunkenness, murder and adultry. These displays of behavior are not detailed and if one is old enough to read Shakespeare, then this book would also be appropriate, I imagine.  I am ashamed to admit, I have not read the original which is one of China's four great classic novels. I therefore cannot say how well this abridged copy captures the 2000 or so page original. What I can state, is that this shortened story is still beautiful, detailed and sadly haunting. It is probably one of those books that every learned child should read. It gives insight to Chinese history and culture in a compact but entertaining dose. It piqued my interest enough that I put the unabridged english version on my 'to read' list. I would have loved this in junior high after we read Romeo and Juliet. It would have been a interesting comparison in cultures.  Disclosure: I read a free copy of the book in return for my candid review. Be assured, my opinion is honest, and I do not owe or know the author/publisher.","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804840962/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",2
45,"'Dream of the Red Chamber' is an 18th century Chinese tale that appears light and imaginative at first masking a heavy dose of reality. It tells the story of Baoyu, man in love with his talented and fragile cousin Daiyu, a penniless young woman who depends on his family for support. As time passes their love grows deeper as does his family's ambitions and they connive to marry him to Baochai, a capable, healthy and considerate woman.  The story depicts traditions in the Chinese culture from the appearance and mannerisms of the characters clearly depicted in colourful drawings to the life and social structure of the aristocracy. The female characters are capable, determined and conniving in their struggle for authority, their hatred, jealousies and conspiracies, while the men appear cold ruled by duty rather than their hearts. It is a story that starkly contrasts love and duty and a woman's rights and responsibilities. Even with the beauty of the writer's artistry, there is a bleakness and lack of hope within its pages, where a family's fortunes are controlled by the government and can be taken in a blink of an eye,a woman is allowed to suffer under her husband's tyranny, and even a man's marriage is manipulated for gain.  This short story considered a Chinese classic I found to memorable and well-worth reading; an excellent addition to a library","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tuttle-Classics/product-reviews/0804840962/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4

48,"There is no denying that Dream of Red Mansions (Hong Lou Meng) is an important piece of Chinese literature. However, I did not really enjoy this book. I found the characters to be frustrating and the pace slow. Although this is the abridged version, it is still extremely long and not an easy read. I can't imagine how long reading the unabridged version would take.  Although I did not enjoy reading this book, it is a critical piece of Chinese literature. The book moves slowly through various episodes in Jia Biaoyu and Lin Diayu's life, demonstrating a new type of novel - the 'chain-link' novel that could be read by the masses. The book also gives insight to Chinese culture. While not my personal taste, this is a good book for those studying Chinese literature.","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Mansions-Tsao-Hsueh-Chin/product-reviews/0887271782/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4

51,"A continuation of David Hawkes' beautiful translation of the amazing 18th century Chinese novel begun in Volume I (The Golden Days).  This book conveys the immersive feel of entering another culture and another era--it's family structure, etiquette, philosophy, clothing, gardens, poetry, entertainments, rites of passage, sexual mores, and the innumerable small details that bring a culture fully to life. The dialogue continues to sparkle Some chapters have us laughing aloud, others make us feel we have been punched in the gut.  Much of this volume concerns the poetry club that the main protagonist and his young female family members and their maids in attendance have established in the garden of their mansion. So in some ways not a lot happens in terms of what one can call 'plot.'  And in other ways, everything--life--unfolds.  We get to experience the life of the Jia family and their relatives at the height of their success, before their inevitable decline.  This is, after all, Buddhist China, and in Buddhism, everything is about transience.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-known-Dream-Chamber/product-reviews/B00OVM4KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
52,"It's kinda silly how much I loved reading this, when spoiled Chinese aristocrats writing poetry really ought to be boring. But then a scene comes along like Bao-chai and Dai-yu exchanging insults disguised as jokes, and Tan-chun speaks up:  'Pinch her lips, Chai!' she said. 'You should hear what she's been saying about you.' 'I don't need to,' said Bao-chai. 'One doesn't expect ivory from a dog's mouth!'  And I literally said out loud, 'Woof, girl!' and kept on chugging along.  Sure, I did miss the really weird parts of Volume I. So much nothing happens in this second volume. But that's okay, because there are also some tremendously tender moments of affection. Bao-yu doting on his maids to keep them warm; Xi-feng and Patience rigging a card game so Grandmother can win; Or Dai-yu taking Caltrop under her wing and making a real poet out of her. For all the back-biting these women and men in the Jia family do, they also express deep love in small, subtle ways.  --But, boy, there's also some sudden and violent bursts of life in between. People die or get beaten within an inch of death, and we just move on to the next scene. Constantly moving on forward and forward, with a little growing tinge of melancholy left behind in the background. And it's that satisfying mix of fantasy, realism, sweetness, and godawful depression that makes me corny in love for this story.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-known-Dream-Chamber/product-reviews/B00OVM4KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
53,"Compared to other translations of this book, this is by far the easiest, most comprehensible, and most fluid flowing translation out there. Even though it is an English translation, the translation captures the original's intent and purpose, without too much verbosity.  And what makes this translation stand out is its inclusion of an appendix that discusses in depth relevant historical facts that the reader may find useful or interesting as they read the novel.  One complaint, the poems are not beautifully crafted and a lot of the original's subtle beauties are lost in translation. Both of these complaints are understandable. It is impossible to bring the greatness of this novel in its entirely from one language to another without losses. Though, It is a little sad not being able to fully absorb and enjoy everything the original has to offer. One possible solution, learn Chinese well enough to read the original in its mother language.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-known-Dream-Chamber/product-reviews/B00OVM4KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4
54,"Reviewers often comment on this volume being completely immersive in the minutiae of the daily rituals of the ladies and their maids. I have completely lost myself in this book in the way that I see others reading 'Twilight' or 'Fifty Shades of Grey' - I have stopped calling and emailing loved ones, and I have stolen more time than possible at work to read this as an ebook. This volume primarily concerns a gilded year at the Rong-Guo mansion. With the Prospect Garden's original purpose nullified (the imperial concubine has no visits scheduled for at least the next year and a half), Bao-yu and all the girls move in and devote themselves to poetry and day long entertainments consisting of crab, rice wine, painting, riddles, actors, and firecrackers. Behind the scenes there is infighting among the maids and tears all around. It's remarkable how easy it is to keep track of the hundreds of characters, but this volume of the novel benefitted from extensive rewriting, while future volumes are often made obscure by inconsistencies from draft to draft. Having read a drastically abridged version twenty years ago, and having seen the two Shaw Brothers film adaptations (1962 and 1978), I am most impressed by what a nice guy Bao-yu is. I previously thought of him as a spoiled and impetuous brat, but the unabridged version shows how sensitive he is to the needs of his female cousins and maids, whom he treats as his equal. He's charming in his devotion to others, especially when he is late for Xi-feng's disastrous birthday party because he is busy saying prayers for her on the outskirts of town. I marveled at Xi-feng's industrious nature in the first volume, but how quickly she became vain and greedy! I love how the lesser maids talk to her in a way that both flatters her but does not conceal their contempt for her amongst themselves. We have master translator David Hawkes for preserving the subtle intentions of such skillful language. Toward the end we get brought back to reality, first with the dramatic conclusion to Xi-feng's birthday which ends with complete exposure of her marital woes and her beating her maid Precious, her only true confidante. The highest ranking servants benefit greatly from their proximity to their masters, but they are also the first to suffer when something happens. Xi-feng and Lian's marriage is an interesting portrayal of marriage in the ruling class. The wives have to bear the brunt of the work and the burden of their husbands' infidelities, while the servants have to hold secrets or incur their masters' wrath. Another example of the excellent writing and translation: we are always aware of the pecking order in any situation. One more compliment to the translation, we have Chinese names for the ruling family, English translations for the servants (Aroma, Precious, Faithful, Skybright), and French names for the actors (Charmante, Élégante). This helps me keep track of everyone. In this volume we are more privy to the thoughts of major characters such as Bao-yu and Dai-yu, of course, and Aroma, Granny Liu, Precious, Xi-feng, Grandmother and Bao-chai. We continue to see the emotional hardship in the private lives of the maids, such as Aroma's dilemma of whether to return to her family or stay and try to guide Bao-yu to adulthood. We also see the desperation of old women like Granny Liu and Nanny Li, though Granny Liu also has a great few chapters that are among my favorite. I was not prepared for her drunken walk of wonderment around the garden. And after seeing Bao-yu's father exhibit the desire to fit in with the women of the family (particularly his unresponsive mother) during the riddle games of chapter 22, we see him revert back to his worst impulses in chapter 33, giving Bao-yu the beating that is usually one of the big scenes in any of the film adaptations. As unfair and sad as that situation was, I was almost moved to tears reading the touching scene between Dai-yu and Bao-chai when convalescent Dai-yu admitted her own shortcomings and realized that Bao-chai is actually a good friend. So beautifully written! And I was reading with bated breath as the ill Skybright summoned her strength to darn Bao-yu's cape with peacock thread when no one else would try - how does a writer get someone to feel suspense over a thing like darning? This volume ends in a good spot: Cousin Zhen explains how little money is coming in to the Ning-guo house but it is not serious yet. Then he lays out how even less money is coming in to the Rong-guo house and that they have had to start dipping into their capital to pay for all their expenditures! He doesn't even know how much they've been spending, but we do: paying off Golden's family following her suicide, building the Prospect Garden, buying painting supplies for Xi-chun to make paintings of the garden, a mass influx of Xing/Xue/Wang in-laws, huge outlays for parties, including foolishness such as bringing in an acting troupe from the outside even though they have one staying there! Ultimately, what is it all for? (SPOILERS AHEAD) Very few outsiders show up for the Rong-guo house's New Year's bash, either due to embarrassment for being poor, illness/old age, or dislike of Xi-feng.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-known-Dream-Chamber/product-reviews/B00OVM4KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

65,"This review applies to the first three volumes of this story. This is a typical Chinese fable  involving hundreds of characters. It follows the growth and interactions of a large well to do family and it's branches. This in itself makes it difficult to keep track of each one but it is made even more difficult because each character is referred to by more than one name. Their given name, their relationship name ( Auntie Xue..) and their nickname. Aside from that the storyline is rather mundane and does not move along at a satisfying pace. But the biggest complaint is the translation, I have read other Chinese fables and have found them a satisfying read however this translator seems to have written his own tale. And it is done more as an English Victorian tale in words and phrases rather than a Chinese fable.And in his lengthy introductions he admits he has taken liberties with the earlier manuscripts and translations. His language is not at all reminiscent of other Chinese translations in use of words or idioms . While there are more volumes left to read I will not go beyond the first 3.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-known-Dream-Chamber/product-reviews/B00OVM4KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
66,"* A Non-Chinese reader should beware of the fact that no matter how good 'Dream of Red Chamber' is translated into English, the gap between English & Chinese original is still huge, for several reasons: 1. The language Cao used is not the Mandarin that Chinese are using today, they were more subtle, superb, to the degree that author is capable to densify and enliven a whole paragraph in English into several sentences. (I will take some examples later...) 2. Cao was born from a noble family, he was well trained in Ancient Chinese Philology, Prosody, Rhetoric, thus the gamut of knowledge and references cause huge problems not only for Western Scholars (which are very few), but also Eastern Stone-Scholars. 3. The vissicitude of Cao's family is unimaginable to a modern reader, the richness of language, emotion and situation in which the author wrote this book render more subtlety than modern readers can fathom and writers alike to apply. 4. Too many puns, quibbles, word plays and moods of Chinese poetry are heavily distorted by both English and translator, and the names Cao gave to the characters always 'imply' something: Jia BaoYu (贾宝玉）implies 'precious jade', Lin DaiYu （林黛玉），黛 had several meanings, it can be used to describe a beauty, green color or the the material women used to draw eyebrows, of course it's an extremely feminine Chinese character for women. Xue BaoChai (薛宝钗）implies 'precious hairpin', Etc.... I am distraught by the fact that the translator never mentioned on this. * I will take one paragraph from Chapter 27 in Volume II, if you don't understand Chinese, you can compare the length of them. 紫鹃雪雁素日知道林黛玉的情性 ：无事闷坐 ，不是愁眉 ，便是泪眼 ，且好端端的不知为了什么 ，常常的便自泪自叹的 。先时还有人解劝 ，或怕他思父母 ，想家乡 ，受了委曲 ，只得用话宽慰解劝 。谁知后来一年一月的竟常常的如此 ，把这个样儿看惯 ，也都不理论了 。所以也没人理 ，由他去闷坐 ，只管睡觉去了 。那林黛玉倚着床栏杆 ，两手抱着膝 ，眼睛含着泪 ，好似木雕泥塑的一般 ，直坐到二更多天方才睡了 。一宿无话 。至次日乃是四月二十六日 ，原来这日未时交芒种节 。尚古风俗 ：凡交芒种节的这日 ，都要设摆各色礼物 ，祭饯花神 ，言芒种一过 ，便是夏日了 ，众花皆卸 ，花神退位 ，须要饯行 。然闺中更兴这件风俗 ，所以大观园中之人都早起来了 。那些女孩子们 ，或用花瓣柳枝编成轿马的 ，或用绫锦纱罗叠成旄尾执事的 ，都用彩线系了 。每一颗树上 ，每一枝花上 ，都系了这些物事 。满园里绣带飘飖 ，花枝招展 ，更兼这些人打扮得桃羞杏让 ，燕妒莺惭 ，一时也道不尽 。 Nightingale and Snowgoose had long since become habituated to Dai- yu's moody temperament; they were used to her unaccountable fits of depression, when she would sit, the picture of misery, in gloomy silence broken only by an occasional gusty sigh, and to her mysterious, perpetual weeping, that was occasioned by no observable cause. At first they had tried to reason with her, or, imagining that she must be grieving for her parents or that she was feeling homesick or had been upset by some unkindness, they would do their best to comfort her. But as the months lengthened into years and she still continued exactly the same as before, they gradually became accustomed and no longer sought reasons for her behaviour. That was why they ignored her on this occasion and left her alone to her misery, remaining where they were in the outer room and continuing to occupy themselves with their own affairs. She sat, motionless as a statue, leaning against the back of the bed, her hands clasped about her knees, her eyes full of tears. It had already been dark for some hours when she finally lay down to sleep. Our story passes over the rest of that night in silence. Next day was the twenty- sixth of the fourth month, the day on which, this year, the festival of Grain in Ear was due to fall. To be precise, the festival's official commencement was on the twenty- sixth day of the fourth month at two o'clock in the afternoon. It has been the custom from time immemorial to make offerings to the flower fairies on this day. For Grain in Ear marks the beginning of summer; it is about this time that the blossom begins to fall; and tradition has it that the flower- spirits, their work now completed, go away on this day and do not return until the following year. The offerings are therefore thought of as a sort of farewell party for the flowers. This charming custom of `speeding the fairies' is a special favourite with the fair sex, and in Prospect Garden all the girls were up betimes on this day making little coaches and palanquins out of willow- twigs and flowers and little banners and pennants from scraps of brocade and any other pretty material they could find, which they fastened with threads of coloured silk to the tops of flowering trees and shrubs. Soon every plant and tree was decorated and the whole garden had become a shimmering sea of nodding blossoms and fluttering coloured streamers. Moving about in the midst of it all, the girls in their brilliant summer dresses, beside which the most vivid hues of plant and plumage became faint with envy, added the final touch of brightness to a scene of indescribable gaiety and colour. * Thus for those who think this book is greatly written, you are right, but the original one is incomparably more gorgeous.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-known-Dream-Chamber/product-reviews/B00OVM4KW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",2

Anthony Yu is willing to take on the broad community of scholars to make his particular points of emphasis and in Re-Reading I feel he especially allows for a closer sympathy to the characters of the novel and their engagement with their own destinies.

70,"This is one of the most interesting and profound novels I have read, a masterpiece of Chinese literature and a world class contribution. I genuinely enjoyed this translation of this 250-year old novel. The text flowed well and was clear and understandable.  The Preface was well-written and extremely helpful to understanding this novel and the provenance of the text. Note that the original author had died after completing the first 80 chapters, and a different author made up the concluding 40 chapters. Those last 40 chapters were clearly not up to par, both in terms of literary quality, and in sticking to the character, spirit, and plot trajectory of the original novel. I therefore decided to stop reading at chapter 82 in Vol. 5. The original 80 chapters are a masterpiece however. The poetry therein stands out of itself as great literature. The descriptions and characterization are so realistic you feel as if you have known those people and places for years. I would say this is a must-read!  I am studying Chinese and but my reading is not good enough to be able to read the original of this famous classic novel.  What I really liked about this edition was having Chinese and English face to face, which helps me practice reading my Chinese.  The English translation is generally good - it is easily readable, yet sticks closely to the Chinese original.  It is not exact in some cases, especially when it comes to some of the names.  Endnotes explain the meaning of the Chinese names, but there's relatively few of them so they don't disrupt the flow of the text.  The 6 volumes are thick and heavy, and we are treated to a full page illustration in the style of Chinese painting every other chapter.  That's about 60 paintings.  The reason I give it a star less is the prevalence of typos.  You're likely to encounter one every page or every few pages.  Most were obvious and easy to correct, but it was rather annoying.  A little more quality control in the typesetting would have helped.","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4

74,"Romanization schemes for Chinese are notoriously imperfect, if for no other reasons than that 4 tones -- 5 if you count a null tone sometimes used -- are not immediately obvious to those who do not have a speaking knowledge of any of the Chinese dialects.  Perhaps I am prejudiced, having learned Chinese primarily using texts that happened to (mostly) rely on the Pinyin system.  However, it seems to me that Pinyin has the distinct merit of adhering most closely to the principles of most of the primary European languages (especially Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages) where vowel sounds are far more regular and predictable than they are in English, particularly.  I can't comment (yet) on this particular translation, though I am working through several other bilingual editions that are part of the same Foreign Language Press publication project, and can give a few early impressions based on what I've read so far.  These translations are commendable in that they seek to provide a full translation of the works in question, thereby attempting to avoid some of the cultural 'hyperbole' that has been attached to some of these works by translators approaching the texts from outside the context of Chinese culture.  As a native-born speaker of English, I did not begin studying Chinese until my late teens and will never have the complete understanding of the culture to argue persuasively over the finer points of these translations.  However, on the intuitive side, I do not a certain defensiveness at times and an effort to provide translations that are either culturally acceptable to present-day political realities in the Chinese mainland regions, or that may simply be dodging some of the tougher editorial calls to be made.  It is very clear, especially in some of the introductory matter that accompanies many texts in this series, that the final English version was approved by someone not a native speaker of idiomatic English.  In most cases, the evidence appears in simple errors of literal translation of phrases that make perfect idiomatic sense in Chinese, but, rendered with too much literal faithfulness, are puzzling to say the least when they are rendered in English.  I would agree with others who've commented that these texts are probably best for someone whose knowledge of Chinese is limited and is looking for an English 'crib sheet' for entering into the Chinese originals (or in some cases, modern Chinese renditions of Classical Chinese texts, as in FLP's 2 volume translation of the works of Zhuangzi).  Note, however, that the FLP translation of Zhuangzi is (unless I'm mistaken) the most complete translation presently available in English, and this is true of many other texts in the FLP's publishing project).  As a student of Chinese language, I really don't care much what romanization method is used.  They are all far from ideal.  What I care about is that someone is making these texts available in English, even if the translations are not always the most poetic -- where poetry is called for.","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4

76,"I've stumbled upon an abbreviated version of this book, which contained only 500 pages, and I've so fallen in love with it that I had to purchase the whole rendering, which amounts to almost 2000 pages. There are two fully unabridged translations, and this one is simply excellent. Unlike some other reviewers I find the English language here more than adequate, and the style more than satisfactory, doing honor to the unique original book, I'm sure. The story takes place in old China, describing the life of a young nobleman,- inspired by the author's only son who died young,- his rich background, his loves and disappointments, all that in a mystical way yet with the most elaborated accent on the noble family's daily-life. There are no words to describe the fascination,- the aesthetic appeal that looms from every page,- the garden-scenes which get names in the form of short poems (not unlike the Haiku and Tanka traditional Japanese poems, probably inspired by this Chinese tradition). Reading this book makes the reader actually earn a PHD on the classical Chinese culture of 200-300 years ago, including their costumes, their habits,- (burying faded flowers, crying over them,- can there be anything more touching,- and charming?), their political plots,- the family described being that of noble people who serve the Emperor,- the differences between the masters and the servants, their foods, their sicknesses and cures. You walk with the heroes in their exquisite gardens, full of artificial mountains, brooks, bridges, and of course exotic trees and flowers, you breathe the typical scents, get acquainted with their daily life, the ranks of importance inside the family, (the old widowed grandmother being like their queen, entitled to beat her grownup sons with a cane...) the strict rules of courtship and marriage, their strange illnesses and remedies. Moreover, since the Chinese used to believe in tangible Gods and Goddesses, the other world mixes invariably with this life, and dreams can be simply visits beyond the clouds. Just like Shakespeare, this author too brings ghosts, Gods, magic spells and items into the plots, making the reader swim in the book as if inside the huge brain of interlaced heaven and earth, feasting on both interchangeably. Then come the intricate plots, many of them, interwoven in each other, each one a little drama in the best Shakespearean style, people living and dying for jealousy, envy, greed, treachery, chastity, love,- not unlike Romeo and Juliet, not Italian but Chinese. This book is simply unique, a marvel of beauty, tragedies, exultations, all discovered on each page. Maybe I should simply say that it's the most beautiful book I've ever read. Mind you, I have nothing to do with China, so I am impartial. Recommended with 50 stars out of 5!!! Enjoy!!!By the way it's been one of the 10 bestsellers of all times. So, I'm not alone.

91,"This book is like Anna Karenina in the following ways: Both are masterpieces of epic proportions. Both are considered contenders for being the greatest works of fiction in their respective languages. Both deal with large, upper class families and the lifestyle and intrigue involved. Both are works of realism and paint a complete picture of a society. A Dream of Red Mansions focuses on the love between Baoyu, an unusual child in his early teens who is temperamental and spends most of his time with the girls in the family mansion and Daiyu, a delicate, sensitive and yet witty and extremely clever girl. The two grow up as children and live in the same mansion but the family does not hurry to marry them off as they have other plans for Baoyu. This is the main thread that runs through the novel's amazing 120 chapters. The other sublots are very numerous - there are hundreds - but none of them are sustained for the whole book. The main part of the book is the set of characters. Again there are hundreds but a few main ones which become the most interesting in this drama. There's the conniving Xifeng, Baoyu's strict father, Baoyu's assertive 'other love' Baochai and the like. Unlike Anna Karenina, this book is full of humour, jokes and poems (which was where I think the translation failed the most as Chinese poetry rendered into English seems to lose the plot!). It contains moments of great sadness but also wit and quirkiness. There's been controversy with the amazon reviews of this particular translation. I don't speak Chinese so can't judge it but reading the text, it seemed fine. I guess if I saw another or the original it would change my mind but this one isn't too bad. The novel deals with so many topics that you really get an overview of what life in 18th century upper class urban China was about. It is VERY long but it's amazing how in relating heaps and heaps of seemingly trivial incidents you grow to love many of the characters. It's like most novels are like meeting someone and hence only seeing what they want to show while this novel is like living with them. And trivialities aside, it's very moving. A must for all interested in Chinese society or who don't mind persevering through 1200 pages to read a one of the world's unusual and amazing dynasty chronicles and love stories.","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5
92,"There are two complete, unabridged translation of the greatest Chinese classical novel of manners 'Dream of the Red Chamber'.  One is the Penguin classics version translated by Oxford doyen David Hawkes and his son-in-law John Minford, now available on paperbacks in 5 volumes under the alternate title 'The Story of the Stone'.  The other is this China Foreign Language Press version made in the late 1970s by Chinese translators Yang Xianyi and his wife Gladys.  With all due respects to the Yangs, their translation just isn't on par with the Penguin's.  The original novel is a paragon of how the classical vernacular Chinese language should be written; Yangs' version is stodgy and half-hearted and captures none of the elegance and depth of the original.  Their English borders on paraphrase at times and they don't appear to bother about stylistic recreation, eg. some sentences don't sound native at all - 'The arrival of the edict rejoiced the hearts of all officials'.  Believe me, reading the original is much, much better.  The Yangs' works could be serviceable (as in their decent Lu Hsun) but this version of 'Dream of the Red Mansions' is embarassingly outclassed by a far superior and more idiomatic rendition: David Hawkes's version is simply unparalleled and a labor of love.

93,"Let it be said first that this translation is probably all a translation should be, ie extremely readable. In fact I wish the English of many modern novelists were as readable as the one in this book. Alas, this classic suffers from the same problem that plagues other Chinese classics -- like 'Water Margin' aka 'Outlaws from the Marsh' which I attempted to read as well -- namely it is impossible to keep track of characters. In the first 50 pages it is fair to say each page introduces at least 2 fresh characters! Of course most of these disappear never to reappear but the result is that you can't relate to individual characters, nor even to a set cast of characters. This problem is so bad here that reading the book like a succession of (very) short stories won't work either. I suspect this problem has partly to do with the transcription of names into romanized alphabet. The name 'Li-Cheng' means nothing in English while in Chinese it can be written in many different ways according to the choice of pictograms(many pictograms being available to translate the same sound). That's why a woman may be named 'Li-You' which may mean Spring-Blossom, Gentle-Breeze etc. The upshot is that the Chinese reader will see and relate to specific Chinese pictograms with their own syllabic meaning and graphical aesthetics, and he will be able to keep names separate in his mind, while the English reader with be stuck with a (meaningless) 'Li-You' (which looks nearly identical to another, equally meaninless 'Li-Yi' two paragragraphs further down). This is compounded by the fact tha 'Li-You' maybe female or male, 'Li' by no means limited to either sex. I suggest translators of this type of litterature should repeat forms of addresses like 'Mr Li-You' or 'Boy Li-you' througout  regardless of whether such distinctions are repeated in the original. Maybe an abridged version of such a classic, with a selection of main characters, would be enough for beginning readers. After all the work is huge, it could survive some pruning. For my part I'll give Chinese classics a break.","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",3
94,"The Debt of Tears refers to Lin Daiyu's plaintive, obdurate settlement of her debt with fate and her surrender to lonely circumstances of death. Events in this despondent installment afford layers in increasing intensity of poignancy that presage Lin Daiyu's death and Baoyu's erroneous marriage to Bao-chai at the insistence of the Jias.  The volume begins with an ailing Lin Daiyu dreaming a bad dream that confronts her pent-up fear and fevered mind. Like a rope on a pulley Daiyu's hopes and fears spin up and down with sighs and tears. Her health takes a huge toll and deteriorates drastically. The critical nature of her condition both alarms and frightens the maids who for fear of Baoyu's lapsing into delirium decides to conceal from him. While Daiyu harbors an acute sense of insecurity being an outsider in the Jias mansion and broods about being at the mercy of the Jias, the family deliberately reconsiders the auspicious match between jade and the golden locket. Baochai is crowned with praise for having the aplomb of someone twice her age. Her virtuous disposition finds favor in the eyes of all the ladyships. As the Jias frantically prepare for the wedding without Daiyu's knowing, the delicate frowner happens to eavesdrop the news and plunges into utter mortification. The prophecy contained in her nightmare is to be duly fulfilled after all. Bitterness and grief overwhelm her to the point that she conceives the only way to escape is death. She is determined to undermine her health and seizes her fate.  The marriage between Baoyu and Baochai is an unfortunate mistake. It is an unexpected outcome of an incidence that should have otherwise favored Daiyu and spared her death. The sudden disappearance of Baoyu's jade, ponders Daiyu, nullifies the bond of gold and jade. But little does Daiyu realize that the loss of the jade on which Baoyu's life hinges causes the Jias to panic. The family resorts to hurry the wedding between Baoyu and Baochai to turn Baoyu's luck and rally his spirits. This paradox of the lost jade expounds the mysterious vagaries of destiny, the joy and pathos of life. Over the top of the hurly-burly of the Jias family life, there hangs the consistent reminder of some transcendental existence. Somehow the cycle of life is totally out of our calculation and grip. The wheel of karma is what inevitably governs the cycle of life and the human soul is only playing out a predetermined role. Life doesn't end at death for death is merely dispersion.  The bitter end of the tragic story of love between Baoyu and Daiyu throws the former into a delirium. What follows would be a significant theme Cao Xueqin intends for the novel, elements that take on a greater emphasis than ever after Daiyu's death: Baoyu's enlightenment and disenchantment, the seeing through of red lust, and finally the abjuring of the world.","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5

96,"'A Dream of Red Mansions' is a story focusing on a high spiritual love story that happened in a noble family, but what it wants to speak is much far beyond a love story theme. The author's attempt is to depict a macro-viewed picture which leads us to the very deep insight of life itself in complexity and profoundity, and not another Chinese classic writer have been more successful at doing this than him. From innocent to sophisticated, from prosperous to desolate, from enthusiastic to disillusioned; a dream losing at some moment of life course could have been anyone of us' experience, even though we are not nobles. Because of the dream losing, we grew up. After growing up, a decision needs to be made for our lifestyle. Usually we make the decision not only at our own will, some other matters must be considered such as the expectation, pressure, and restriction from family (elders) and society, as well as the advantages they might offer us. So, most of us would go for the social mainstream. Only a few become malcontents by their nature and personalities. And it is the way where the character the book is centered at, Baoyu, put his fate toward on.  However, though Baoyu is unusual, his malcontent spirit was not awakened until he went through some unfortunate events, including the family's decline and the death of his beloved, Daiyu. So he is not a hero but another ordinary person. Like him, every character in 'A Dream of Red Mansions' is ordinary, even they are perhaps attractive, strong-willed, kindhearted, or smart enough, not an exception to Daiyu, the most poetic, sentimental, and highly spiritual girl in the book. That is one of the reasons the readers always love this book so much, since all the characters have been fully humanized by the author's genius writing, they are not the fictional figures only, but like the real people living around us everyday.  The love story between Baoyu and Daiyu is some kind of an inevitable tragedy, because Daiyu is naturally a tragic person. Not only her orphan background, her sensitivity and self-defense, but her purity and dignity, made her hard to find a proper room to live on in the society she lives, probably not even today's. She died at a young age, and the death itself is a tragedy, but what if she did not die young? Sadly, no other ending it would have been but another tragedy for her to keep growing old and living in the earthly world. Her unique character made the source of suffering to her love relationship with Baoyu, but Baoyu's spiritual life could only have been fulfilled by this relationship, because of her incorruptible soul beauty. She is his only soul mate, even though her love never made him peaceful. So to speak, their love story is some kind of an inevitable tragedy. Her death caused a painful impact to him, and brought him to a very deep thought about life's meaning. He realized there is always something beyond our control no matter how hard we try, that's destiny; nothing we can do but be humble while we face something relating to the destiny. Consequently, some power derived from this losing and realizing process pushed him toward another lifestyle. At end, he chose becoming a monk, retiring from the mundaneness, including his responsibilities to the family and society. It might make the readers sad, but it is not a tragedy since it is a choice made after spiritual awakening.  A decision making after we realize something in question will lead us on the proper way to the proper lifestyle suiting us well. Every one may have a different choice from another's after going through some disillusion, we don't necessarily follow Baoyu, but we are still touched by his story. This is another great achievement the author made for 'A Dream of Red Mansions'; he presented a life picture every reader can apply part of it to his own life. It is a very universal human subject that will never fade away all the times.","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5
97,"Even though some may say that the translation is less then brilliant I still enjoyed the story very much. I was quiet sad actually when the story ended. It made me feel like no other book had ever made me feel. I've always cheered on the good guys like in 'Outlaws of the Marsh' or 'The Three Kingdoms', but this time I really cared about these characters. Shakespeare's got nothing on this story. The charcters expressed the way they felt through poetry and music. I was in the room and I knew these people. It accomplishes everything every other story never could.

105,"i have not read a different translation of this book by a different translator. this is not a typical review but a comment about the method of translation, pinyin. and i, with difficulty, have not finished reading. here's why:  if you are an english speaking person, or english educated you will have difficulty in pronouncing chinese names of places and people romanized by the pinyin method.  the pinyin method is only immediately/'instinctively' useable for the chinese speaking/reading person tongued with foreknowledge.  to a non-chinese speaking/reading person pinyin is pinyin-hell. because you *never* know how to say it in 4 or 5 different ways.  even if you have heard how one pinyin name is correctly pronounced you are still guessing when you come across names spelt similarly.  then, for the uninitiated, there is hope to be found in a set of 'pinyin rules' (over 30 - oh joy!) where by one can amuse oneself with, repetitively, before embarking on reading pinyin books.  these rules are quite 'un-natural' or to put in kindly - foreign - to the english-speaking tongue.  here are a few taken from the web:  q  Consonant 'ch' as in  cheek  u  Vowels 'oo' as in  too  ue  Diphthong as 'i' in  ship  ui  Diphthong pronounced as  wee  v  Consonant used only to pronounce foreign words  The Chinese have great difficulty pronouncing the V.  w  Consonant as in  want  x  Consonants 'sh' as in  she  y  Consonant as in  yet  z  Consonant as in  zero  zh  Consonant 'j' as in  jump  most pinyin-translations do not provide such a list of rules or coach readers in this matter, or explain how it is suppose to work.  again from the web:  Putonghua (mandrin) , the national dialect has four tones. The Cantonese dialect has the most, with nine. In the four tones of putonghua , the word 'ma'  The first tone (flat) 'ma' in means 'mother.'  The second tone (rising) 'ma' can mean 'numb' or 'hemp.'  The third tone 'ma' the voice dips and then rises, means 'horse.'  The fourth tone 'ma' starts high and falls abruptly, means 'to scold.'  did that clarify the rules or compounded the difficulty?  frustrations runs high and runs often. everytime a pinyin name comes up i cringe which is like every other sentence.  for the casual reader, how close or by what degree it agree with the original language is hardly the key to successful reading or its enjoyment. if you seriously want to learn all the subtle tones i suggest you take up mandrin reading and writing - and then find the original version and enjoy that!","https://www.amazon.com/Mansions-Library-Chinese-Classics-Volumes/product-reviews/7119024116/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4",3

They follow the stone as it falls into the hands of the spoiled and effeminate youngest son of a powerful clan, Pao Yu Chia, sometimes intervening in events.  The Chias are a very rich and powerful Mandarin family, unaware that their actions will soon lead them into financial and moral ruin.  The story is complemented and complicated by the intermingled storyline of Pao Yu Chia's evil twin, Pao Yu Chen.  The Dream may be read on many levels: a love story, a social history, a philosophical musing on the futility of human existence, or a repository of Chinese artistic and literary values.  The story provides a picture of courtly aristocratic life in the Qing dynasty.  It reveals the hierarchies among the female family members and concubines and among the female servants, which result in numerous intrigues and machinations.  This story shows how having multiple wives can create many more hazards than pleasures--certainly for the wives, as they vy for power, enact revenge, and create or endure manipulative schemes. Among both the men and the women characters, the plot is filled with ridiculous squabbles and misunderstandings that sometimes are just farcical, but other times end in lawsuits or even tragedy.  The elaborate protocol used in a courtly residence to create 'face' also often causes unintended slights or misinterpretations that cause a loss of face instead.  Then the story focuses on the characters' social gymnastics to undue the damage. Certainly through all of this the benefits and drawbacks of strictly adhering to Confucian philosophy are made clear.  The book is also reminiscent of a Victorian comedy of manners.  The characters are concerned with love, destiny, and their social position, all shaped by Confucian protocol.  Unfortunately, this particular translation left me questioning why this story is considered China's best novel.  This condensed version was clearly a mistake.  I got a flavor for the story, but so much was lost that it would have been better to start with volume one of the long translation. (I have since discovered that the original is a five-volume edition.)  What you get with this short translation is a good feel for the main characters, especially the love triangle, and for the social dynamics within the family.  If you're short on time, consider this version as an appetizer before the full Chinese banquet of the original.  That said, it might also be better to read it in the original Chinese, if you have the privilege of being able to do so.  A family tree and a list of characters would also have been very helpful.  If you read it, create your own, as it can be difficult to keep track of who's who.","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tsao-Hsueh-Chin/product-reviews/0385093799/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",3
138,"The much anticipated concluding volume of the epic (if readers have persevered and made this far) settles the fate of our protagonist Jia Baoyu and expounds the nature of passion and illusion. The decadence of the Jia household thus concludes the Dream of the Golden Days. Following the death of the enamored Lin Daiyu, Baoyu weaves his way through a series of tragic events that plunge the Jia further into disgrace. Mourning bells incessantly resonate throughout the Rong-guo and Ning-guo houses as the financially stricken family prepare to encoffin the Old Lady Jia, Wang Xifeng, and a senior maid who demonstrates the purest essence of virtue and loyalty by following her mistress's footstep to death. There is a Chinese idiom that says 'mishap does not occur singly.' On top of the Jia's crumbling household and tremendous deficit in the occasion of mourning, robbers break into the Rong mansion and burglarizes all of the Old Lady's  belongings the sale of which the family depends upon to pay for the funerals. Majestic police raid the Ning mansion and confiscates property of Baoyu's uncle. Xifeng's loaning out of the Jia's money at exorbitant interests shamefully unveils as the officers find property deeds and notes bearing illegal interest rate, as well as garments and skirts restricted for palace use. Upon the closure of the Ning mansion, Jia She and his son are sentenced to penal servitude in remote region, leaving their women folks in inconsolable grief and desperate grip to seek financial security.  It is in the midst of the poignant havoc, against this multifarious backdrop that Jia Baoyu slowly comes to his realization about the illusion of passion and resolves to sever the ties with the material world. One by one events come to pass that was riddlingly foretold in the first volume. It seems sad but with expectation that the Twelve Jinling (twelve females who are close to Baoyu) all end up dying or in small circumstances. At the fulfillment of these prophecies, Baoyu weaves through these events like a somnambulist and finally through a dream-vision is awakened to the realization that life itself is but a dream. His grief for Daiyu and his general state of gloom are compounded as he perceives that Daiyu is no ordinary mortal (but a visitor from some immortal realm). Since his life has consisted for the most part of peaceful and pleasant pursuits and he had been protected from too close an acquaintance with real suffering, sudden loss of family fortune and Daiyu make him succumb to despair. Seeing through the human suffering and breaking from the lust-stained passion enlighten him.  While the Jias still cares for the enjoyment of splendor and concerned with the show of grandeur that is at best vanity, Baoyu realizes the predestined attachments of human heart are all of them mere illusions, which are obstacles blocking the spiritual path to joy. This inner change draws him to an unprecedented direction has proceeded insipiently unnoticed until he maintains a detached composure and makes no attempt to offer any solace to the tragic occurrences around the house. The karma has obviously completed its work as Baoyu has attained a clear perception of destiny. After all, THE DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER is about rising above all life's vices: all our lives we sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of greed, hatred, folly, and passion. The only way out of suffering, according to the working of the karma, is to escape the net of mortal life.","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tsao-Hsueh-Chin/product-reviews/0385093799/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5

This may be an anicent story, but because love is eternity, it is very much relatable.

144,"I am a Chinese student. Dream of the Red Chamber is my favorite novel, and it is definitely one of the greatest novel in the world. I've read the English version of this book as well, but I think the Chinese version is much better than the English one. Because this is a story happened in ancient China, 1700s, many of the poems in it can never exactly translate into English. The meanings of most characters' names can never show in the English version, either. For example, Chia Pao-yu, Chia means false in Chinese, yu means jade, Lin Tai-yu, Lin means forest and so on. If you don't know the special meanings of the characters' names, you can never understand the relationship between them. However, in the English version of this book, the names of the charaters are only the pronunciations. So if you really want to understand this fantastic story, the only advice I can give you is learning Chinese!","https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Red-Chamber-Tsao-Hsueh-Chin/product-reviews/0385093799/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",5

146,"Not to be a complete cornball, but I knew I was dizzy with love for this 18th century Chinese masterpiece when I stumbled over a passage where the incorrigible servant Tealeaf goes off on a bully with a wonderful verbal takedown, adding 'Be glad we haven't [naughty word]ed your dad.'  ...ah! I love learning about other cultures!  But really, 'dizzying' is the best word for this wonderful book. The central family tree is bursting into an entire forest, the narrator shifts in and out of plotlines willy-nilly ('Who the heck is this person again?' I said way too often), the Rongguo estate is described in extremely intimate detail, there are poems on every other page, and there is some proto-magic realism going on the whole time with demons, immortals, and fairies existing in dreams and maybe real life. It's all so...fascinating. It made me genuinely excited for reading in a way I haven't been in a long, long, long time.  Just like with any love, time for me to fess up there are some...issues. First of all, this is just 1 of 5 volumes, so it ends kinda abruptly and with 0 resolution. In fact, there is almost never any resolution ever. Or a plot period, to be honest. The story just saunters and putters around. Even the central love triangle between Dai-yu, Bao-chai, and Bao-yu hasn't really budged much so far (and by the way, Bao-yu is an incorrigible little brat. It aggravates me how much I like him).  But I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed all of this. My tip is to not fret so much about trying to figure out what's going on or how everyone relates to everyone. Once I just relaxed, I surprised myself how invested I got in Bao-yu, Xi-feng, Grandmother Jia, Aroma, Tealeaf, and all the big and petty going-ons at the mansion. I can absolutely see why scholars dedicate their lives and livelihoods to Cao's sprawling, funny, and heartbreaking work....  ...I reckon I'll need a cigarette bad by the time I'm finished with this whole thing.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
147,"This--the whole 5-volume set--remains China's greatest novel, and possibly the greatest novel in any language.  It is the subject of a whole field of studies in China ('Red Studies,' from the more usual Chinese title of the book, HUNG LOU MENG, 'A Dream of Red Mansions'). It really should be read by every educated person.   The other reviews on Amazon summarize the book well.  Some of them comment on the translation's accuracy, which I cannot do, being too feeble in my Chinese to follow its difficult prose.  There are several things to add, however.   I'm currently reading it for the 3rd time (I have also read the abridged translations), with an eye to studying the ways emotion is represented, for some work on emotions across cultures that I am involved in.  The interesting thing here is that the whole incredibly diverse, elaborate, and minutely described emotional landscape of the novel is instantly and totally accessible and comprehensible to a sensitive western reader (at least, to with some knowledge of Chinese conventions).  There is nothing remotely like the utterly alien, incomprehensible emotional and personal landscape that stereotypes and superficial western accounts ascribe to the Chinese.  There is also nothing like the utterly socialized Chinese, incapable of individuality, seen in most western accounts of cross-cultural psychology.  In fact, Cao's characters are sometimes quirky, sometimes downright eccentric, and always individuals and characters. This is (of course) a much more accurate portrayal of Chinese persons than the stereotyping western literature.   The western reader is even apt to do as Chinese readers often do, and identify Cao's characters with people they know. Cultural psychologists take note.   First is the stunning level of social commentary here, focused tightly and relentlessly on the plight of women in a traditional elite North Chinese household, but also on the plight of the servant and commoner classes in that elitist situation.  Cao Xueqin explores every possible misfortune that can befall good women (including being corrupted into not-so-good women).   Cao was humorous and gently ironic.  The brilliant but feckless and unpredictable hero Bao-yu survives largely because of his infinitely caring, sensible, always-there maid and lover Aroma.  Several of the other characters also depend on servants who are conspicuously more sane and competent than their masters and mistresses.   Nobody in the English-language literature seems to point out that this was part of a movement.  The great poets Zheng Xie and Yuan Mei were exact contemporaries of Cao Xueqin.  Cao would probably have known their work.  They had the same socially critical stance.  They had the same highly empathetic attitudes toward women, including women of the servant class.  If the latter phrase sounds very feudal and hierarchic, reflect, American readers:  our poets and novelists are very often elite New Englanders and New Yorkers; you know they have servants; yet it will be a cold day in Hell before you find a sympathetic portrait of a maid in any of their stuff.  Cao is way ahead.   Zheng and Yuan were also capable of the same sort of intensely personal, intimate, open writing about love that Cao managed so well.  There is a wonderful translation of one of Zheng's more painful and personal love poems in V. McHugh and C. Kwock, WHY I LIVE ON THE MOUNTAIN, a booklet that should be more widely known--alas rare and obscure.   Moreover, this humanistic attitude--toward women, or just toward everybody--spread to Japan; think of Rai Sanyo and Ryokan.  I doubt if they ever heard of Cao, but they surely had read Yuan Mei and very likely had read Zheng and others.   There were a good number of women writers at the time.  Some were proteges of Yuan Mei. No one seems to know what happened to the women in Cao's own personal life.   Chinese society in the early Qing Dynasty was horribly hierarchic and oppressive, not least to women, but the countercurrents represented by Cao and others were powerful and important.  They lie behind modern women's movements in East Asia.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

154,"The other reviews on here have told the outline and the important aspects of this first volume of The Story of the Stone, but I wanted to say this collection of five books started me on a whole new path and opened up the world of China to me. Until I read Cao Xueqin, I had no interest in China or chinese literature. These books are mesmerizing and addictive while educating you at the same time on the world of China in the 18th century. I have spent the last year reading everything I can find (from 1940 and back), and I owe my present passion to these wonderful books. I still say Cao Xueqin must have been a woman, as his descriptions and details of the women's lives then is so incredible and knowing. In a time when men and women lived fairly separate existences, this is kind of unusual I think. Although the main character is a young male, the books are primarily about the women, the grandmother, the aunts and cousins, and the servants. There are millions of people in it, it is like getting to know a whole city from another time and place, and often the stories of their lives are tragic. Full of intellectual games, and poetry, and religion, the books have layers of reality and dream. Truth and fiction. There is double meanings in almost everything. I wish there was more prose from this wonderful writer. And David Hawkes/John Minford are the cats meow for translators!

168,"This book is first of a five volume English translation of a Chinese classic, Dream of the Red Chamber (a.k.a. The Story of the Stone) composed by Cao Xueqin. It generally considered as one of China's Four Great Classical Novels. It was written sometime in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty, and the setting of the story is early in the 18th century.  This book was selected by Great Books KC group as our exposure to non-western literature for the year 2016. At the time Dream of the Red Chamber was selected for our schedule we didn't realize how long the complete work is. The Story of the Stone (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by John Minford, consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices). Total page count is 2,572. Our group decided to limit our discussion to the first volume as a more manageable reading assignment. I have no intention of completing the other four volumes any time in the foreseeable future.  It's my understanding that the complete story is about the beginning grandeur and eventual decline of the aristocratic Jia family clan. As indicated by its title, The Golden Days, this first volume is focused on the beginning prosperous years. The book provides a detailed insight into wealthy Chinese cultural life of the time and the story's narrative includes frequent use of poetry.  But this novel lays out a sprawling story line with numerous characters with names impossible for western readers to remember or pronounce. This is combined with excruciating details which at times can be beautiful, but overall becomes a heavy forest of words for the reader to slog through. Frankly, I didn't appreciate the experience very much. If I feel this way after the first volume I hate to imagine how I would feel should I manage to complete all five volumes.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_3?pageNumber=3",2

178,"Not too much to say. Dream is amazing and I'll leave my commentary on the actual novel itself there. David Hawkes did a good job, but his translation is lacking in many ways. Dream is full of puns and other language/character specific nuances. Much of the deep irony and symbolism is lost in limp and at times flippant name translations and confusing reproductions of titles that can easily leave the reader scratching their head. His choice to translate from a combination of texts provides perhaps too many opportunities for translating to become editing and revision. Still a good buy if you have no investment in Dream as anything but a cool novel someone told you about, but for those seeking a closer reading, it would be best to at least have a Chinese version at hand for comparison.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4",4

The days when these manifestations of the human condition would be viewed with horror seem far away.

182,"Let me first explicate a bit - perhaps add a disclaimer is more like it - about my approach to the book as contrasted with the other reviewers and my so-so experience of reading it.  I am neither Chinese nor a Chinese scholar, as most of the reviewers seem to be.  My only experiences with Chinese literature heretofore are Ezra Pound's translations of poets such as Li-Po and other much older poets from the Tang Dynasty period.  Thus, my approach to the book has consisted of that of a lover of Western literature dipping his toe into what all seem to regard as THE masterpiece of Asian literature.  I'm sorry if my review disappoints or rankles the devotees of this book.  On the other hand, it was my experience in reading this first volume and the review remains truthful to it.  First, I do concur that this volume was obviously a labour of love by English translator David Hawkes.  Indeed, I actually found his Introduction much more interesting than the book as a whole.  He goes well out of his way in both the Introduction and the Appendix to make things as easy on the English reader as possible.  Nevertheless, with 500+ characters and (according to both Hawkes and the Chinese reviewers/translators here) altogether too many puns and wordplay for the translator to convey them all, he is rather swimming against the tide.  Also, the turns of phrase and vocabulary employed by Hawkes are very British and quite archaic; and, whilst this was quite enjoyable to me, being a native of England and a lover of its literature, it does rather skew one's experience of reading it.  At times, Bao-yu and his feminine entourage come across as precocious flâneurs or 'bright young things' - a phrase Hawkes actually employs - of Interwar Oxonian vintage.  Be all this as it may, Cao Xueqin, or whoever wrote the first chapter (as this seems to be in scholarly dispute) anticipates my reaction to the book, in the form of the Stone in disquisition with Vanitas, from which I quote in part:  'I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time; I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy.'  On the other hand, Mr. Stone, Vanitas might have replied, 'It may not prove so.'  It certainly did not with me, for various reasons.  It is not an unpleasant read.  There's a sort of shimmering, limpid quality to the characters and the setting.  There are even some pearls amidst the paste in the translated poetry, such as:  'In vain we roam: Each in the end must call a strange land home.'  Or:  'Heaped charnel-bones none can identify Were golden boys and girls in days gone by.'  But, to sum up, what is missing in all the courtier-like atmosphere and sycophantic poetics in most of this book is any sort of tension, or suspense, or, most of all, any sort of inner life at all.  Several reviewers here mention Shakespeare in comparison to Xueqin.  I simply can't imagine any of the famous soliloquies occurring in the work, or any intense focus on the inner travails of the individual which make him or her so much more important than the milieu in which s/he is situated.  Herein, everything is milieu.  A pleasant, interesting milieu, granted; but it's still mere milieu.  I am full willing to grant that I may be missing something due to translation, or some idiosyncratic defect of my own, but I simply can't see, judging from this first volume, how this work can be considered great literature.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4",3
183,"I spend a lot of time wandering through bookstores.  One particular book has caught my eye over the years, and the other day I bought it - Volume 1 of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth century epic, 'The Story of the Stone:  The Golden Days'.  As a developing eighteenth century scholar, I was doubly attracted to it.  'The Golden Days' absolutely blew me away - used as I am to eighteenth century novels (British, French, American), this is wholly unlike anything I've read from the era.  It bears structural similarities to the Laurence Sterne's 'Tristram Shandy' and 'Sentimental Journey,' but aside from that bears more in common with ancient Greek novels like Longus's 'Daphnis and Chloe' or Heliodorus's 'Eithopian Romance,' as well as the mysticism of the ancient Egyptian 'Story of the Shipwrecked Sailor.'  And yet, Cao's attention to actual life experiences, and the detail he conveys about tradition and ceremony, along with frank dealings with human relationships and sexuality makes 'The Golden Days' much more than any quick summary of style or content can relate. 'The Golden Days' begins in amusing, but sympathetic fashion:  the goddess Nü-wa is repairing the sky with 36,501 stones.  When she finishes, one remains, which is cast off.  Having been touched by a goddess, this stone has magical properties, able to move, change size, and even talk.  One day, a Buddhist monk and a Taoist come upon the stone, and promise to let the stone have an adventure - to become human.  As the stone waits by a pond, it falls desperately in love with a Crimson Pearl Flower, which is also selected for incarnation by the Fairy Disenchantment.  The stone and the flower are incarnated as the novel begins in earnest, as a young minor nobleman named Jia Bao-yu, and a commoner related to the family, a girl named Lin Dai-yu - both unaware of their heavenly origins.  'The Golden Days' centers around the daily events and occurrences in the lives of these two teenagers, as they come to grips, as we all must, with human life. The Rong and Ning branches of the Jia family, on opposite sides of Two Dukes Street, are the centerpieces of the novel's action.  Like the 'big house' fiction of the English eighteenth century, these ancestral manses provide a locus of activity, as the nobles, their extended families, friends, and servants mingle and interact constantly.  Cao marks himself as a remarkable author by the way he handles a massive cast of characters, letting us into the private lives and concerns of all ranks of society, as well as the forms of etiquette that determine their relationships.  Another terrific facet of the novel's construction is the almost stream of consciousness style Cao employs - as characters pass in and out of the immediate action of the novel, the narrative seems to choose the person it's most interested in and follow them for pages at a time, before seamlessly passing to the next character.  It's really quite amazing, how, in this way, we come to understand the motivations, fears, and hopes of so many individuals.  Time, distance, culture, Cao levels distinctions, making historical China accessible to even 21st century readers - he reduces people to their human concerns. Cao Xueqin's novel is also remarkable for what I can only call it's pro(to)-feminist tone.  While we are reminded by certain characters that male lineage is of major importance to the structure of the society, the narrative consistently shows the power, ability, and influence of women.  At the novel's beginning, a Taoist named Vanitas finds the stone, and is asked to transcribe its story, but complains initially that it is about a 'number of females'.  The stone obviously insists that the story be written out.  Later, Bao-yu, the major male character, says he is more comfortable around women - that they are like water, while men are like mud, castoffs, unclean.  One of the main characters of this volume is Wang Xi-feng, a young woman in her early twenties, who for an extended period, manages the affairs of both the Ning and Rong mansions.  Cao's respect and admiration for the strong women in Bao-yu's life:  Xi-feng, Dai-yu, and two particular servants, Aroma and Caltrop, is quite obvious and important to the novel. If you are like me, and know tragically little about Chinese literature and culture, Cao takes care of that too - there is a heavy emphasis throughout the novel on the cultural productions of China.  The book integrates a wide range of poetry, drama, fiction, folk wisdom, and mythology as a central part of Bao-yu and Dai-yu's upbringing.  One can sense Cao's insistence in the novel that education and cultural production is of vital importance, particularly to children.  While the Fairy Disenchantment seems to be the guiding spirit of the novel, hinting at the diappointments inevitable in the course of life, this is a novel about youth, and hope for the future, even in the midst of concern about how long prosperity can last.  Taken altogether, 'The Golden Days' cannot be recommended enough.  David Hawkes's translation is first rate, and his introduction, pronunciation notes, and appendices are thorough and very helpful.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_4?pageNumber=4",5
184,"Written in 1750, The Story of the Stone is an impressive and fascinating tale that incorporates otherworldly magic and mysticism with the saga of wealthy Jia family.  The five-volume story chronicles the family's high-living glory days through their bitter decline, all the while immersing the reader in rich details of daily life in 18th century China.  I completely agree with the following quote from the Times Higher Educational Supplement: 'an astonishing book.  It recreates a world that would otherwise be utterly lost.'  Anyone even mildly interested in Chinese history and culture will be enthralled by this glimpse into the privileged world of wealthy 18th century Chinese. Author Cao Xueqin was truly a creative genius - Story of the Stone is multi-faceted, multi-dimensional, and superbly crafted. While reading the first chapter of the first book (Dream of the Red Chamber), I was struck with how utterly clever and imaginative the story is.  You will instantly be aware that you are reading something that has endured almost three hundred years for a very good reason.  The story is populated with dozens of wonderfully three-dimensional characters - many of whom are woven in and out of the story making for a most interesting read.  Most notable is the spoiled and curiously effeminate protagonist Jia Bao-yu, who possesses a special, magical item that I won't reveal here (don't want to spoil your enjoyment of the book!). All of the elements that make traditional Chinese literature such a joy to read are embodied in Story of the Stone.  Elaborate settings, delicate verse, and traditional symbolism (with a healthy dose of humor and bawdiness) create a beautiful and riveting story that will keep you wanting more.  I highly recommend reading the entire 5-book series.  It is impressive that a work can stand the test of time as well as Story of the Stone has. David Hawkes' fine translation is excellent.  Although some have criticized him for using too much 'slang,' I feel that his translation is effective in expressing the character's true sentiments, and it is tremendously easy to read.  Story of the Stone is an unforgettable and awesome read that I highly recommend.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",5
185,"Well, in my opinion anyway. David Hawkes has done an amazing job translating this brilliant 18th-century novel into colloquial modern English. I have read all the translations-- this is my favorite novel, and this is by far the best version for an English speaker who just wants a good book. I can imagine that a Chinese reader could pick holes in this translation, as I could nitpick at a translation of Shakespeare-- the wealth of the original is impossible to transfer whole into another language and culture. If you want a word-for-word translation so you can use this as a study guide while you read the Chinese, maybe the wooden Beijing Languages version could help you! But I have a hard time imagining any new translation being more vivid and fun to read than this one. Yes, it is littered with sometimes annoying Britishisms. That is the price of a colloquial translation! It's true that Hawkes does not explain all the references-- that would be another book in itself.  And I am sure he made mistakes-- I help a French translator occasionally and even though he is very well-versed in English, it is so easy for him to miss something that only a cultured native speaker could pick up. But this translation is ALIVE. Until that perfect translation comes along one day, Hawkes's is still better than all the others. Be grateful to him!

186,"The Dream of the Red Chamber (The Story of the Stone) starts off as an immensely long inscription on a miraculous stone which was copied out by a visiting man and taken down into the world for publication. Volume 1 gives the account of the magic stone's origin, renders the discourse redolent of a supernatural, mystical overtone. Once upon a time a piece of stone that was unworthy to be used for repairing the sky possessed magic power and ended up in the mortal world. The unhappy stone incarnated and lived out the life of a man before finally attaining nirvana and returning to what Buddhist refers as the 'other shore.'  Jai Baoyu is the incarnation of the stone. The name 'bao-yu' means 'treasured jewel' and was named after the wonderful incident that the only surviving son of the Jia household was born with a piece of spotless jade in his mouth. Lin Daiyu, Baoyu's teary cousin with a superior intelligence, is the incarnation of the Crimson Pearl Flower, which the unhappy stone once conceived a fancy that he took to watering everyday so the flower was able to shed the form of a plant and became a girl. The consciousness that she owed the stone ensued her to repay him with the tears shed during the whole of a mortal lifetime if they were ever to be reborn as humans in the world beneath. It was no wonder when Daiyu first saw her cousin, who had tyrannized the household, hated studies, and spent most of his time in women's quarters, it was as though she had seen him somewhere before, like a déjà vu.  Aside from the ethereal origin, the first volume of The Dream of the Red Chamber depicts a fairly eventual record of a great Manchu household (Qing Dynasty) under the tutelage of the Imperial family in early 18th century China. It's the picture of daily routines in the life that emerge most vividly from its discourse. The Jia household is genuinely disguised as some highborn aristocrats whose ancestors were ennobled for their military powers. This first installment of five parts, titled Golden Days, captures the Jias at the hi-time in which members of the Rong-guo mansion and the Ning-guo mansion dressed in silk, ate delicately, pampered by a domestic hierarchy of servants and maids, when they were still nested in the protecting shadow of the ancestors and the readily accessible wealth. The family's decline and fall constitute the general background of the novel.  With over 500 characters, thousands of one-hit appearances and a skein of household members and their distant relations of the clan, reading of The Dream of the Red Chamber will be more pleasurable and rewarding with the family genealogy handy. The book has a general flow of daily happenings and inter-family drama, with an emphasis on the relationship between Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu. Household activities, domestic anecdotes, subbing rivalries, seditious schemes, love affairs, contention between concubines, political intrigues, black magic, witchcraft, and even murder constitute to the pages of this Chinese epic that evokes Remembrance of Things Past and One Hundred Years of Solitude. The heart of the novel is the pre-destined relationship between a semi-ethereal entity and magic stone under the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion. This meeting, though is meant to be, is in vain, one that is full of tears.  When the fairy led Baoyu into the land of illusion and showed him his fate, he could scarcely make out of what he saw. Nature might have endowed him an eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. How does one expect a 13-year-old (scholars deem him to be 13 throughout most of the book) to recognize and seize his destiny? The fairy showed him not only his life cycle but also the romantic passions, love debts, heartbreaks of dust-stained human world. Baoyu was destined to mingle with girls around him. The ancestors thought Baoyu had inherited a perverse, intractable nature that rendered him eccentric and emotionally unstable. Exposure to the worldly illusions of decay might hopefully succeed in enlightening, awakening, and transforming him.  Daiyu seems to know Baoyu more thoroughly than anyone does. She is able to nail his problem despite her occasional tiff with him over trivial matters. Baoyu always complained about people's getting angry with whatever he did, but he never realized how much he had provoked them at the first place. Couplets, poems, and verses in the novel hint at his friendlessness in the mortal world and the incessant debate over the depth of his relation with Daiyu. The roaming back and forth, sink and soar between sorrow and elation between the two incarnated cousins constitute to the understanding that earthly existence is indeed a transience but karma determines the shape of one's life and the life after. This idea of life being a dream from which one eventually awakes is a Buddhist tenet, but the incorporation of it into the novel becomes a poetic gesture to demonstrate that the main character (Baoyu) is indicative to the author.  The Dream of the Red Chamber in Chinese has the connotation of being rich and grand. The title can refer to a dream of the vanished splendor and opulence. The frequent use of dream imagery implies the possibility that the luxurious world of the author's youth, which he attempted to reconstruct, had vanished so utterly at the time of writing. The story of the Jias closely accorded with fortunes of Cao's own family, which attained its height under the reign of Kangxi. But the exact relationship existing between characters of the novel and members of Cao family is uncertain and discreet. Baoyu is assured to be author's self-portrait, whose struggle towards emotional maturity was delineated with an affluence of nuance. Other characters could be compsite of several family members over different generations for the purpose of disguising facts.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",2
187,"I'm surprised that I had never heard of this novel until recently. Covering five volumes and over 2,000 pages, it was written in the eighteenth century and depicts the life of the aristocracy in ancient China.  The first volume introduces us to many characters, and it's tough getting them all sorted out, mostly due to names that are quite foreign to Western readers.  However, the narrative is so natural and flows so easily, I found it quite easy to submerge myself in the story.  Perhaps the translation is to be credited, because although the tale is set over 250 years ago, I never felt as though the characters were anything but recognizably human.

188,"I just finished a class devoted to the study of The Story of the Stone (aka Honglou Meng, Dream of the Red Chamber) and feel completely awed by the complexity and skill of Cao Xueqin. This novel thoughtfully and naturally weaves together several timeless human themes. If you enjoy literature which requires analysis at several different levels simultaneously, you'll love this book. Two notes for those who don't speak Chinese: 1)Learning the characters' names is difficult even for those with a background in Chinese, but the translator does do readers a favor by translating servants' names into English equivalents/approximations while leaving the names of the main family members in (romanized) Chinese. 2)Keep in mind that two of the most important families are named Jia and Zhen, which mean 'false, phony, artificial' and 'true, real, genuine' respectively. (This is just one of many iinteresting and meaningful messages inevitably lost in translation) Also, in my opinion, the first three volumes (written by Cao) are much better than the last two volumes (written by Gao E). Still, it's interesting to compare the ways Gao changes the story.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",4

190,"This is the first volume of a 5 volume series, and does not stand alone. If you read it, and enjoy it, be prepared to read the other four volumes. The story is difficult to begin with, not for lack of interest, but because of the complexity of Chinese names for the western reader. The book is  provided with a useful list of characters for each volume, and after  referring to this during the first half of the first volume, all becomes  clearer for the remainder of the book. The story itself is a fascinating  picture of life in 18th century China, and portrays the development of a  young boy who has otherworldly origins. The western reader needs to view  dispassionately the Buddhist theme which pervades the novel, but when read  with an open mind, the philosophy underlying the novel is both charming and  practical (in its own way). I found the book addictive, though it has to  be said that others of my acquaintance found it too difficult to cope with,  and abandoned the story before the end of the first volume. If you  persevere, it forms a wonderful introduction to classical Chinese  literature, and those similarly addicted will find it leads into many other  books of Chinese prose and poetry.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_5?pageNumber=5",4

Rather, Story provides an engaging peek into the lives of an upper-class family in feudal China. The story takes a little patience at the beginning due to the large number of characters. But the reader will soon realise that how the characters are related to one another is not crucial to appreciating the book.

I believe that the reader will, like me, come to feel for the characters in no time and look forward to finding out how their lives evolved in the later four volumes.

192,"I think the most important quality of this piece of literature that qualifies it among the all-time classics is the layering of progressive ideas within traditional Chinese philosophy and structure. The oppression censorship required Cao Xueqin to disguise all relatively innovative and rebellious themes under apparent themes of acceptance the current political and cultural status quo. The strict censorship also explains why the final editors toned down the material before publishing the novel and the last 2 volumes fail to remain faithful to the true gold of the first 3 volumes.  All good literature questions society and the individual, a skill in which Cao Xueqin proves to master. I highly recomend this book to any patient readers. If you struggle with deciphering the complex web of Chinese philosophy, I also recommend reading Andrew Plaks' 'Archetype and Allegory in Dream of the Red Chamber'.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140442936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_6?pageNumber=6",5

199,"Volume 3 finds the significant idea in Buddhist that one would open his eyes to the vanity of human affections and causes a person to renounce the world, for one no longer subscribes to the conventions of the mundane, dust-stained world and thrives to be detached from it.  The title of this gripping, escalating volume, The Warning Voice, duly confirms the intractable decadence of the Jias. Tolstoy's opening line in Anna Karenina best describes the unfavorable miasma - 'All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.' Outsiders look at the Jias and all its wealth and immediately think how happy the Jias must be, they don't realize the vexations far outweigh the advantages and privileges. Being a big family with its numerous maids' converting to mistresses and concubines, daily fuss and drama are inevitable. These mistresses are conceited, usually full of their own importance, and always take offense at the most trivial matter, and at the slightest bit of cross do they begin to spread rumors to stir up trouble. It is under such quarrelsome milieu that the Jias gradually wanes. Volume 3 begins with the domestic hierarchy of maids in the house and how in the sabbatical of Xi-feng from managing house duties the well being of the family is left at the mercy of the senior maids.  In the event of an imperial member's death, the Jia ladyships take to daily excursion to the palace where they attend ceremonies during the mourning period (usually spans 100 days during Ming and Qing dynasties). Their stewards and stewardesses are no less occupied with accompanying them and seeing that preparations are readied ahead of time. Lacking discipline normally imposed by these officers and being deprived of Xi-feng's invidiously stringent implementation of rules on the operation of the house, domestics of both mansions (Rong and Ning) grow slovenly in the duties. Some take advantage of the exceptional circumstances to allay themselves with those placed temporarily in charge. Others, like the ex-actresses who remain under the Jias' patronage, become so imperious, demanding and fastidious about their commodities that the servants remain silent to avoid disputations. The urgent call for economizing adds fuel to the flame as the household is plagued by quarrel over the harvest of the garden, which is divided up among the growers and keepers. In a matter of weeks, happenings within the mansion render the whole place in a state of mutiny. The Rong and Ning mansions are inevitably left at the mercy of the few loyal, experienced senior maids who even go as far as bending authority to spare an innocent maid the accusation of stealing.  Some of the most memorable scenes of THE DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER are indubitably those that concern Jia Lian's secret second marriage and its aftermath. The cunning Xi-feng deliberately conceals her knowledge of the shameful matter and executes her plan silently. Keeping her anger at bay and taking advantage of her rival's lacking in guile, Xi-feng entreats her rival to live with her, feigns kindness and makes her rival feel reassured about her future in the bosom of so delightful a family. Xi-feng's forbearance and outward gesture of kindness greatly mystify everyone who knows about the matter but little does anyone know about her true intent to rid of this new mistress. The treacherous Xi-feng surreptitiously draws up a fictitious court case accusing her own husband of taking an unlawful wife during national mourning and family mourning in order to rid of her rival indirectly. Her strategy is to stir up a betrothal agreement concerning her rival in the old days and manipulates the formerly affianced to bring a written indictment against her own husband before the court.  Insubordination and deterioration of moral standard infest the garden and infuriate Lady Wang. In her opinion each one of the maids in the garden is potential corrupter of her son Bao-yu. She orders a raid of the garden at the awestruck finding of a lewd picture. Secret investigation on the obscene brick-a-brac immediately takes place with such single-minded persistence and orders all maids to be subjected to her scrutiny. The unforeseen incidence raises alarm in Lady Wang about Bao-yu's squandering his time in the garden. Bao-yu is unprepared for the raging tempest that has just passed over him. The things his mother charges the maids with so uncanny a knowledge of even his most intimate conversations with them that there seem a little point in denial.  This volume faintly presages Bao-yu's determination to grip his own destiny. He thrives to live his life as he wants to and recognizes life'' uncertainty. This is significant in his defiance over the family-decided marriage to Bao-chai and his firm refusal to let go of his feeling and affection for Lin Dai-yu. It can be inferred that in his ineffable pain of losing Dai-yu that he has conceived the incipient thought to break away from the dust-stained world. Buddhist teaching dictates the second half of this climax-reaching volume of the novel. At the depletion of wealth and the dimming of glitter the truth of Buddha outshines the taste of luxury that is proven to be vanity at best. Out of the sea of suffering, one might turn the light and resolve to abjure the world and its vanities in order to prepare for the life to come. This idea burgeons toward the end of The Warning Voice as a sign and will be further explored in Volume 4.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Warning/product-reviews/0140443703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5

201,"The Dream of the Red Chamber is one of the most famous novel in China. Despite the fact that there are over four hundred characters in the story, the author managed to capture the essence of each one brilliantly. All the characters seem to come alive under the author's pen. One thing worth mentioning is that, Cao actually led a life plagued by poverty. What flamboyance he described in the book came from his childhood memories. The rise and fall of the Rong's family conveys the author's central idea - that life is really just a dream. Unfortunately, it is often beyond man's ability to see through the haze and escape from the disappointment of such. What we seeked in the past - wealth and fame - continue to be our desire of present times. Such abject view of life is reflected in the story of the hero - jia bao yu - who in the end decided to spend the rest of his life as a monk to ponder the meaning of existence. All in all, the Dream in the Red Chamber does not only reflect the situation in modern China, but also tells the story of Chinese ethics and love. A must read if one desires to learn more about China.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Warning/product-reviews/0140443703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",4

212,"This review is about all five volumes of the series. This was my first foray into the translated Chinese volumes that are generally referred to as The Story of the Stone or The Dream of the Red Chamber. After reading the scholarly reviews, I was skeptical that the work would appeal to me on simply a 'consumer-reader-student-of-history' level. And it was such a different style that all I could think during the first volume was Really? This is the iconic symbolism of post-Western-contact of China? But the fables grow on you, the icons surface, and the style becomes more familiar. I've never encountered the use of 'small action' in such a relevant way; all the fol-de-rol about meals, kowtowing, hedonism vs. tradition, the ceremonies of ancestor worship begins to blend into a bigger picture, and one that most readers, regardless of culture, will recognize.  I slogged through, and found the stories engaging, the descriptions of the culture fascinating, and the plotlines very different from western stories. The time invested in completing the series was a joy. Thankfully, a glossary of individual names, relationships, and even the family trees for the families most involved appears in each volume. I was a complete novice about Chinese naming conventions; the names themselves were confusing until the third book.  It's usually difficult to find all five volumes, so I thank Amazon for pulling the Penguin versions together.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140443711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",5
213,"Nothing good lasts forever, whether we are talking about the Garden or this novel itself… Volumes 4 and 5 are thought to be written by Gao E a generation after Cao Xueqin’s untimely death.  There has been rampant speculation since the appearance of these last 40 chapters in 1791 as to how faithfully they followed Cao’s original intention and how much material Gao E had to work with in editing it all together.  I wish that David Hawkes, the translator of the first three volumes, had continued to translate these final two volumes.  I would then be able to say more definitively whether the author’s voice or the quality of the writing changes that greatly.  I do not believe that our new translator, John Minford, is quite as skilled as Hawkes.  I guess this means that someday I will have to read a version completely translated by the same person, perhaps Gladys Yang’s. Anyway, back to the story itself.  We continue to see the struggle between lineal descendants as Jia Zheng has returned to make Bao-yu study.  Everywhere the family is falling apart and the conflicts play out as expected: young vs. old, mistress vs. servant, husband vs. wife.  In the first 80 chapters there was an interplay between characters’ (major and minor) storylines that helped me feel the texture of their everyday lives.  Incidents would ebb and flow until some great event occurred which stopped everything.  Gradually the plot would get rolling again but in a different direction than I had assumed.  This no longer happens.  Things go about as one would expect.  Again, this is the price we readers pay for having these last 40 chapters assembled at all.  The previous volumes each took me at least two months to read.  I frequently had to stop due to feeling overwhelmed by the richness of detail and characterization.  With this volume I was able to read as compulsively as I had always wanted but never got exhausted.  The writing is now heavy on dialogue, and none of it particularly rich or layered (as I said before, I cannot say for certain whether this is due to Gao E, John Minford or both, though perhaps if David Hawkes had continued as translator he might have improved on the original however slightly.)  The upside is that I finished the book in ten days. When characters do have inner thoughts they are always of something established in the first 80 chapters (Aroma wonders what will become of her as a concubine, Dai-yu feels like an outsider, etc).  And although I felt chapters 80-90 were somewhat clunky, I settled into a groove and enjoyed the second half of this volume.  Or perhaps Gao E had better notes or fragments to work from, since Cao had perhaps finished 110 chapters and tended to lend them to his friend/relative/editor Rouge Inkstone in increments of 10.  We will never know.  Despite my previous complaints, there is one relationship that continues to develop, that which is between Nightingale and Dai-yu.  Nightingale’s mad dash around the Garden during the critical time for Dai-yu was incredibly suspenseful and heartbreaking.  I’ve always been surprised at how emotional I can get about these characters, and I am even more surprised that I continue to be moved by Gao E’s chapters.  Although chapters 80-90 struck me as a bit flat, the chapters leading up to the wedding have been presented quite believably by presenting the complicated motivations and actions surrounding the grand substitution.  Although I was never a huge Dai-yu fan, I appreciated her aesthetic and pitied her situation.  However, I probably would have wanted my son to marry Bao-chai, and not for jade and gold reasons, but because she is very solid and sensible.  My favorite character continues to be Tan-chun, who embodies the best qualities of Dai-yu and Bao-chai.  I was surprised and comforted to see her at Dai-yu’s deathbed.  I hope she makes it out okay, but I don’t have high hopes for anybody at this point.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/0140443711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",4

220,"If you've read the novels this far, you want to know how it all ends.  The translator, however, in his preface, indicates that many things contribute to this volume seeming convoluted and straying from the general theme of the previous books.  First, Cao Xueqin lost some of the final chapters when he asked family/friends to proofread, and the last chapters are certainly finished by another author.  This author (or even authors) may have been unaffiliated readers who wrote the equivalent of fan-fiction to finish off the story, heavily influenced by fear of writing anything that could be construed as criticism of the emperor, or motivated by a desire to be the first publisher with a 'complete' edition.  You get some closure--the story draws to an end and homage is paid to the theological theme of realizing the primacy of the spiritual world over the material world.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say that you are expecting a fall from grace with a stalwart conviction that life isn't over--a Chinese version of the Book of Job--but you get a lot of deus ex machina events that give it more of a fairy tale ending than what Cao Xueqin hinted at throughout the first three volumes.","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/014044372X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_1?pageNumber=1",3

This book represents the second set of 20 chapters out of the 40 reputedly edited and redacted by Gao E, and arguments about the chapters' validity (both as a work in themselves and as part of Cao Xueqin's novel) are a sort of scholarly pastime.  The most salient comment on the problem may be the one offered by John Minford when he writes that regardless of academic debates, these chapters are what we have, and they 'have been accepted as *the* ending for centuries.'  Minford's translation continues to be a worthy successor to David Hawkes' version of the first 80 chapters, and I found this last volume to be more satisfying than I had often heard.  At this point, recommendations are all but moot; no one should be starting the story here, and if you've come this far there's no good reason not to read the last 400 pages.  ~","https://www.amazon.com/Story-Stone-Dream-Chamber-Vol/product-reviews/014044372X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_next_2?pageNumber=2",5
